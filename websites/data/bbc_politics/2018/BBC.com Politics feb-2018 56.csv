2018-02-01,May to fight post-Brexit residency move,https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42896996,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has indicated she will fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizens during the transition period after Brexit.She said there had to be a ""difference"" between those arriving after the UK leaves and those who came before.She also sought to reassure Tory MPs worried about the length of transition. Meanwhile, government analysis has emerged suggesting the cost of cutting EU migration would be much greater than the benefits of a US trade deal.BuzzFeed News has claimed government studies on the economic impact of Brexit say reducing migration from the bloc into the UK would nullify the benefits of any trade deal struck with Washington.Ministers agreed on Wednesday to let MPs see another leak from the same impact analysis which suggests the economy would be worse off as a result of a number of possible Brexit scenarios.In response to the fresh leak, a government spokesperson said the UK would forge new and ambitious trade deals but remain an ""open and tolerant country"" while ensuring there is control of migrants.Earlier this week, the EU set out what it was prepared to offer the UK, saying it expected the transition to last from the day of the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020.But reports that it could be extended have dismayed some Brexit-supporting MPs. Speaking during her trade trip to China, Mrs May insisted such an ""implementation period"" would last about two years.""We are not talking about something that is going to go on and on...We're leaving the European Union. There is an adjustment period for businesses - and indeed government - for changes that need to be made,"" she said.By Laura Kuenssberg, political editorInternational Trade Secretary Liam Fox is in China and wants his restive colleagues at home to focus on the big picture. Listing the number of deals that have been done already this week during the prime minister's visit he told me that building levels of trade with China is a real ""success story"". No 10 is confident that by the end of this marathon trip well over £9bn of new contracts will have been secured - such a high profile political investment edging deals over the line. Dr Fox accepts it will take some to get trade deals done in the longer term. The UK will be limited not just before Brexit, but also during the transition period, in how much can get done. Read more from LauraIn December, the two sides agreed a deal setting out the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British expats on the continent.All EU nationals who have been in the UK for more than five years will be expected to be granted settled status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as now.Those who have been resident for a shorter period but who arrived before Brexit will be able to stay until they reach the five-year threshold. At the time, Downing Street said it envisaged anyone arriving after Brexit being able to continue to live, work and study in the UK but that they would need to register and the immigration details would have to be agreed as part of the wider transition negotiations.The EU has since said it expects existing rules on freedom of movement - including the path to permanent residency - to apply in full until the end of the transition phase.Mrs May, who is on the second day of a three-day trade trip to China, said she would contest the issue of long-term residency rights when transition negotiations begin in earnest next month. ""When we agreed the citizens' rights deal in December we did so on the basis that people who had come to the UK when we were a member of the EU had set up certain expectations,"" she said.""It was right that we have made an agreement that ensured they could continue their life in the way they had wanted to - now for those who come after March 2019 that will be different because they will be coming to a UK that they know will be outside the EU.""""I'm clear there is a difference between those people who came prior to us leaving and those who will come when they know the UK is no longer a member.""The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who is travelling with the prime minister, said Mrs May was showing she was willing to push back against the EU amid discontent on the Conservative benches.Labour MP Peter Kyle said anything that caused uncertainty for EU workers in the UK was bad for business.""EU citizens who come here to work and make an enormous contribution to our country, including in our public services and our NHS, should be welcomed and valued rather than turned away,"" he said.In another development, the government's flagship EU (Withdrawal Bill) cleared its first hurdle in the House of Lords as it passed its second reading and former Labour minister Lord Adonis withdrew an amendment calling for a referendum on the final deal.

The agenda is expected to cover trade and security issues, including North Korea's nuclear programme.The PM is in China at the head of a 50-strong business delegation.She will also raise environmental concerns - and present Mr Xi with a box-set of the BBC's Blue Planet II series, with a personal message from presenter Sir David Attenborough. The show examined the effect of human behaviour on the environment and was referenced by Mrs May last month when she pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042 as part of a 25-year green strategy.On the first day of her trip the prime minister announced a UK-China effort to strengthen international action against the illegal trade in ivory.She also said Mr Xi's initiative to establish overland transport links between China and Europe would be discussed at their meeting.In Beijing on Wednesday, the prime minister and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang agreed on a new trade and investment review, which is seen as a stepping stone to a full free trade agreement after Brexit.Mr Li said China would further open up its markets to the UK, including to agricultural products and financial services.UK-China trade is currently worth a £59bn a year and Mrs May has said she expects deals worth a further £9bn to be signed during the course of her visit.One of the UK companies travelling with the PM, health-tech firm Medopad, has said it signed more than £100m of commercial projects and partnerships with organisations including China Resources, GSK China, Peking University and Lenovo.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the prime minister would want to build on the warm words from China when she meets Mr Xi, amid pressure on her from her own party and Brussels in recent days.Earlier this week, the EU set out what it was prepared to offer the UK in the Brexit transition period.Speaking in China, Mrs May sought to reassure Tory MPs worried about the length of transition, saying it would last about two years and was not ""something that is going to go on and on"".She also indicated she would be fighting an EU proposal to give its citizens moving to the UK during the transition period after Brexit residency rights.In a separate development, BuzzFeed News has claimed government studies on the economic impact of Brexit suggest that reducing migration from the bloc into the UK would nullify the benefits of any trade deal struck with the US.Ministers agreed on Wednesday to let MPs see another leak from the same impact analysis which suggest the economy would be worse off as a result of a number of possible Brexit scenarios.Meanwhile, the government's flagship EU (Withdrawal Bill) has cleared its first hurdle in the House of Lords as it passed its second reading and former Labour minister Lords Adonis withdrew an amendment calling for a referendum on the final deal.

""He has received support from across the House and we are pleased he has decided to continue in his important roles at the Department for International Development and HM Treasury.""Lord Bates described himself as ""ashamed"" to not be in his place to answer a question from Labour's Baroness Lister.""It's been my privilege to answer questions from this despatch box on behalf of the government,"" he told peers. ""I've always believed we should rise to the highest possible standards of courtesy and respect in responding on behalf of the government to the legitimate questions of the legislature.

2018-02-01,Scots minister 'will publish EU analysis',https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-42889904,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Scottish government has said it will publish the UK government's controversial Brexit briefing paper if it is given it. The document, which was leaked to Buzzfeed earlier this week, predicts that Brexit will hit the UK economy.The UK government said releasing the analysis to the public could damage its negotiations with the EU.But Scotland's Brexit secretary, Michael Russell, said the public had a right to know.Downing Street announced on Wednesday that MPs and peers would be able to see the report on a confidential basis, after initially refusing to do so.UK government had also made it clear that the document would be shared with the devolved administrations - but that it would need to be ""handled with appropriate confidentially"".However, in a letter to his UK government counterpart, David Davis, Mr Russell said the Scottish government would release the information to the public even if it is asked not to do so.Mr Russell argued that people ""have a right to know the impact on jobs and living standards of the UK government's decision to pursue the UK's exit from the EU"".He added: ""Further, this is not our analysis and we do not see it as our responsibility to make arrangements on confidential handling.""I want to be clear that if you send the analysis to us we will make it public"".The UK government said it had not yet received Mr Russell's letter, so could not comment directly on it. But Brexit minister Robin Walker told the Commons on Wednesday that it was ""for the devolved administrations to ensure that such documents are handled with appropriate confidentiality"".He also said the UK government had ""no objection in principle to their being shared with members of the devolved legislatures on the same basis of confidentiality"". The leaked study suggests that in three different scenarios the UK economy would grow more slowly than it would if it stayed in the European Union.The government has argued that the document is incomplete, and that immediate publication could damage UK negotiations with the EU.Theresa May initially told reporters en route to China, where she is on a trade mission, that making the analysis public before it was fully completed would be ""wrong"".But with the government facing potential defeat in the vote on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Walker told MPs a copy of the report would be given to Hilary Benn, the Labour chairman of the Commons Brexit committee.He added: ""A confidential reading room can be provided for other MPs and peers a copy of this analysis to view the material on a confidential basis. This will happen only when arrangements can be made.""Mr Russell's letter was published ahead of new UK Cabinet Office minister David Lidington arriving in Edinburgh for talks with Scottish government ministers about Brexit. Mr Russell and Deputy First Minister John Swinney set out their concerns over devolved powers and Brexit legislation, but described the talks as being ""very frustrating"" as Mr Lidington ""arrived and left without putting words on the table to allow for a meaningful discussion"".Mr Russell said: ""The UK government has rejected Scottish and Welsh government amendments that would protect devolution but, despite its previous commitment, has failed to bring forward any solution of its own.""Despite many meetings, once again the UK ministers arrived and left without putting words on the table to allow for a meaningful discussion.""So we are still in the position that the Scottish government cannot and will not recommend that the bill should receive legislative consent.""Mr Lidington insisted the talks had been ""useful"", adding: ""There are issues that still need to be resolved on the Withdrawal Bill but I remain optimistic that we can find a way forward.""There are areas that we agree on. We both want all parts of the UK to be ready for the day that we leave the EU.""The UK government and the devolved administrations are at loggerheads over what happens to powers currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are currently exercised from Brussels, when the UK leaves the EU.The current proposals in the EU Withdrawal Bill would see all powers return to London before some are fully devolved and others are integrated into UK-wide frameworks, but the Edinburgh and Cardiff administrations term this a ""power grab"" - phrasing Mr Lidington rejected on Thursday.UK ministers had pledged to amend the legislation to assuage these concerns, but ran out of time to do so while the bill was under consideration in the Commons. They now say it will be amended in the Lords, but the devolved administrations have started work on their own stop-gap legislation in preparation for a scenario where consent for the Withdrawal Bill is withheld.Mr Lidington is taking on the role of Damian Green, his predecessor as Cabinet Office minister who led for the UK government in negotiations with the devolved administrations. He was visiting Cardiff and Edinburgh in this role for the first time on Thursday."
2018-02-01,MPs vote to leave Parliament during refit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42891608,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs have voted to leave the Palace of Westminster while a proposed multi-billion pound refurbishment of the historic building takes place.The Commons approved a motion calling for a ""full and timely decant"", designed to allow essential repairs, by 236 votes to 220.The planned move, part of a proposed £5.6bn modernisation, will not take effect until 2025 at the earliest. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the era of ""patch and mend"" had to end.The Lords will vote on the future of the iconic building next week. Although the government has said the decision is a matter for Parliament, Ms Leadsom said the iconic building faced ""critical risks"", with 60 episodes in recent years which could have led to a serious fire.While any full-scale restoration programme would be likely to see MPs and peers leave for a ""significant"" amount of time, she said the Palace of Westminster ""will always remain the home of Parliament"" and this would be guaranteed in future legislation. While Parliament needed to get on with the matter, she said the business planning must be rigorous to ensure value for money for the taxpayer.During a three hour debate on the issue, several MPs argued that Parliament risked becoming a safety risk for all those who worked in it and urgent action was needed.As well as the threat of fire, the building is seen as vulnerable because of its antiquated sewerage system and areas of the palace, which was largely rebuilt in the 19th Century after it burnt down, are riddled with asbestos.A review by accountants Deloitte in 2014 estimated that a full decant would cost between £3.5bn and £3.9bn, a partial decant between £3.9bn and £4.4bn and a rolling programme of works, with Commons and Lords chambers being ""vacated and then re-occupied"" and lead to longer recesses, up to £5.67bn. The motion passed authorises MPs to approve essential repairs but agree to review the ""need for comprehensive works"" before the next election, which is due in 2022.In 2016, the Joint Committee on the Palace of Westminster warned that the decision on how to refurbish Parliament could not be delayed any further and backed a ""full and timely decant"" to Richmond House, a nearby building in Whitehall currently used by the Department of Health. Backing this option. Labour's Chris Bryant said for MPs to want to stay in the building while extensive building work was taking place was ""bonkers"" and they had a duty to preserve Parliament for the next 100 to 200 years. ""I say to colleagues, it is really time we got a grip of the situation and voted for something which might be inconvenient for us but is in the long-term interests of the nation,"" he told Sky News.But Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said he could no longer support the plan because the measurements had changed and the bulk of Richmond House would have to be demolished to make way for a replica chamber in its courtyard, considerably increasing the cost of the project.DUP MP Ian Paisley said there was ""no cheap option"" and anyone who believed this was ""deluded"".""There is necessary work that needs to be done and necessary money that needs to be spent,"" he said.Labour's Stephen Pound said it was vital that parliamentarians kept a ""footprint"" in the historic building, insisting ""we cannot lose this, we have fought too hard for this"". But the SNP's Pete Wishart said the estimates for the various options were ""eye-watering"" and he would not be surprised if the entire project ended costing between £10bn and £12bn.In a time of ""austerity and belt-tightening"", he said he suspected refurbishing MPs' place of work would be ""near the bottom or at the bottom"" of the public's list of priorities.

2018-02-01,Domestic abuse law 'could change Scotland',https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-42890990,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA bill to criminalise psychological domestic abuse has been passed, with some campaigners saying it ""could change Scotland forever"".The Domestic Abuse bill, which has wide backing, creates a specific offence of ""abusive behaviour in relation to a partner or ex-partner"".This includes psychological abuse such as coercive and controlling behaviour as well as violence.Critics claimed it could be difficult to gather sufficient evidence.However MSPs voted by 118 to one to pass the legislation, with every member speaking in favour during the final debate.It later emerged that Conservative Margaret Mitchell - who had spoken of the ""total consensus"" behind the bill - had recorded the only vote against.She said she pressed the wrong button during the vote and blamed the mistake on not wearing her glasses.Members stood to applaud domestic abuse survivors in the public gallery after the result was announced.Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said it was a ""momentous day"", saying laws would now ""reflect the experience all to many women have suffered"".He said: ""Attitudes towards domestic abuse have changed considerably since this Parliament was established in 1999. Back then, some were of the mindset that domestic abuse - especially where it did not involve physical violence - was a private matter. Attitudes have rightly changed - albeit further work is needed to challenge lingering outdated or dismissive attitudes.""I am very grateful to the domestic abuse survivors who presented their evidence to the justice committee. ""Their courage helped shaped the legislation I brought to parliament, and their actions will help the justice system prosecute those who commit one of society's most insidious crimes.""The new legislation says abusive behaviour is:Behaviour that is violent, threatening or intimidatingBehaviour whose purpose is one of the following: The offence is aggravated if any of the behaviour is directed at a child or witnessed by them.However, Dr Marsha Scott, the chief executive of Scottish Women's Aid, said she was ""excited"" about the legislation.She said: ""Women have been telling us for 40 years that it is psychological and emotional abuse that is the most traumatic for them and the hardest to recover from, yet for such a long time we had absolutely no tools in legislation to take their stories seriously and hold abusers accountable for the untold harm that they wreak.""Ms Scott said it was the first bill in the world to create a way of ""victimless prosecution"".She said: ""It does not blame women and it does not mean women have to come into court and prove how harmed they have been by the abuse.""In fact it is all structured in looking at the behaviour of the perpetrator and asking 'would a reasonable person think that this could be harmful?'.""Looking back Jennifer says it is ""as clear as day"" that she suffered emotional abuse in her relationship with her ex-boyfriend.However, at the time, she did not realise how bad it was because it was ""death by a thousand cuts"".""You think 'he doesn't like that so I'd better change that bit about me',"" she says. ""You start to clock up these ideas of 'I'd better not wear this' or 'if I say this or I'm too loud then maybe it's my fault'.""Read Jennifer's storyGrazia Robertson, a criminal solicitor in Glasgow, told BBC Scotland it could be difficult to secure prosecutions.""How would you gather sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute in a criminal court?"" she said""I think there will be problems.""She said the bill acknowledges that prosecutions may not be able to rely on evidence from the person who has been abused.""You may be relying on the evidence or perceptions of other people and that will make it more difficult,"" she said.Dr Scott, from Scottish Women's Aid, said: ""There are a lot of myths out there that somehow it will be hard to get evidence to support prosecutions. ""Actually it is much harder to corroborate a threat to someone that is a one-off. ""This law will take an incident and look at it as a course of conduct. ""That will then mean there are lots of opportunities to gather evidence - there are texts, receipts and financial abuse, there are friends' stories, there are all kinds of things that will help to provide evidence of what was going on.""She said there was work to be done to build the confidence of victims and the training of police and prosecutors but ""this week we will know there is a possibility that this law will change Scotland forever""."

Lord O'Neill of Gatley, the former Treasury minister who was instrumental in setting up the Northern Powerhouse with Mr Osborne, told the BBC that although the Northern Powerhouse had dropped out of the ""top five"" government priorities, there did appear to be a fresh focus on the project.""It's not as big,"" he admitted when I asked him if Theresa May placed as much emphasis on the Powerhouse as Mr Osborne had done.""What I would say more encouragingly, it seems pretty clear to me that attention on the Northern Powerhouse has increased.""If you go right back to the prime minister's first speech on the Downing Street steps it is very clear that she's sympathetic to the whole goal of doing something like the Northern Powerhouse.""Lord O'Neill said that supporting the economy in the north was important for the whole of Britain.""For the past couple of years the north west part of the Powerhouse has been outperforming the whole country and that outperformance is accelerating.""If you look at the past 20 years around the world, over 60% of all economic growth is being driven by bigger urban places and the UK only has one in the world's top 50 - London.""London is a huge contributor financially to the rest of the country - it's not really ultimately that good for London or the rest of the country if they're dependent on handouts from London.""If you have your own local engine that is economically as powerful as London, you know it's a game changer for the nation."""

Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said HMRC was working to resolve the long-running problems with the website.But ""at the moment, applying for tax-free childcare and the 30 hours via the online system is a complete lottery - while some parents have been able to use the service without issue, others are still facing a range of technical problems often preventing them from being able to do the simplest things"".""Given this system is meant to underpin two of the government's flagship childcare policies, clearly more needs to be done to rectify these ongoing problems,"" Mr Leitch said.""This is particularly true of tax-free childcare, given that the childcare voucher scheme is due to close to new entrants in April.""He added: ""We hope the government will take action on this as a matter of priority, and ensure that the childcare support it has promised to parents is actually accessible.""Labour's shadow early years minister, Tracy Brabin, said the figures were the latest sign ""that the Tories are completely failing to deliver the affordable childcare that parents were promised"". ""The rollout of tax-free childcare has been a total shambles, with the government missing their own target by over 90%,"" she said.""The expanded scheme has been delayed time and time again, with an under-spend of nearly £1bn taken out of childcare entirely and returned to the Treasury.""Ms Truss said the root of the problem was a complex interaction between the three organisations delivering the web-based service: HMRC, computer company Atos and NS& I (national savings).She added that 12,000 manual codes had been issued - over the telephone rather than automatically via the website. HMRC head of transformation Nick Lodge said: ""The vast majority of people have been able to use the digital service. ""I apologise on behalf of HMRC and others for those problems, people had a right to expect a better service.""We've made significant improvements to the service since the summer.""It doesn't mean there are no parents with remaining difficulties to sort out.""There are, and we are getting through [the difficulties], having addressed the main IT issues that people had in the summer."""
2018-02-01,Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict,https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42885986,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWith Theresa May in China, stand-ins David Lidington and Emily Thornberry clashed at Prime Minister's Questions. What happened?David Lidington may not exactly be a household name but it is not the first time he has stood in for Theresa May. Emily Thornberry wasted no time in reminding of one of his earlier appearances, in December 2016, when the then justice secretary goaded Labour over its poor opinion poll ratings and in-fighting.""Well, what a difference a year makes,"" cried the shadow foreign secretary.She asked about increasing the number of women MPs - on the centenary of votes for women - before launching into the first of five questions about lowering the voting age to 16.This was a rare outing on the big stage for an issue that Labour has been campaigning on for a while. Mr Lidington was having none of it, insisting that voting came with the ""rights and responsibilities"" of age and few other countries had votes at 16.He also sent fact checkers into a spin by claiming 97 members of the Labour front bench have either been sacked or resigned since Jeremy Corbyn took over as leader.Mr Lidington hit back at Ms Thornberry's claim that 16-year-olds, who could join the forces, start a family and leave home, deserved to have a say in the running of the country, with a list of all the things Labour stopped them from doing when they were in power.Labour raised the age for buying cigarettes, fireworks, knives and even using sunbeds to 18, he said, hardly consistent, he suggested with reducing the voting age to 16.Speaker John Bercow came to Ms Thornberry's aid by telling the ""noisy, boorish and in one case rather stupid"" MPs, who he claimed always made more noise ""when a woman is addressing the house"", to shut up.Ms Thornberry suggested 16 and 17-year-old carers, who have ""given up their youth"", should not be denied a say at the ballot box - and cited the lower voting age in Scotland and Wales.We then came to the possible reason why she had chosen this subject - a past quote from Mr Lidington at the Youth Parliament, which appeared to suggest he supported lowering the voting age.Ms Thornberry's jibe about the DUP and the Tories being a ""coalition of cavemen"" raised a few laughs but did not appear to phase Mr Lidington, who hit back with a crack about the Flintstones. (No shouts of ""yabba dabba doo"" though.)Young people could take an interest in current affairs and when the time was right - 18 - they could take part in elections, he told MPs, just like they did in 26 of the 27 other members of the EU. He ended by advising Ms Thornberry to ""grow up"".The SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford brought up the leaked government document suggesting the UK would be worse off if it left the EU single market, claiming the government was ""in crisis"" over Brexit. (He also managed to squeeze in a reference to the Robin which had been flapping around the chamber before PMQs, bringing a bit of light relief to Welsh questions) Mr Lidington, who campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum, gave a rote response about the UK officially leaving the single market on Brexit day, before taking a swipe at the SNP, saying the ""most important single market to the people of Scotland is the single market of the United Kingdom"".Labour's David Lammy asked about cuts to the police and border force.Labour's John Mann asked about North/South funding discrepancies.Here is what Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil made of it:And here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's verdict:A relatively brisk 42 minutes of PMQs today - perhaps because, with neither Theresa May nor Jeremy Corbyn taking part, there was less cacophony and the Speaker had to spend less time quelling noisy MPs. So what did we learn?Emily Thornberry's questioning on women's representation in the Commons and on votes for 16 year-olds was a smart choice both in electoral and in internal party terms. And while David Lidington produced an adroit, effective, response, she will, doubtless, feel it's ""job done"".David Lidington is a long-serving, senior minister, with nothing to prove. Emily Thornberry has points to score and potential allies to win over. Both performers gave full rein to their inner luvvie, with some entertaining theatrics, but somehow it's just never as real as when the two leaders do battle.The backbench questioners caught the mood as well; most of the questions were either carefully ""helpful"" to their particular party, or raised constituency concerns. No-one on the backbenches sought to embarrass, or even pressure, the two stand-ins. There was a ritual exchange of courtesies and assurances between Mr Lidington and the DUP's Leader, Nigel Dodds, protecting the Commons pact which is the Government's delicate jugular vein, and there were signs that the SNP's Ian Blackford has begun to get the hang of PMQs, with a well-honed question on Brexit and the Single Market.Probably the nastiest moment came when Speaker Bercow complained of ""boorish and in one case rather stupid"" heckling. I'm not sure, from my viewpoint, who his target was - but I'm sure the MP in question will be smarting. But the Speaker is too secure on his Chair to worry about bruised backbench bruisers."

His antipathy to the Brexit project has been well advertised in the London Evening Standard newspaper which he edits.His hostility to Mrs May is also scarcely a secret since he's known to have privately aired a grisly wish to see the prime minister chopped into pieces and placed in his freezer. One assumes he was speaking figuratively.But it's also true that Mr Osborne is still extraordinarily well connected with his former colleagues, and frequently prints what Tory sceptics and opponents of Brexit are saying privately.In this case, it was to point out that the balance of opinion in both Houses of Parliament is broadly sympathetic to the Chancellor Philip Hammond's desire to keep Britain's future relationship with the EU as close to the terms of the customs union and European single market as possible.Also that like-minded MPs and peers in all parties have the voting strength to block a sharp break in the relationship after Brexit, if they choose to defy the wrath of Brexiteer colleagues and voters and use those votes. What's more immediately worrying for Theresa May is that while former ""Remainers"" among Tory MPs like to point out the Brexiteers make more noise, and more often bare their teeth at her, those Remainers too can now be heard saying the lack of direction on Brexit is becoming unsustainableMinisterial assurances that Britain will somehow achieve its ambition of a seamless transition to ""frictionless"" trade with the EU after Brexit (despite the repeated warnings from EU leaders that this is not possible) are no longer cutting it.Conservative MPs in the Remain stronghold of London are muttering about the danger of the Tories taking a retributive pasting in May's local elections, and the inevitable backlash among sitting MPs, candidates and defeated councillors.Meanwhile, Mrs May and her team have, understandably, stepped up their efforts to keep their fingers on the pulse of their Brexiteer colleagues. This week the Brexiteers met the government chief whip at number nine Downing Street.Worries were expressed about the Brexit transition. I'm told there were demands, more in hope than expectation, for the scalp of the UK's lead civil service negotiator Olly Robbins, who is seen by Brexiteers as a likely source of unwanted compromise.These clear-the-air meetings are to be convened more frequently in future.The prime minister's words on the status of EU migrants in Britain during a Brexit transition were a reassertion of the government's wish to form an immigration policy which has yet to take shape in any significant detail.Her words were plainly delivered with a nervous glance in the direction of potentially militant Brexiteers. Given their potential to rock the Tory boat, and even help tip the prime minister over the side, this seems political common sense.But it won't restore calm, or answer nagging questions on all sides.Even allowing for the fact that the end destination of Brexit can only emerge in the give-and-take of negotiations which have barely begun, the desired outcome for Mrs May is still largely a mystery.Any detailed and decisive shift in policy away from, or close to, the status quo could easily provoke a fatal confrontation with either Brexiteers or Remainers, and conceivably with both.Most Tory MPs still hope and pray that calm can, somehow, be restored. ""Trouble-makers"" are criticised for speaking out and ""making things worse"".Brexiteers tend to point the finger of blame at the Remainers, who do the opposite. The mood at last night's private meeting of backbench MPs, the 1922 Committee, was a plaintive collective appeal to ""keep calm and carry on"".But with no majority in the Commons, the government is vulnerable on any issue, and Brexit above all. The power of rival factions is magnified. The danger to Mrs May should Brexit unravel, or the party suffer some unforeseen crisis, is real. The pressure for May to ""give a lead"" is easy to understand and will likely increase. The painful reality confronting the prime minister as she contemplates those demands, and considers how to respond to them and keep hold of her job, is that on the issue of Brexit her party may have become unleadable."

It's a phrase much loved by football managers facing the sack but politicians have used it a lot too, with decidedly mixed results.Perhaps the most famous non-quitter of them all. In 2001, New Labour's ""prince of darkness"" was seething with indignation at twice being ejected from Tony Blair's cabinet.It all came boiling over in one extraordinary moment at his general election count.""It was said that I was facing political ruin,"" said the newly re-elected Hartlepool MP, his voice straining with emotion.""My career in tatters, apparently never to be part of the political living again.""Dramatic pause.""Well, they underestimated Hartlepool. And they underestimated me. Because I am fighter and not a quitter!""Mandelson's jaw-jutting, eyes-blazing cry of defiance drew ridicule from some but it worked like a charm.He did quit as an MP two years later - but only so he could be rehabilitated as a European Commissioner, and then, in one of the biggest comebacks in UK political history, as Gordon Brown's second-in-command and a member of the House of Lords. Others have had less luck with the phrase...IDS may hold the record for the shortest period between saying ""I'm not a quitter"" and quitting. The then Tory leader told his critics exactly what sort of character they were dealing with on the morning of 29 October 2003. ""I'm not a quitter,"" he declared ahead of a confidence vote by his MPs. By 7pm he was gone.The disgraced US president first uttered the phrase in a speech in 1952, when he denied accusations he had abused a political expenses fund, in a groundbreaking televised address. It worked - and he was able to keep his place as Eisenhower's running mate.He reached for it again 22 years later in another televised speech, announcing his resignation as president over the Watergate scandal.""I've never been a quitter,"" he told the American people, before proving himself wrong.""George is not a quitter. Nobody is going to back him into a corner,"" Mr Osborne's constituency agent told the Daily Mirror on the Sunday after the EU referendum.Theresa May didn't seem overly concerned about Mr Osborne's proud non-quitter status, however, and promptly fired him as chancellor. He stood down as Tatton MP 10 months after that.""Brits don't quit - we get involved, we take a lead, we make a difference, we get things done,"" said David Cameron in the run-up to June 2016's EU referendum.But he turned out to be one Brit who did quit - on the morning after losing the referendum, despite earlier insisting that he would stay in office whatever the result. Mr Brown never uttered the immortal phrase. But he had it thrown at him by his great political friend Tony Blair, who according to a book by Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, thought Mr Brown would stand down before the 2010 general election because ""history showed Mr Brown to be a quitter not a fighter"". This sly reference to Peter Mandelson's dramatic show of defiance prompted a furious round of denials from Mr Brown.""When you've set off on a journey, you have got to complete that journey,"" he said. His particular journey ended with defeat at the 2010 general election."
2018-02-01,'Auntie May',https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42889684,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowChinese state media are rolling out the red carpet for British Prime Minister Theresa May as she embarks on a three-day trade mission.Outlets have nicknamed her ""Auntie May"" - an affectionate form of lingo that is usually reserved for key allies of Beijing.State media say the visit shows Sino-UK relations are moving in a positive direction, and they are optimistic about future trade relations and cultural exchanges.  Mrs May will hold trade and investment talks with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. She is currently in Beijing after a short stopover in the central city of Wuhan, and she will also go to the economic powerhouse of Shanghai.Many of China's influential newspapers are giving prominent coverage to the visit.Reference News, which has a huge distribution in China, carries the headline: ""British Prime Minister visits China to boost the 'Golden Era'.""The phrase ""Golden Era"" was coined during President Xi's first state visit to the UK in October 2015, when David Cameron was prime minister. It has been used repeatedly by Prime Minister May and President Xi to emphasise that bilateral relations have gone from strength to strength.China can benefit from increased trade once Britain leaves the EU, says the English-language edition of state-run newspaper Global Times on its front page. It carries the headline: ""May eyes China after Brexit"", and says her trip indicates that Beijing ""will become increasingly important in post-Brexit Europe"".State media tend to use formal language when reporting on foreign dignitaries, so it is notable that they are using the affectionate term ""Auntie May"" when referring to Mrs May. China Plus, a state-run English-language website, says the moniker has been coined ""by the younger generation who are fond of British culture"". But given that the family unit is venerated in Chinese society, the use of the word ""auntie"" suggests that Beijing holds Mrs May in great respect.Official news agency Xinhua lauds ""Auntie May's arrival"" on its social media accounts, and state broadcaster CCTV similarly welcomes the arrival of ""Auntie May"". A China Plus video has been widely shared on leading social media platform Sina Weibo. It shows students explaining why they are fans of ""Auntie May"".One of them praises her for not being ""a stereotype of a female politician"", and for ""having a good sense of fashion"", adding ""she loves leopard print!""Another says she has made ""great efforts"" to tackle terrorism and deal with Brexit.Although Mrs May has visited China before, media have been eagerly anticipating the appearance in the mainland of ""The First Gentleman"", with CCTV noting this is the first time Philip May has accompanied the prime minister on a trip to China.The Xinhua News Agency says ""like most female leaders' spouses, the 'First Gentleman' is known for his modesty,"" and popular news website The Paper notes that he is ""very low-key, stays away from the media and the public eye"". Both outlets have written extensive biographies on Philip May, and laud the support he provides to his wife. A 31 January article says it is ""unfortunate"" that the two were unable to have children, but says ""What is most important is that for 40 years he has been by her side, loved her, supported her and defended her."" The Paper describes how their first meeting at a ball was ""love at first sight"" and says ""the support he gives to his wife will make her 'the next Margaret Thatcher'."" Users of the popular Sina Weibo microblog comment that he is ""a very handsome gentleman"" and that their relationship is ""really beautiful"".  Chinese social media users are commenting with warmth about Mrs May's visit. During her visit to Wuhan, Weibo users enthused over her visit to the landmark Yellow Crane Tower and Wuhan University, and her experiencing traditional Beijing Opera. Many also said that they hoped she would get to experience traditional ""Reganmian"", a spicy noodle dish that Wuhan is famous for. Users in Beijing and Shanghai say that they look forward to warmly welcoming ""Auntie May"" to their cities.But some are looking ahead to Mrs May's meeting with President Xi, and saying that hope discussions about Hong Kong will come up.Theresa May has pledged to raise Hong Kong and human rights with President Xi, but some mainland-based Weibo users say they hope she will ""make clear"" her views on democracy in Hong Kong.One says they hope she will ""publicly denounce Hong Kong separatists"".But another says that if she raises the subject, she should ""turn around and go to Hong Kong,"" rather than continue her visit.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Migration Watch's estimate is based on previous numbers of EU workers applying for National Insurance numbers in the UK, which included many people who travelled to the UK for short-term work and have now left the country. On the other hand, they exclude non-working dependants. Alp Mehmet, from Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for controls on migration, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday morning that allowing people arriving from the EU during the transition period the right to stay indefinitely and bring their dependents ""potentially means a million people"" having such rights.He based that on figures for the numbers of EU nationals applying for National Insurance numbers, which he said had been roughly half a million a year in recent years (and transition is expected to last about two years).The government and the EU are negotiating what happens during the transition period. And Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated she will fight a proposal to give residency rights to EU citizens during the period after Brexit.Everybody needs a National Insurance number (Nino) to work in the UK. The most recent figure from the Department for Work and Pensions was for NI numbers allocated in the year to the end of September 2017, when the number was 548,000, and it had indeed been above half a million for at least the three years before then.But those figures were considerably higher than the migration statistics from the Office for National Statistics, the most recent year of which showed 230,000 people arriving from the EU and a net figure (after subtracting people leaving) of 107,000.The migration statistics count people arriving in the country who plan to stay for at least a year, and those who have been in the country for at least a year and leave.There was much discussion in 2016 of why there were so many more EU nationals getting National Insurance numbers than had been arriving in the UK.The ONS looked into it and said the difference was due to short-term migrants. The migration figures cover people planning to stay for at least a year, whereas people applying for a National Insurance number could stay for shorter periods.One of the people questioning the size of the difference between the two figures was Prof Jonathan Portes, from King's College, London, who thinks more work is needed into why the discrepancy exists, especially because the migration figures have been falling faster than the National Insurance numbers.On the other hand, the National Insurance number figures cover only migrants wanting to work - their non-working dependants would be included in the ONS migration figures but not in the National Insurance figures.The key problem with the National Insurance figures is they include people who have worked for a short time and then left - in order to qualify for ""settled"" status under the current plans they would need to be in the country for five years. The proposal for settled status, outlined in the joint negotiated report between the EU and the UK, is that EU nationals who have been in the UK for five years (starting before the UK leaves the EU) will be eligible for the status, giving them indefinite leave to remain with the same access to public services as they have now.BBC Radio 4's Today programme presenter Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Mr Mehmet, countered the Nino figures with a figure of net migration from EU countries of about 9,000 a quarter.The ONS generally publishes the migration statistics as annual figures, but this quarterly one came from an ad hoc request and is for April to June 2017. The figure that is normally quoted is that for the year to the end of June, which was 107,000.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Forecasts should not be used as a prediction of a precise end point.No one should suggest - politician or otherwise - that any model reveals what will definitely happen.Governments and central banks can change policies, for example, to try and prevent forecasted outcomes.And Brexit is not the only factor governing our economic future.Rather, they are the central finding of a range of scenarios allowing a sensible judgement to be made about a future direction of travel.Imagine you had two dice, and you threw them onto a table.A sensible forecast about the most likely range of numbers the two dice would add up to would be 6, 7 or 8.Those are the numbers with the highest probability of appearing - throwing a 7 (which could come via 6+1; 1 +6; 5+2; 2+5; 3+4; 4+3) is much more likely than throwing a 12 (6+6).If you then throw an 11 (5+6 or 6+5), the forecast would still be reasonable - even though one of the outlying scenarios had come to pass.But it is also true that we haven't been throwing a series of predictable sevens.As ever with strong forecasts, many of the central scenarios have come to pass.And some haven't.   The forecast for the UK economy following the Brexit vote suggested that growth would slow, the value of sterling would fall and inflation (prices) would rise, leading to a fresh incomes squeeze.Those forecasts have been borne out by events.The rest of Europe has been growing more strongly than the UK.Of course, not all that is down to Brexit.But it is reasonable to assume some of it is, given that the UK was top of the growth charts two years ago and the referendum is the one, substantive change.And, as Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, said in his interview on the Today programme last week that means tens of billions of pounds of economic activity isn't happening that could have been expected to be happening if Britain had decided not to leave the EU.Other parts of the forecasts have not come to pass.Unemployment has not soared.Consumer confidence has not collapsed.And there has been little sign of a recession.Why? Because forecasts are not built to include all the ""dynamic effects"" of changing circumstances.After the referendum, the Bank of England cut interest rates and increased its levels of asset purchases (quantitative easing).This monetary stimulus acted as a shock absorber.The fall in the value of sterling was also an economic stimulus, making our exports more competitive.And the government also loosened the public spending purse strings in the Autumn Statement that followed the referendum, providing a fiscal boost.The fact is, economic forecasts are negative because of the trade impact of leaving a single market and customs union with our biggest trading partner.But, other effects can mitigate those downside risks - such as, over time, signing trade deals with other countries.The UK economy has performed better than some predicted.Better global growth has helped, alongside that monetary and fiscal stimulus.And, of course, we haven't left the EU yet.Forecasts are just that - a range of the likely scenarios given the wide range of data and statistical analysis now possible about economic relations around the world and their effects on economic performance.But they are not set in stone. And that is where politicians come in: they can change the forecasting weather."

You don't know how to process your grief. All through your 43 years on Earth so far you've always tried to be tough. You don't cry at the funeral. You want to be strong for your sisters. You want to just get on with it. But the depression creeps up and up on you.It's just you and your dad in the house now. You've become his full-time carer - there's no-one else left to look after him now mum is gone. Anything he needs, you do it for him. His cancer spreads from his lungs to his other organs until, inevitably, it kills him.Two parents gone within two years. And now you're alone in the house.The council says you have to move to a flat, so you pack up and go. You like it. Decent size, first floor, communal gardens, nice neighbours. It needs doing up but you aren't afraid of putting a bit of work in.You want to go back to work again so you go door-to-door selling Avon products. You start to notice your neck feels stiff. Your back, too. Must be from all that physical labour over the years. Plus a couple of road accidents you had when you were younger. Once a driver did a U-turn in front of you when you were on your motorbike. Your knees hit the car first then you went over the roof and landed on your head. Years ago, this was.There's this bloke you get to know. Friend of a friend. You fetch his paper every morning. Sometimes he cooks for you in return. One day he invites you in for a drink. You go indoors and take a seat. There's another fella there. You accept a drink from the friend of a friend. He's been drinking already. Then he starts getting a bit loud, so you ask him to keep it down.He doesn't like that. Comes over and hits you. You're still in your chair. You get up and have a pop in retaliation, then the other fella separates you. There's an unopened packet of knives in the room. You see it happening in slow motion. The friend of a friend selects a knife from the packet. You don't think he's going to use it, but then he does. He stabs you in the thigh. You try to grab the knife to defend yourself. You get cut again in your arm and around your eye.Right, you say. I'm getting out of here. You turn to leg it. ""Don't tell anyone about this,"" he says, and then he sticks the knife in your shoulder blade. That's the worst one. You thought this bloke was all right. You thought he was your mate. You got that wrong. You go to hospital. They fix you up and send you home but the pain is still bad. Your back and your neck. What's worse, you can't stop thinking about the attack. Reliving it over and over. Lying awake.The friend of a friend is jailed for the stabbing but that doesn't stop your paranoia. You walk down the road looking at every single car that passes, every motorbike. They might be coming for you. You see a pizza delivery bloke. He's looking for an address. You think he might be a hitman coming after you. He stops and looks at you. You think you're going to be attacked again. You don't trust anyone.You used to be really fit. Cycled all the time. Now you can't. And you love your cycling. All your muscles lock up. Every time you wake up in the morning, you're aching.You go to your GP. He examines you and signs you off work for six months. He says you have post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. There's no way you can work. You're also diagnosed with muscular arthritis. That, plus the scars from the knife attack, means it's painful to turn your neck or lift your arms above shoulder height.You're on something called Employment Support Allowance. ESA. Minimum-level state benefits, that means. It's for people who can't work because of ill health or disability. You get housing benefit as well, which goes straight to the council to pay for the flat.Then a few weeks later the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) calls you in.It's a work capability assessment, they say. There's a form to fill in first about what you can and can't do. Can you pick up a £1 coin?  Can you raise a hand to your head? Well, just about, though it's painful. You go along and the person assessing you says you're fit for work. You say you're not. Your GP agrees that you're not. But the assessor's opinion outweighs any other. Your benefits are stopped - both the ESA and the housing benefit. You've got no money coming in. Nothing. You're falling in arrears with your rent. Friends are feeding you. You go to your local food bank. It's embarrassing. You don't like it. But the one round the corner isn't too bad. They don't ask any questions. You just go there and get your stuff. You push your bike, the bike you can't ride any more. They give you pasta, potatoes, tins of soup, couscous - you don't like the couscous much but you take it anyway, it's not like you can afford to be choosy. Then you hang the shopping bags on the bike and push it home in the rain.You're losing weight because of the lack of food. You're still in pain. You're still depressed. You used to be really outgoing. You liked talking to people and going out and doing stuff but now you're just not in the mood. The council apply for a possession order of your flat. They go to court and get one, suspended. They won't take the flat off you if you can make payments towards the arrears - £300 a month.You keep going back to the Job Centre and asking if they can do anything for you. And finally - after seven months with no money coming in whatsoever, the DWP tells you that you can go on a new benefit called Universal Credit - the part of it that replaces Jobseeker's Allowance. They told you before you weren't eligible, but apparently now you are. You don't understand what's changed. There's no explanation. It seems as though there's been a mistake somewhere.Now you get £414.33 for your rent and £317.82 for living costs. It's different from the benefits you were on before. Before, the Housing Benefit was paid direct to the council for your rent. Now, you get the housing costs and the living costs paid directly to you in one lump sum - one of the features of Universal Credit introduced by your local MP, Iain Duncan Smith.Except you don't realise this - that the money is no longer going direct to the council and you need to sort it out yourself. No-one explained it to you, not in a way you understood, at least. You end up going even further into arrears with the rent. What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem?Because you've been assessed fit for work, you're supposed to spend 35 hours a week looking for a job. But when the DWP summon you to a jobseeker's meeting to ask what you're doing to find work, you don't get the message. No-one tells you. There's no letter - not one that reaches you, anyway. It could be that they've sent you the message electronically - but you're no good with computers. You don't have one at home and the sole time you tried to use one down the Job Centre you didn't know what half the keys did. So because you don't turn up to the jobseeker's meeting, you get what is called a sanction - that means they stop the £317.82 for monthly living costs.You know nothing about this. You don't actually work out that you've been sanctioned for 212 days. You just know there is less money coming in. All you have to live on is the £414.33 that's supposed to be for housing costs. But you're still paying the council £300 a month for the earlier rent arrears - which means you are left with £114.33 a month to subsist on. That's £26.38 a week.You can't survive on that. And, once again, you can't pay the rent.You're back to relying on food banks and donations from friends. You take the bracelet you wear around your wrist to the pawnbroker.It's still not enough.It seems that every time you go to the Job Centre, someone gives you a different story about what you should be doing. You try to phone the DWP to sort things out, but no-one seems able to help you there, either. Each phone call costs you something like £8 - the claimant helpline is premium rate from mobiles and you haven't got a landline. Your rent arrears are now in excess of £10,000.The council seeks a court order for your eviction. You're looking at spending Christmas on the streets.You go to see a legal adviser. You haven't been able to see a lawyer until now, because benefits law isn't covered by legal aid any more, but some housing law is.Your lawyer and a Citizens Advice caseworker can't make head nor tail of what's going on at first. Eventually, they work out that you've been sanctioned. They write to the Universal Credit department repeatedly to ask for an explanation - it takes a long time for them to figure out why you have been sanctioned and what you could do to get the sanction lifted. But first you have to go to court to try and avoid eviction.Your legal adviser is a man called Simon Mullings. He tells you how serious the situation is. He's not going to sugar-coat it for you. The council are trying to be reasonable, he says, but they have a statutory duty to recover the lost rent. If you lose this case you'll be homeless.You sit through three very scary hearings as your legal team argues your case.You have a barrister, Mary-Rachel McCabe. She tells your whole Kafkaesque story to the judge.""Tony has been failed by a malfunctioning system,"" she says. ""From the moment Tony claimed Universal Credit last year, he suffered the consequences of its arbitrary rules and procedures, and so was immediately plunged into further rent arrears and other debt.""The judge is visibly shocked. The system is ""appalling"", she says.McCabe tells the court that the sanction and the finding that you are fit for work are now being challenged with the help of a benefits adviser from Citizens Advice.If that's successful it will give you an extra £317.82 a month and allow you to pay your rent. A new court hearing is set for May. That's a reprieve. If you can show a pattern of payment by then, maybe you won't be evicted.Mullings, your legal advisor, tells you it might not feel like it, but you're one of the lucky ones. At least because this was a housing case you had legal representation. If you hadn't, you would have been steamrollered. The court you've been going to, Edmonton County Court, has seen lots of similar Universal Credit cases, Mullings says. Other courts that he works in nearby - Stratford, Romford - they're not seeing these cases yet, because Universal Credit hasn't been rolled out into those areas. ""But they're coming down the line,"" says Mullings. ""So this is the vanguard of a tsunami of Universal Credit problems. Unless the government radically changes tack.""For you, though, things are looking up. It's still a struggle but it's getting a bit better. You feel like you can't move on while this is hanging over you. You want to get stronger. Like you used to be. Nothing ever used to get you down. ""I've always tried my best, even though my body really hurts,"" you say. ""I just keep going, I'm like that. But the pressure - I can't think straight, I can't concentrate on one thing any more. I think about nothing but my problems.""A friend asks if you've seen a film called I, Daniel Blake. It's about a man caught up in the nightmare bureaucracy of the benefits system. You haven't had time to watch it. But you say you should play the lead in the sequel.Your name is Tony Rice, and you're not going to let this break you. Follow Jon Kelly on Twitter @mrjonkellyA DWP spokesperson said: ""There is a range of extra support we can offer people to help them manage their money, including direct payments to their landlords, emergency payments and budgeting advice.""We encourage people to engage with this support and talk to their work coach if they are experiencing financial difficulties.""Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter."
2018-02-01,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-01,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180201161020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

What is most striking is that some who supported her have, at the very least, become wobblier. One ex-minister said he felt ""badly let down"". She has been accused of blocking, not delivering, radical change.A former supporter questioned her lack of decisiveness: ""She has more reviews than a film critic would produce in a lifetime.""A Remainer who despises Boris Johnson wondered if - to coin a phrase - the foreign secretary's ""bad leadership would be better than no leadership"". Council candidates fear poor results in London's May elections and think this could be a trigger for the PM to go. And a Conservative-supporting business leader felt - though he didn't advocate it - that her opponents ""will pull the pin from the grenade"". Downing Street believes the feeding frenzy of speculation will abate when more progress is made on EU withdrawal. But they are aware of the challenges at home as well as abroad.The prime minister has come under pressure from Eurosceptics worried about potential concessions by the UK in the Brexit talks.Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested Britain's relationship with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit.However, cabinet members - including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - have warned the UK will lose the main advantages of Brexit if it remains bound by trade rules of the single market and customs union.They have called for the prime minister to be clearer about her own position.Mrs May has repeatedly said Brexit will mean leaving the single market and customs union. She told the BBC her goal in upcoming talks with Europe was to strike a deal that ""is going to be good for trade between the UK and EU and good for jobs in Britain"".She added: ""It means a free trade agreement with the EU. We are now starting to negotiate that free trade agreement with the EU. ""We want that to enable trade to take place on as frictionless and tariff-free a basis as possible across our borders, but we also want to be signing trade deals in the rest of the world, like here in China.""Asked again about her own future as prime minister, Mrs May said ""throughout my political career I've served my country and I've served my party"".""I'm not a quitter. I'm in this because there is a job to be done here and that's delivering for the British people and doing that in a way that ensures the future prosperity of our country."""
2018-02-02,Haringey Momentum policies revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42920547,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe London borough of Haringey looks set be one of the first places in the UK where the kind of socialist policies advocated by Jeremy Corbyn-support group Momentum could be put into action. What can residents expect? Haringey Labour Party has recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons - de-selections, division, denunciations.But soon it may come under scrutiny more for policies than its internal processes.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn say it will become the first Momentum council after May's local elections.Momentum is, of course, the left-wing campaign group set up after Mr Corbyn's initial victory as Labour leader to keep the spirit and politics of his campaign alive.If Labour - as is expected - wins in Haringey in 3 May's local elections, it's unlikely that the majority of councillors will be fully paid-up members of Momentum.But the group's representation will go up, its influence will increase and the council will move to the left  - and Momentum know that, in effect, they will be held responsible for its actions.The first stage in agreeing a manifesto for the local council elections will take place on Sunday, when about 300 Labour members will meet for a policy discussion.The BBC has seen ideas Momentum and allies on the party's left will be putting forward.They believe that local government manifestos should be at least as radical as those contained in Labour's 2017 general election manifesto.And that there should be a break from the past.So, while the outgoing Labour council wanted a 50/50 partnership with the private sector to redevelop a large council estate, the meeting on Sunday will discuss scrapping this and replacing it with an entirely council-run scheme.Beyond that, they are advocating radical ideas to underpin their anti-austerity agenda, including:In addition, Haringey could follow the example of other left-led councils such as Salford, which has given care workers a 10% pay increase, despite overall budget cuts.Sources say some of the previous speculation about what might be in Labour's manifesto - such as capping council salaries above £60,000 - is inaccurate. This idea has already been rejected, and never had widespread support.The hope on Labour's left is that they can turn the scrutiny on Haringey to their advantage and provide inspiration to other Labour councils. But at this stage none of the ideas appear to have costings attached.  And that scrutiny may blunt the party's cutting-edge ideas. One way of paying for council tax exemptions would be, for example, significantly hiking the levy on those who do pay - but I understand that there is an aversion to doing so in case the council gets quickly defined more for tax raising than redistribution.The potential policy programme did not impress Nora Mulready. She used to work for local MP David Lammy but has been highly critical of Momentum's growing influence in the borough and the removal of some sitting councillors. She resigned form Labour at the weekend and told the BBC: ""There is a battle for the political soul of the Labour Party between pragmatic people who will use any tools available to alleviate poverty - and those who place an antipathy to the private sector above the needs of people. ""Momentum activists at some point are going to come in to contact with reality and that will dramatically change what they are suggesting can happen.""But Labour MP Chris Williamson - a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn - hailed the discussions on the party's future direction, saying: ""We have a Labour Party that is  mass movement - some of the ideas the members in Haringey are looking at is a great exercise in democracy."" And he backed the ending of outsourcing, telling the BBC's Daily Politics: ""Most people don't like the fact that the private sector is essentially ripping-off the public purse.""Surely (it would) be better to have things delivered in-house - dividends dished out to shareholders would not be necessary and those profits could be reinvested and improve services.""However, the final local election manifesto that emerges in Haringey may not be quite as radical as envisaged. Ultimately, whatever the grassroots think, the current Labour group has to sign it off - and a majority of them oppose Momentum.  Although about a third of the current group of Labour councillors will be standing down - or have been deselected by a more left-wing membership - they may still be able to delete policies they don't like before they leave office.  But there is a widespread acceptance that the controversial public/private housing project will be an early casualty of the council's move to the left. "

Labour had claimed Mr Nuttall's use of an empty house as his address raised questions about his fitness for public office.However, UKIP said Mr Nuttall had stayed overnight and was using it as a base while campaigning.The Electoral Commission's guidance for candidates and agents states home addresses ""must be completed in full"" and ""must be your current home address"" but ""does not need to be in the constituency in which you intend to stand"".Staffordshire Police said ""considerable media interest"" in the allegations had prompted an investigation.Mr Nuttall stepped down from the party in June 2017 after its performance in the general election."

However, we strongly condemn the actions of protesters who disrupted normal debate and behaved in this way.""There is no place for such action on a university campus or in a civilised society.""It was due to be a fairly routine event - Jacob Rees-Mogg was booked to speak to a few hundred students at a ticketed event.He would've spoken for about half an hour before taking questions.Just a few minutes after he started speaking, a group of protestors came into the back of the lecture theatre and started shouting anti-Conservative rhetoric, very loudly, trying to shout him down.Rather than halting the event, or ignoring them, Mr Rees-Mogg walked up to the back of the theatre to try and talk them down.At that point, various other members of the audience got involved, leading to the scuffle which happened. It looked to me that Mr Rees-Mogg was actually pushed and shoved, although he insists he wasn't.But it was a very aggressive and unexpected scene.After the scuffle, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""Some people who don't agree with me wanted to make their point, and I don't object to this. ""I think we live in a free society and freedom of speech is very important. ""And people like me, who advocate freedom of speech, support it when it's not exactly what we want, as well as when it is what we want.""Universities Minister Sam Gyimah branded the protesters' behaviour ""thuggish"", adding: ""Free speech under the law is fundamental to our democracy.""He praised Mr Rees-Mogg for ""not being cowed into silence"".Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner condemned the behaviour of ""those who tried to attack"" the MP, branding their actions ""extremely intimidating"".Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Jo Swinson said it was ""deeply worrying to see violent tactics by political opponents"".A post on the society's Facebook page, advertising the event, said it would be a ""chance to talk to an experienced parliamentarian about the issues of the day, what it's like to be an MP and how you can get there"".On Twitter, eyewitness Chloe Kaye, who filmed the scuffle, described ""a huge amount"" of physical violence.Others condemned the protesters.Absolutely disgusting.

The emotionally charged exchanges came during debate on a bill to allow heterosexual couples to form civil partnerships, and for all stillborn deaths to be registered.Many MPs were seen wiping away tears as Mrs Hodgson admitted that although her experience happened almost 20 years ago, she still found it very difficult to talk about.Had her third child Lucy been born alive, she would have been incubated at 23.5 weeks, taken in an ambulance to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary's special care baby unit and ""had the very best world class care"", she said.""She would have a birth certificate. She would have been celebrating her 20th birthday this year. ""But sadly she was stillborn. So no flashing blue lights, no incubator and no birthday parties. Ever.""And I found out to my horror - no birth or death certificate. So as I held her in my arms and had to come to terms with that had just happened, I also then had to come to terms with the fact that unfortunately, she did not exist ...""She was three to four days short of the required 24 week legal age to be considered eligible for a death certificate.""Mrs Hodgson said she was ""further traumatised"" when she discovered Lucy's birth had been recorded as a miscarriage.""Because she was pre-24 weeks, she didn't even get the dignity of being classed as a stillbirth,"" she commented.The MP said Lucy was named at a blessing conducted by the hospital chaplain, and she was ""buried in a tiny white coffin"" in the same grave as her grandparents, A small family service was funded by the Co-op, and because her elder children were only two and three and a half years old at the time, only her husband and their parents were in attendance.""I tell you all this to highlight that to the chaplain, to the Co-op funeral service, to us - her family - she existed. She was a baby who was sadly born dead.""Her heart was beating throughout my labour just up to minutes before she was born - she just couldn't make the final push into this world.""And because of a matter of a few days, she doesn't officially exist in any records, other than in our memories and our own family records.""Even the entry on the deeds for the grave is in my name - as if I or in this case, a bit of me, was buried there.""Mrs Hodgson said she hoped MPs would understand how hard it had been to deal with what happened, which ""was and still is the worst thing I've had to experience in all my life"".Having seen the ""miracle"" of babies surviving birth before 24 weeks, she added: ""Surely there's a way to recognise a 22 or 23 week baby who didn't quite make it to their first birthday?""Mr Quince, who intervened during Mrs Hodgson's address to allow her to compose herself, said all bereaved parents ""want to ensure that our child's life, however short, has meaning"".""If you don't mind me saying, I think Lucy would be very proud of her mummy today,"" he added.Mrs Hodgson, smiled, thanked him and laughed: ""If you were trying to calm me down, you've probably made me worse.""Later in the debate, Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins told MPs the government would review the issue to see if the law needed to be changed to allow for the registration of pregnancy loss before 24 weeks gestation.""The Department of Health and Social Care recognises the need to do more to support families affected by a miscarriage,"" she said.""Some families may want their loss to be acknowledged and registered, others however may feel distressed at any mandatory requirement to do so in the circumstances of their grief, and so this issue must therefore be approached with great care and sensitivity.""Tory MP Tim Loughton's Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which calls for the formal registration of stillborn children, received an unopposed second reading on Friday."

Mrs May has said it should be up to individual MPs to decide whether to do so or not. During the 2016 Conservative leadership contest, she published details of her annual earnings between 2011-2 and 2014-5 and tax incurred on them over the period. She has not published any information since then. MPs are currently paid £76,011 a year and as MP for Islington North, Mr Corbyn is entitled to a London weighting allowance. His latest return shows he also earned £6,464 from his state pension, £2,404.53 from his Unison pension and £6 on interest from savings. An error in Mr Corbyn's tax code - which was spotted by his accountant - meant the Labour leader had to pay £6,179.80 in income tax in one go after the end of the tax year. The Labour leader first released his tax return - for 2014-5 - in April 2016 amid a row over the then prime minister David Cameron's family investments. The Labour leader's 2015-6 declaration, published in March 2017, sparked a short-lived row after it initially appeared not to show the money he was entitled to as leader of the opposition.It was soon clarified that the £27,192 sum had been listed after all under pensions and benefits in line with Revenue & Customs rules. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell also published his most recent tax return on Friday, revealing he paid £24,099.20 in tax on earnings of £87,353 last year."

Landowners, he said, should not make a huge profit from the planning system.The former minister, who has argued housing should be central to the Conservatives' domestic policy agenda if it hopes to keep Labour out of power at the next election, suggested the idea merited cross-party support.There are two ways of looking at a hung parliament. Either as a reason why you can't get anything done. Or as a reason to do things with cross-party support. Like this: https://t.co/vSALACUQOnEnd of Twitter post  by @NickBolesThe Twitter exchanges were prompted by reports in the Guardian suggesting Labour was considering obliging landowners to give up sites for a fraction of their current prices to help pay for new council homes.Land granted planning consent for new housing has a higher market value.This boost in value can be very profitable for developers, private landowners and firms which specialise in purchasing land for development on behalf of institutional investors before selling it on - often to councils.Labour is looking at changing the law in England to create a new sovereign land trust that would have the power to buy sites at closer to their pre-planning price.By increasing the supply of land available, a lack of which is regarded as one of the biggest obstacles to housebuilding, Labour says it could cut the cost of building 100,000 council houses a year by almost £10bn. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey told the newspaper that ""rather than letting private landowners benefit from this windfall gain and making everyone else pay for it, enabling public acquisition of land at nearer pre-planning permission value would mean cheaper land, which could help fund cheaper housing"".The idea led to a vigorous debate between Ms Truss, who is Chancellor Philip Hammond's number two at the Treasury and Mr Boles, a former skills minister who has accused Theresa May's government of timidity and called for radical new thinking from his party on how to pay for the NHS, social care and housing.This is deeply sinister. First the utility companies, then the landowners. Who next? #freedomerosion #confiscation https://t.co/V1EI4MWO8UEnd of Twitter post  by @trusslizUrging his colleague to ""read beyond the headline"", Mr Boles questioned why a few landowners should receive a ""windfall profit"" on land sales when the taxpayer ""bears the cost"" of additional infrastructure required to go alongside major developments, particularly in rural areas. When Ms Truss said she did not agree with ""state-decided prices"" being imposed on private companies and individuals, Mr Boles fired back that existing prices were not a product of market forces.""They are the product of artificial scarcity created by the nationalisation of development rights and the introduction of the planning system,"" he wrote, to which Ms Truss replied ""quite"". Last year's Conservative general election manifesto said the party would change compulsory purchase orders to make it easier for councils to acquire land by ""making it easier to determine the true market value of sites"". Landowners said they were willing to consider incremental changes to the current planning system - but the Country Land and Business Association said its members would oppose any plan to ""forcibly remove assets at artificial low prices"".Theresa May has vowed to spend extra £2bn for new council homes and affordable homes over the next four years as part of a ""national mission"" to provide more homes to rent at affordable prices.But critics say the promise of an extra 25,000 homes by 2021 was ""paltry"" and fell well short of what was needed to help the 1.2 million people waiting for council house accommodation.

2018-02-02,Mums' names to go on marriage certificate,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42919441,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters have backed calls for mothers' names to be put on marriage certificates in England and Wales.The Home Office said it will support a private member's bill, which aims to modernise marriage registration for the first time since 1837.If passed, it would allow the names of both parents of the couple to be included on marriage certificates - instead of just those of their fathers.Home Secretary Amber Rudd says the move will modernise an outdated system.MPs from all parties have spent several years attempting to bring about a change in the law to allow both parents to have their names and occupations recorded.Their campaign received the backing of former Prime Minister David Cameron, who pledged to address this ""inequality in marriage"" - but he was gone from Downing Street before any action could be taken.The move would bring England and Wales into line with the rest of the UK. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, couples are asked to give the names of both parents on marriage documentation. The same applies for those entering a civil partnership.On Friday, the Home Office said it would back Tory MP Tim Loughton's Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which also modernises the process of marriage registration away from a solely paper-based system.Ms Rudd said: ""A marriage is not just a major event for the couple but also in the life of any parent - and it is only right that all parents have the opportunity to have their names included on marriage certificates. ""The current legislation which only allows for fathers' names is completely outdated and does not reflect modern Britain.  ""There are around 250,000 marriages every year. It is about time that there are equal rights and recognition when it comes to registering a child's marriage."" The changes would mean that marriage entries - currently stored in 84,000 hard copy marriage registers - would be held in a single electronic register, which the Home Office says could result in savings of £33.8m over 10 years.Mr Loughton's bill also calls for heterosexual co-habiting partners to be allowed to form civil partnerships - in the same way as gay couples - a move the government has pledged to review.The MP said it was ""not fair"" that opposite sex couples have ""the single option of marriage"".Mr Loughton also urged the registration of stillbirths delivered before the required 24-week legal age to be considered viable. His bill received an unopposed second reading."

""I have apologised to Charles Grant who is an honest and trustworthy man. ""As I have put on record many times I have the highest regard for our hard-working civil servants.

I said the account that was put to me is correct.""It was put to me, I considered it an extraordinary allegation, I still consider it an extraordinary allegation.""Following Mr Baker's apology, Mr Rees-Mogg is continuing to insist that the Treasury has questions to answer over its stance on the customs union.3/5 When Mr. Grant refers to ‘unpublished papers’ on the Customs Union, who commissioned these and authorised him to be told?

2018-02-02,Call for straight couple civil partnerships,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42916294,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Tory MP has launched a bid to allow heterosexual couples in England and Wales to form civil partnerships in the same way as gay couples.Tim Loughton said it was ""not fair"" that opposite sex couples have ""the single option of marriage"".He also called for mothers' names to be included on marriage certificates and for all still births to be formally registered.The government is backing Mr Loughton's Private Members Bill.Home Secretary Amber Rudd said it was time both parents' names were included on marriage certificates. ""The current legislation which only allows for fathers' names is completely outdated and does not reflect modern Britain,"" she said.  The Home Office says it has been considering options for updating the marriage entry and working with stakeholders, including the Church of England and Church in Wales, to develop plans for this possible reform.But Mr Loughton has been forced to water down his proposals on civil partnerships - to promise a review of the current laws rather than a straightforward commitment to allow straight couples to form civil partnerships.This could result in equality being achieved by scrapping civil partnerships for everyone.But Mr Loughton is confident ministers will be persuaded to back his position after they have carried out their review.He said his Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill, which received an unopposed second reading, would ""correct an unintended, but glaring inequality"".Civil partnerships in England and Wales were introduced in 2004 as an initial step on the road to legalising gay marriage.Demand then fell after gay marriage was legalised in England and Wales in March 2014, and in Scotland in December 2014.But some straight couples who do not want a traditional marriage have argued there is now inequality in the law as they do not have the choice of a civil partnership.Mr Loughton argued that offering opposite sex couples the chance to form a civil partnership could improve family stability and give partners legal protection if either one of them dies.He said there are 3.2 million cohabiting opposite sex couples in England and Wales, but many shun traditional marriage because they view it as having establishment, religious and patriarchal connotations, as well as being ""rather expensive"".Many family law solicitors have written to the MP in support of his campaign ""because they see the fall out"" when partnerships breakdown.""We need to find new ways for the state to recognise committed relationships and give children stability,"" he said, adding that all that would be required to rectify the situation would be a one line amendment to the 2004 bill.There were just over a thousand civil partnerships formed in the UK in 2015, according to House of Commons library research. By contrast, between 29 March 2014 and 30 June 2015, there were 7,366 marriages formed between same sex couples in England and Wales.But Mr Loughton said the ""conversion rate"" of gay people in civil partnerships opting to get married was thought to be about 14%.Conservative MP Edward Leigh asked if co-habiting sisters could also be covered by the proposed legislation - but Mr Loughton rejected the call, saying it would make the measure ""even more complicated"".Labour shadow minister Karen Lee said her party fully supported Mr Loughton's bill, but argued that scrapping civil partnerships would be a ""step backwards"" for those that do not want to marry.The UK government has previously said it did not intend to consult further on the future of civil partnerships or to change the law after two reviews, but Mr Loughton's bill is set to herald a fresh look at the issue.A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are proud that we introduced marriage for same-sex couples and that they are finally able to celebrate their relationship in the way other couples have done for centuries.""It is right that we evaluate the demand for civil partnerships before we make changes to the law.""We continue to keep this under review and are assessing the demand for civil partnerships amongst both same-sex and opposite sex couples.""The issue made the headlines when a heterosexual couple who want to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married were granted the right to take their case to the Supreme Court, which is due to make a ruling on it mid-May.Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, from west London, argue the government's position is ""incompatible with equality law"" and there is still ""everything to fight for""."
2018-02-02,UKIP AM facing week's expulsion over slur,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42917281,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUKIP AM Michelle Brown is facing a week's exclusion from the assembly without pay over a racial slur she used to describe a Labour MP.Members of the standards committee, including party colleague Gareth Bennett, ruled she committed a ""severe breach"" of the code of conduct.Ms Brown made the comment about Chuka Umunna in a private phone call in 2016.A spokesman for Michelle Brown said she would appeal. She has apologised for any offence caused.The spokesman, alluding to occasions where Mr Bennett has drawn negative publicity, added: ""Michelle Brown is not likely to take any lessons at all on political correctness or conduct, from Gareth Bennett.""The recommendation of the standards committee, and the results of an investigation by the standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans that prompted it, have come to light after its report was leaked to BBC Wales.It will be up to assembly members to decide whether to endorse the exclusion in a vote in Senedd. It is thought to be the first case of its kind.Ms Brown called the MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna, a ""coconut"" in a phone call in May 2016 to her then senior adviser Nigel Williams, which he released a recording of to the Daily Post newspaper last summer.In his investigation the standards commissioner found that the term ""coconut"" fell below the standard of conduct required of AMs.He said the point that Ms Brown was making - that, despite Mr Umunna's heritage, his privilege upbringing meant he had no greater understanding of the lives of ordinary members of the black and minority ethnic community - was ""within the range of points that a politician is entitled to make"".But he said that fact remained that ""Ms Brown, in making her point, resorted to using a term of racial abuse"".Ms Brown had told the standards commissioner that the comments complained of ""were made during a private and personal conversation between two friends and party colleagues.""But the commissioner said that was ""not realistic"" as she had been discussing the terms of employment of a person whom she was considering employing.The committee agreed saying ""the term used in this instance was a term of racial abuse, and as such utterly unacceptable"", accusing her of bringing the assembly into disrepute.It said that the language is ""below the expectations of an assembly member and that racism has no place in society"", calling the use of the term a ""severe breach"" of the code of conduct for AMs which they said applies ""at all times"".According to the report, Ms Brown had argued that the term was ""not racist"".The UKIP North Wales AM told the commissioner that she did not apologise ""for using the verbal short-cut coconut"", and that there was no evidence the assembly had been brought into disrepute.Her words, she said, ""were recorded and released to the press without my consent and the motivation for the release was personal spite, not a desire to further the public good"".However the committee's report said that she later apologised for any offence her words may have caused, and an advisor to her also accepted that it was a term of racial abuse ""at the lowest level of severity"".Because the Labour group had made the initial complaint only three members of the four member committee - Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd, the Conservatives' Paul Davies and UKIP's Gareth Bennett - oversaw the deliberations, with Labour AM Jayne Bryant absenting herself.The committee said it would not expect to see complaints being made by party groups this way again as it has a ""detrimental impact on the process"".It was also concerned that information relating to the complaint by the chair of the Labour group was released to a newspaper at the point of submission to the standards commissioner.Ms Brown's spokesman said: ""Of course Michelle will be appealing as the committee have reached the wrong conclusion.""Under the rules, assembly members are given a period of 10 days from receiving a standard's committee decision to appeal to the presiding officer.Appeals are only considered on the grounds of significant factual inaccuracies, or procedural irregularities that may have prejudiced the member's right to a fair hearing.A UKIP Wales spokesman said: ""It would be improper to make a comment on an alleged leaked report."""

Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject. If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out. At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position  of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed. Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap. Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down. Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part. MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn. Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.    But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example. It is going to be a long time before the builders move in. First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done. Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures. In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable. We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.  The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall.  This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future. Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network. It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap. A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law. A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates.

2018-02-02,EU's thinking,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42922796,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth £625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy.  The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO.  There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet.For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March. "

Jeremy Corbyn!'.Glastonbury is having a year off to protect the site, so Labour bosses have decided to set up a festival of their own.The event - called Labour Live - will be held in North London and is expected to attract stars who have publicly supported the Labour leader, though it is expected that some new names will be added to the setlist.  In the 2017 election campaign acts such as Clean Bandit, Steve Coogan, Maxine Peak and Wolf Alice appeared at Corbyn rallies. This isn't the first time political parties have tried to engage youth support through festivals. Last year the Conservative MP, George Freeman, set up a Conservative 'Ideas Festival'.  The Tories seeking young votersAn invite-only event, it was billed as a cross between book festival Hay-on-Wye and rock festival Latitude and saw 200 people trekking to the farm in Berkshire to develop their centre-right political thoughts. The 'Big Tent Ideas Festival' is coming back this summer, and we're told it is going to be ""much bigger and much more public"". Organisers say we can expect to hear from centre-right political thinkers alongside more arts, music and poetry - the date and full rundown will be announced in March.And let's not forget that back in the mid-1980s, a group of musicians including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Kirsty MacColl set up Red Wedge to support the Labour Party and organised a number of major tours. Artists like Bananarama, Elvis Costello, Sade and The Smiths were involved and a comedy circuit was later set up with comedians such as Lenny Henry, Harry Enfield and Robbie Coltrane.  But when the Tories won a third consecutive victory in 1987 the grouping fell away. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We are exploring options for ways to continue to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour's message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few."""

However, the fact it was a former prime minister who first introduced him to the name is a nice tale.""I first heard of him from Margaret Thatcher can you believe, when I had my own fit of youthful endeavour in politics as a 16 year old, giving a speech at the Tory Party Conference in 1977,"" said the former Conservative leader. ""I was hauled off to meet Margaret Thatcher and she said to the assembled press: 'We could be standing here with another William Pitt' and I had no idea who that was, and I thought I'd better find out and as I did - over the next 20 years - I became quite an admirer.William Pitt the Younger, so styled because his father 'Pitt the Elder' had also been prime minister, was a political prodigy. He graduated from Cambridge at 17 and entered Parliament four years later in 1781. When he became prime minister he was still just 24 years old. Lord Hague said: ""He was written off at the time as a 'mince pie' prime minister, just in place for Christmas and then out, but he served for 19 years ... still our youngest and second-longest-serving prime minister"".Young Pitt was a reformer and counted the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce amongst his closest friends. While others referred to him as a Tory, he always maintained he was an independent. William Hague is profuse in his praise.""He seemed to me to be an undervalued figure in history, that his name would come up in an episode of Black Adder, as a figure of fun ... Actually he was a towering figure, who stood alone against Napoleon, who plotted naval strategy with Nelson, he dealt with the most extraordinary range of circumstances"" .Pitt had become prime minister when Britain was still reeling from the loss of its American colonies.  With the national debt spiralling upward ""Honest Billy"", as he was sometimes called in the press, set about steadying the ship. Later in his career he would introduce both income tax and the first paper money, not backed by actual gold. They were steps that didn't always make him popular, but as Lord Hague argues, they did produce results,""This was much mocked at the time ... but his keeping the country creditworthy, the inexhaustible credit of the City of London and Britain ... allowed it to overcome Napoleon in the end, because France they said could almost never run out of men, but Britain would never run out of money"". Pitt's rivalry with the French emperor would come to define his premiership.Despite his success, Pitt was famously aloof and even shy. He never married and his devotion to his country consumed his life. His drinking contributed to his death at just 46 years old. Former foreign secretary Lord Hague, who himself became party leader at the relatively young age of 36, feel some sympathy for him. ""Becoming so powerful so early in life, actually stunted his development as a human being in other ways because you don't make new friends or interests if you are at the heart of government ... I think all of us who are in those situations experience a bit of what William Pitt did ... but most of us leave at some point, he never did"".Lord Hague reserves his greatest admiration for Pitt the orator and parliamentarian,""He really gave full vent to his personality in Parliament and this is an age where the House of Commons had in it: Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, William Wilberforce, this is an age that makes today's Parliament look pedestrian in the extreme and he was the equal, if not the master, of them all.""William Pitt left office in 1801, but was prime minister again by 1804 and, despite warnings from his doctors that his work might kill him, he refused to leave his post and died as prime minister in 1806.In the end he was, Lord Hague said: ""The pilot who weathered the storm.""This interview is one of a series on politicians' political heroes, to be broadcast on the BBC's Daily Politics on Fridays."
2018-02-02,Women's outrage,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-42875095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRecently rediscovered 100-year-old posters showing the struggle for votes for women are going on show for the first time.  They pull no punches in their depiction of the strength of feeling among the women who fought for equal rights.Addressed simply to ""the Librarian"", a bundle wrapped in plain brown paper was delivered to Cambridge University Library sometime around 1910, and it took over 100 years for the contents of the parcel to be rediscovered, in 2016, preserved in their original wrapping.Underneath the faded paper was one of the largest surviving collections of suffrage posters from the early 20th Century. They had been sent by a leading figure of the suffrage movement, Marion Phillips, who became Labour MP for Sunderland in 1929. It is unclear why Phillips sent the posters.""They were created to be plastered on walls, torn down by weather or political opponents,"" says Chris Burgess, exhibitions officer at the library. ""So it is highly unusual for this material to be safely stored.""The posters are going on show to mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave the vote to women over the age of 30.Because of Cambridge's prestigious university, local suffrage posters often featured women in academic dress. Artists observed that the city's educated women were still grouped - in the eyes of the law - with the likes of convicts and lunatics.Although Cambridge's women-only colleges such as Girton and Newnham had very active suffrage societies, the university itself was far from progressive.By the end of the 19th Century, women were allowed to study at the university but were not given full degrees at the end of their studies. When an 1897 vote proposed to change this, there was outrage. An effigy of a lady cyclist - a symbol of the new woman - was torn down and destroyed to the delight of the jeering crowds of male students.Posters also tried to appeal to working-class women, such as those working in textile factories or at home as seamstresses.Some pointed out that these women were not even able to vote on laws that concerned women's regulations and rights. This meant men were voting on what they believed to be best for women.Lucy Delap, a historian specialising in this period, says most people in the UK were against women getting the vote. As a result, ""the suffrage movement definitely had to reach out to many women"".""Campaigning went far beyond the simple equality message - to point out how the vote could make a difference in households, at work, on the streets - matters that concerned all women,"" she says. Print production was central to the suffrage campaigns. ""People would be cranking out handbills to be distributed the same day through networks of sash-wearing volunteers, or printing posters advertising meetings taking place that same evening,"" says Delap. To appeal to the widest audience, Delap says, the suffrage posters took inspiration from the tabloids, using eye-catching headlines, large cartoons and photographs.And the suffragists were media-savvy political campaigners - reacting to the policies of the day. In 1909, there was a national outcry when Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone ordered that imprisoned protestors on hunger strike should be force-fed. John Bull - a fictional figure commonly used to personify the UK, and England in particular - is depicted in the image above. Without the help of a woman, he is struggling alone with children and housework, visual metaphors for the social problems of the Edwardian era.This poster suggests if women could vote, then problems including infant mortality, poor schooling and unemployment might more easily be solved for the benefit of everyone. ""Handicapped"" was one of the most popular posters of the suffrage campaign, painted by Bloomsbury Group artist Duncan Grant.It shows a young privileged man being easily propelled forwards by votes, while a woman struggles on choppier waters in a simple row boat.Mrs Partington was another familiar figure used by the UK press at the time. She was usually seen trying to stem progress with her mop. In this case, she is trying to stop the seeming flood of support for women's votes.The poster below called for support for political organisations - listed on the children's bibs - to be withdrawn until women were able to participate at the ballot box. Some posters explicitly call for ""law-abiding"" meetings. Delap says the movement was split over whether more violent action was needed.""There were militants who were willing to break the law: smashing windows, destroying golf courses, burning buildings,"" she says.""There were also non-violent actions that broke the law - refusing to fill in the census, refusing to pay tax without representation - a range of creative tactics.""But just to stand on a box in the marketplace, as many women did, provoked public fury, peltings with rotten vegetables and even police brutality. ""To be a female suffrage activist of any kind was a militant act.""  Our Weapon is Public Opinion: Posters of the Women's Suffrage Movement is on display at Cambridge University Library from 3 February."
2018-02-02,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-02,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180202215641/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

But a Commons Defence Select Committee report said such cuts would be ""militarily illiterate"".A MoD spokesman said ""protecting the UK will always be our priority"". The Tory-led committee's strongly worded report - called Sunset for the Royal Marines? - warns the rumoured cuts would weaken one of Britain's elite fighting forces.""Given the disproportionate contribution the Royal Marines make to defence and the sheer range and versatility of their military skills, both they and the country's security would be significantly undermined,"" they said.They also said slashing its two amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark - used to carry out beach landings - would ""put the interests of this country at serious risk"".Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis said if the ships were lost ""the heart would be torn out of our amphibious capability"".The Tory MP told the BBC: ""The MoD will have to beat [the money] out of the Treasury. ""The Treasury has got to cough up.""Mr Lewis added that recent years had seen ""new and intensified threats"" and the UK should not be ""deleting one of our world-beating capabilities"".The MPs' report also said cuts to the Royal Marines since 2011 had already led to ""a tangible drop in morale"" and ""particular embarrassment"" during exercises with the UK's allies.In response to the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said: ""Protecting the UK will always be our priority and the Royal Marines play a vital role in defending our country.""Just last week we launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our Armed Forces in the face of intensifying threats.""Our brand new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is central to our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future and is a symbol of our intent to remain a truly Global Britain."""
2018-02-03,Ministers 'vague' and 'divided' over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42935058,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA senior Conservative MP has accused ministers of being ""vague"" and ""divided"" over Brexit.  Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, arch Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin singled out the chancellor for criticism, urging him to back the PM to deliver a ""clean"" EU exit.He insisted Theresa May should stick to her present policy despite the Treasury having its own ""house view"".It comes ahead of key ministerial meetings on the UK-EU relationship.In the paper, Mr Jenkin, a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, said internal clashes were making life more difficult for Mrs May.""If ministers are vague or divided, life for officials becomes impossible, as we can see now. Ministerial collective responsibility really matters,"" he said.He added: ""If the prime minister sticks to one policy and the chancellor keeps advocating another, what are officials meant to do?""BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier described Mr Jenkin's comments as ""stark criticism"" of Philip Hammond.Earlier this month, Mr Hammond suggested the UK's relationship with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit.But Mr Jenkin urged the prime minister to stick to her position and ensure, among other things, Britain leaves the single market and customs union.He wrote: ""She can only command a majority in Parliament on her present policy.""Her MPs will back her, because we are overwhelmingly at one with the majority of the British people who now want a clean Brexit and an end to the present uncertainty.""Mr Jenkin was also referring to Treasury officials coming under fire from Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who claimed they were ""fiddling the figures"" on Brexit.Mr Jenkin defended all officials by saying ""unambiguous and united direction"" is needed from ministers and that accountability lies with the ministers, not the officials."

Whether we are prepared to accept a permanent coarsening and toxifying of our public debate or whether, together, we will take a stand for decency, tolerance and respect,"" Mrs May will add.In her speech, the prime minister will say that from May 2019 candidates in local elections will no longer be forced to publish their address on ballot papers.This would offer them the same protection as UK parliamentary candidates, who are not required to state where they live.Mrs May will also cite examples where certain individuals and their families had been targeted at home.A Labour spokesman said the party condemns personal attacks and that leader Jeremy Corbyn never engages in them.""Words have consequences and we all have a responsibility to ensure the political language we use does not incite hatred."""

Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, said: ""Just a few weeks ago the council was saying they could set a budget and it seems this announcement is more about the collapse of internal financial controls in the county council, which clearly are not adequate enough.""The government may have to intervene rather more quickly than it perhaps intended to. It might have to send in commissioners to run the county council.""The council announced in December that it was looking to increase council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of £34.3m.It was then revealed in January it was considering selling its new £53m headquarters, which officially opened in October.Last month, the government said an inspector would look into allegations of financial failings at the authority.Speaking to Labour's local government conference in Nottingham, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Austerity is unleashing chaos across our country, squeezing our local authorities and putting jobs, and the vital services they deliver, at risk."" Nick Golding, editor of the Local Government Chronicle, said as many as ten other councils could soon take measures similar to those implemented in Northamptonshire.""Council spending power has fallen by almost half this decade; it's been a really, really difficult time for councils and there haven't been any sensible conversations about how you can provide the funding for social care and children's services, in particular, in the years to come,"" he said.  ""No-one seems to be able to face up to the fact that the current local government finance system isn't working.  ""The danger is that councils will only provide an absolute bare minimum in the years to come.""Council staff are being paid which means libraries, schools and children's centres will stay open. The council's leader has said she understands potholes will still be fixed as that is an existing contract that will be honoured. But there will be no new deals, no new spending, on anything other than services legally required to keep vulnerable people safe.While life continues for now, the seriousness of this move should not be underestimated - a warning like this has not been made at any authority for almost two decades.It has serious long-term implications for the authority as councils have to balance the books by law.In Northamptonshire there are two levels of council and so services like bin collections and car parks are the responsibility of separate borough and district councils that are not affected. It is the first section 114 notice issued in about 20 years but Prof Tony Travers, from The London School of Economics, believes others could follow.He said: ""I think there are others that are quite close to Northamptonshire's position and, with so-called austerity continuing into the next decade, I would be amazed if Northamptonshire was the only council to get into these circumstances.""Bob Scott, leader of the Labour Group on Northamptonshire County Council, said: ""My only surprise is that a section 114 order has been issued just after an inspector has been appointed and started his work.""The implications are due to be discussed at the full council meeting on 22 February."
2018-02-03,Treasury 'fiddling figures' on Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42929071,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowProminent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" on Brexit to keep the UK in the European Union customs union.It comes amid claims, which the Treasury has denied, that it had deliberately created an economic model that made all other options look bad.The FDA union, which represents civil servants, attacked the MP for peddling ""unsubstantiated conspiracy theories"".The Treasury said it was working hard to deliver the best deal for Britain.Conservative MP Mr Rees-Mogg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If you look at the forecasts the Treasury made before the referendum, they were a humiliation. ""They were clearly politically influenced.""But FDA general secretary David Penman said the comments were ""clear evidence"" that the MP was ""prepared to sacrifice anyone or anything on the altar of his own ideology"".He told the BBC Theresa May had to ""get a grip on both her ministers - who are peddling these myths as well - and on Conservative politicians"".He said it should be the prime minister or Cabinet ministers defending the civil service - not him, and called for an end to ""constant swiping at the messenger"" which was undermining trust in the government and the civil service.The Treasury said that both the prime minister and the chancellor have repeatedly stated the UK will be leaving the single market and the customs union and that ""any suggestion to the contrary is simply false"".Mr Rees-Mogg said former chancellor George Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances, because Treasury forecasts ""had been politicised"". ""And it was thought they were unreliable on political grounds,"" he added. ""With the referendum and with the EU, the Treasury has gone back to making forecasts. ""It was politically advantageous for them in the past. It is the same now. ""So yes, I do think they are fiddling the figures.""By BBC political correspondent Matthew ColeThis is more than a row about a backbench MP challenging Treasury figures he doesn't like.Jacob Rees-Mogg leads a section of MPs on whom Theresa May's future might depend. That bloc - the Tories' European Research Group - are vehemently opposed to the UK staying in ANY form of customs union with the EU after Brexit. This week, key ministerial meetings will take place on that very subject, with Theresa May known to be against staying in THE customs union, but open-minded to setting up a less expansive arrangement. So Jacob Rees-Mogg's intervention could be taken as upping the ante, exerting extra pressure on Mrs May ahead of this big week, which could provide crucial answers to our future relations with the EU, and to the prime minister's future.His comments came after Theresa May, on the final day of her official visit to China, appeared to suggest some sort of customs agreement with the EU could be possible - even though ministers have said Britain will leave the existing customs union.Mr Rees-Mogg stated any such deal would be unacceptable to Tory Brexiteers as it would prevent the UK from striking free trade deals with other countries.""We need to be free to do deals with the rest of the world,"" he said.""We must be out of the protectionist common external tariff which mainly protects inefficient EU industries at the cost to British consumers.""It is the second time this week that Mr Rees-Mogg has condemned civil servants' economic forecast concerning the impact of Brexit.The row began on Tuesday with a report leaked to Buzzfeed which said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU.The government said its preferred option however - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. But in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Rees-Mogg asked Brexit minister Steve Baker to confirm whether he had heard that officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. He attributed the remarks to Charles Grant, the head of the Centre for European Reform.On Friday, Mr Baker apologised to MPs for saying Mr Rees-Mogg's account of the remarks was ""essentially correct"".Mr Grant had denied making them and an audio recording emerged where he did not say what was attributed to him. However, Mr Rees-Mogg said he stood by his original claim.Mr Grant told the BBC he was surprised that Mr Rees-Mogg had not apologised to him. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called Mr Rees-Mogg's claims about the Treasury ""absolutely outrageous"". ""The government should be thinking about all possibilities and how to minimise the damage from Brexit,"" he said. ""Serious Conservatives inside and outside government are saying that whatever happens with Brexit, we should remain in a customs union.""The Treasury would be failing in its duty if it didn't examine that possibility seriously; we should be inside a customs union whatever happens."""

He lost his Moray constituency to Conservative Douglas Ross in the UK general election last June.In a letter informing Nicola Sturgeon of his decision he said his mandate had been to partner her at Westminster but that it was now time to move on.He said in a tweet he would ""always be there to help Scotland reach its full potential"".Analysis by BBC Scotland Westminister correspondent Nick EardleyWe don't know for sure when the SNP's new deputy leader will be chosen - arrangements will be decided in ""due course"", the party says. It comes at an interesting time. The independence campaign was effectively parked after last year's election. But it's an issue the SNP Scottish government will have to decide on sooner rather than later in the context of Brexit. Clearly everyone who goes for the job will support independence, but how will the candidates approach the idea of a referendum in the next couple of years? And how will the membership react? Some thought after the election that the party needs to be more radical to counter Jeremy Corbyn's Labour. Someone from the party's left might fancy a stab at the deputy leader job.Mr Robertson was a respected figure at Westminster. In his resignation letter, he says he no longer felt able to fulfil his mandate as Nicola Sturgeon's eyes and ears in the Commons.The party may well want to keep its top two split between the two parliaments. It's also likely some at Holyrood will mull over a bid. Last time an MEP and a councillor threw their hats in the ring too. There's plenty to watch out for in the next few months.Tweeting a response to Mr Robertson, the first minister Ms Sturgeon described him as an ""outstanding"" deputy leader.She added: ""You should be very proud of your enormous contribution to our party's success. I wish you well and hope to see you back in frontline politics in the future.""In his letter Mr Robertson wrote: ""Since the 2017 general election I have been focussed on supporting campaign best practice for local SNP branches, constituency associations, elected members and the party nationally.""As discussed recently, I believe I am no longer able to fully discharge my mandate, which was to partner you as Westminster SNP leader and as a parliamentarian representing a rural constituency.""While it would be my greatest privilege to continue as deputy leader, I know you understand that I have to focus now on pursuing new career opportunities."" He added he was ""tremendously honoured"" to have held the role, and would now work to support public policy development in Scotland as an advisory board member of the Scottish Policy Foundation.Ms Sturgeon told the former MP he had ""always been a source of wise counsel"" to her, noting that when he was first elected to Westminster the SNP had just five MPs.The party went on to win 56 of the 59 seats up for grabs in Scotland in the 2015 general election, although it lost 21 of those constituencies some two years later.Ms Sturgeon said: ""Our political and electoral success over the last decade has been nothing short of extraordinary - and the party owes you an enormous debt of gratitude for the personal role you have played in bringing about that success.""That includes your part in the 2014 referendum which brought the country closer to independence than ever before.""After losing his seat in the general election, Mr Robertson was replaced as SNP Westminster leader by Ian Blackford.Mr Robertson had won widespread praise for his performance at PMQs, with many political opponents commending his questioning of the prime minister.When he was elected to the deputy leader role in October 2016 he succeed Stewart Hosie, who quit the position following claims about his personal life.The contest then was decided through a single transferable vote system that saw members rank the candidates in order of preference.All five of the party's last leaders - Nicola Sturgeon, Alex Salmond, John Swinney, Gordon Wilson and Billy Wolfe - had previously served as the party's deputy leader."

Almost 380 workers at Carillion will be made redundant.Carillion contractors who may not have the security otherwise needed for conventional bank lending can apply to lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest, Santander, and TSB, for a so-called Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) borrowing facility.Banks are cushioned from businesses defaulting on the loans by taxpayer cash - 75% of any losses to the lender will be picked up by the British Business Bank if the loan cannot be paid back.Additionally the UK banking sector has promised to take the circumstances surrounding Carillion into consideration if individuals face problems repaying loans, overdrafts or mortgages.By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondentThe government is determined to show that it has a grip on the Carillion crisis. And it needs to. At stake are not just the thousands of jobs directly employed but also the thousands of SMEs such as suppliers and contractors indirectly dependent on the former construction giant who will now not repay its debts.On top of that there's the ideology behind the likes of Carillion and outsourcing in general.Private finance initiatives and getting companies to do public sector work is an article of faith for the Conservative Party.If thousands of small firms collapse in a domino fashion due to Carillion, then the PFI as a policy will come under intense scrutiny."

Important next step in our work to build new partnership between UK & EUEnd of Twitter post  by @DavidDavisMPDuring the prime minister's three-day visit to China, Downing Street said more than £9bn of business deals were signed and it agreed to a joint investment and trade review as the ""first step"" to an ""ambitious"" post-Brexit deal with the world's second largest economy.However, Mrs May has faced growing criticism from MPs, including many in her own party, who have called for her to be more specific about her priorities on UK's future trade arrangements with the EU.In an interview with Bloomberg News, Liam Fox, who was with Mrs May in China, said the UK cannot be involved in any customs union with the EU following Brexit.Number 10 said the international trade secretary was speaking for the government - but also said the details of future arrangements with Brussels were a matter for negotiation.""It is fair to say the prime minister has an open mind when it comes to these negotiations,"" a Downing Street spokesman said.By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondentWhile Theresa May has been away - successfully signing trade deals -  I have been assessing the battles she faces on the home front, within her own party. What is most striking is that some who supported her have, at the very least, become wobblier. One ex-minister said he felt ""badly let down"". She has been accused of blocking, not delivering, radical change.A former supporter questioned her lack of decisiveness: ""She has more reviews than a film critic would produce in a lifetime.""A Remainer who despises Boris Johnson wondered if - to coin a phrase - the foreign secretary's ""bad leadership would be better than no leadership"". Council candidates fear poor results in London's May elections and think this could be a trigger for the PM to go. And a Conservative-supporting business leader felt - though he didn't advocate it - that her opponents ""will pull the pin from the grenade"". Downing Street believes the feeding frenzy of speculation will abate when more progress is made on EU withdrawal. But they are aware of the challenges at home as well as abroad.Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said she had already spelled out what she wants from the deal and did not believe the UK would have to choose between Europe and the rest of the world.""I don't believe that those are the alternatives,"" she said.""What the British people voted for is for us to take back control of our money, our borders and our laws and that's exactly what we are going to do.""We also want to ensure that we can trade across borders.""By Kerry Allen, China Media Analyst, BBC MonitoringMainland Chinese media have praised Theresa May's 31 January-2 February visit from start to finish. Official broadcaster CCTV says that the nickname media have given her - ""Auntie May"" - shows that she has become ""one of the family"" and newspapers have heralded her trip as showing that Sino-UK ties signal new heights for bilateral cultural exchanges, and post-Brexit trade deals.  They have also given a nod to Mrs May for, reportedly, not raising human rights issues in Hong Kong during her stay. Nationalist newspaper Global Times commends the UK prime minister for ""not making any comment contrary to the goals of her China trip"", saying ""the losses outweigh the gains if she appeases the British media at the cost of the visit's friendly atmosphere"".Independent Hong Kong and Taiwanese media have been critical of the Prime Minister for not raising the contentious issue of pro-democracy protests. Publications including influential paper South China Morning Post quote former British governor Chris Patten, who said the Hong Kong dialogue was ""critical"" to granting assurances that developing ties with the mainland won't come at Hong Kong's expense. The prime minister has come under pressure from Eurosceptics worried about potential concessions by the UK in the Brexit talks.Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested Britain's relationship with the EU would change only ""very modestly"" after Brexit.However, cabinet members - including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - have warned the UK will lose the main advantages of Brexit if it remains bound by trade rules of the single market and customs union.They have called for the prime minister to be clearer about her own position.She told the BBC her goal in upcoming talks with Europe was to strike a deal that ""is going to be good for trade between the UK and EU and good for jobs in Britain"".She added: ""It means a free trade agreement with the EU. We are now starting to negotiate that free trade agreement with the EU."" She has repeatedly said Brexit will mean leaving the single market and customs union. Asked again about her own future as prime minister, Mrs May said: ""I'm not a quitter. I'm in this because there is a job to be done here and that's delivering for the British people and doing that in a way that ensures the future prosperity of our country."""

But if it transpires that one or more students were involved then disciplinary action will be taken which could mean expulsion.""In a statement on Twitter the university added it was ""absolutely appalled by the conduct of a small number of attendees"" at the event.It continued: ""It is our understanding at this stage that a small group of protesters broke into the lecture theatre where the event was due to take place via the back doors.""We understand that these protesters were not UWE Bristol students and did not have tickets for the event.""We support the democratic right to free speech and peaceful protest. However, we strongly condemn the actions of protesters who disrupted normal debate and behaved in this way.""There is no place for such action on a university campus or in a civilised society.""It was due to be a fairly routine event - Jacob Rees-Mogg was booked to speak to a few hundred students at a ticketed event.He would've spoken for about half an hour before taking questions.Just a few minutes after he started speaking, a group of protesters came into the back of the lecture theatre and started shouting anti-Conservative rhetoric, very loudly, trying to shout him down.Rather than halting the event, or ignoring them, Mr Rees-Mogg walked up to the back of the theatre to try and talk them down.At that point, various other members of the audience got involved, leading to a scuffle.It looked to me that Mr Rees-Mogg was actually pushed and shoved, although he insists he wasn't.But it was a very aggressive and unexpected scene.After the scuffle, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""Some people who don't agree with me wanted to make their point, and I don't object to this. ""I think we live in a free society and freedom of speech is very important.""And people like me, who advocate freedom of speech, support it when it's not exactly what we want, as well as when it is what we want.""Universities Minister Sam Gyimah branded the protesters' behaviour ""thuggish"", adding: ""Free speech under the law is fundamental to our democracy.""He praised Mr Rees-Mogg for ""not being cowed into silence"".Absolutely disgusting.

2018-02-03,Haringey Momentum policies revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42920547,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe London borough of Haringey looks set be one of the first places in the UK where the kind of socialist policies advocated by Jeremy Corbyn-support group Momentum could be put into action. What can residents expect? Haringey Labour Party has recently been in the news for all the wrong reasons - de-selections, division, denunciations.But soon it may come under scrutiny more for policies than its internal processes.Opponents of Jeremy Corbyn say it will become the first Momentum council after May's local elections.Momentum is, of course, the left-wing campaign group set up after Mr Corbyn's initial victory as Labour leader to keep the spirit and politics of his campaign alive.If Labour - as is expected - wins in Haringey in 3 May's local elections, it's unlikely that the majority of councillors will be fully paid-up members of Momentum.But the group's representation will go up, its influence will increase and the council will move to the left  - and Momentum know that, in effect, they will be held responsible for its actions.The first stage in agreeing a manifesto for the local council elections will take place on Sunday, when about 300 Labour members will meet for a policy discussion.The BBC has seen ideas Momentum and allies on the party's left will be putting forward.They believe that local government manifestos should be at least as radical as those contained in Labour's 2017 general election manifesto.And that there should be a break from the past.So, while the outgoing Labour council wanted a 50/50 partnership with the private sector to redevelop a large council estate, the meeting on Sunday will discuss scrapping this and replacing it with an entirely council-run scheme.Beyond that, they are advocating radical ideas to underpin their anti-austerity agenda, including:In addition, Haringey could follow the example of other left-led councils such as Salford, which has given care workers a 10% pay increase, despite overall budget cuts.Sources say some of the previous speculation about what might be in Labour's manifesto - such as capping council salaries above £60,000 - is inaccurate. This idea has already been rejected, and never had widespread support.The hope on Labour's left is that they can turn the scrutiny on Haringey to their advantage and provide inspiration to other Labour councils. But at this stage none of the ideas appear to have costings attached.  And that scrutiny may blunt the party's cutting-edge ideas. One way of paying for council tax exemptions would be, for example, significantly hiking the levy on those who do pay - but I understand that there is an aversion to doing so in case the council gets quickly defined more for tax raising than redistribution.The potential policy programme did not impress Nora Mulready. She used to work for local MP David Lammy but has been highly critical of Momentum's growing influence in the borough and the removal of some sitting councillors. She resigned form Labour at the weekend and told the BBC: ""There is a battle for the political soul of the Labour Party between pragmatic people who will use any tools available to alleviate poverty - and those who place an antipathy to the private sector above the needs of people. ""Momentum activists at some point are going to come in to contact with reality and that will dramatically change what they are suggesting can happen.""But Labour MP Chris Williamson - a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn - hailed the discussions on the party's future direction, saying: ""We have a Labour Party that is  mass movement - some of the ideas the members in Haringey are looking at is a great exercise in democracy."" And he backed the ending of outsourcing, telling the BBC's Daily Politics: ""Most people don't like the fact that the private sector is essentially ripping-off the public purse.""Surely (it would) be better to have things delivered in-house - dividends dished out to shareholders would not be necessary and those profits could be reinvested and improve services.""However, the final local election manifesto that emerges in Haringey may not be quite as radical as envisaged. Ultimately, whatever the grassroots think, the current Labour group has to sign it off - and a majority of them oppose Momentum.  Although about a third of the current group of Labour councillors will be standing down - or have been deselected by a more left-wing membership - they may still be able to delete policies they don't like before they leave office.  But there is a widespread acceptance that the controversial public/private housing project will be an early casualty of the council's move to the left. "

Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject. If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out. At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position  of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed. Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap. Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down. Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part. MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn. Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.    But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example. It is going to be a long time before the builders move in. First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done. Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures. In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable. We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.  The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall.  This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future. Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network. It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap. A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law. A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates.

2018-02-03,EU's thinking,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42922796,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth £625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy.  The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO.  There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet.For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March. "

Jeremy Corbyn!'.Glastonbury is having a year off to protect the site, so Labour bosses have decided to set up a festival of their own.The event - called Labour Live - will be held in North London and is expected to attract stars who have publicly supported the Labour leader, though it is expected that some new names will be added to the setlist.  In the 2017 election campaign acts such as Clean Bandit, Steve Coogan, Maxine Peak and Wolf Alice appeared at Corbyn rallies. This isn't the first time political parties have tried to engage youth support through festivals. Last year the Conservative MP, George Freeman, set up a Conservative 'Ideas Festival'.  The Tories seeking young votersAn invite-only event, it was billed as a cross between book festival Hay-on-Wye and rock festival Latitude and saw 200 people trekking to the farm in Berkshire to develop their centre-right political thoughts. The 'Big Tent Ideas Festival' is coming back this summer, and we're told it is going to be ""much bigger and much more public"". Organisers say we can expect to hear from centre-right political thinkers alongside more arts, music and poetry - the date and full rundown will be announced in March.And let's not forget that back in the mid-1980s, a group of musicians including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Kirsty MacColl set up Red Wedge to support the Labour Party and organised a number of major tours. Artists like Bananarama, Elvis Costello, Sade and The Smiths were involved and a comedy circuit was later set up with comedians such as Lenny Henry, Harry Enfield and Robbie Coltrane.  But when the Tories won a third consecutive victory in 1987 the grouping fell away. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We are exploring options for ways to continue to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour's message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few."""

However, the fact it was a former prime minister who first introduced him to the name is a nice tale.""I first heard of him from Margaret Thatcher can you believe, when I had my own fit of youthful endeavour in politics as a 16 year old, giving a speech at the Tory Party Conference in 1977,"" said the former Conservative leader. ""I was hauled off to meet Margaret Thatcher and she said to the assembled press: 'We could be standing here with another William Pitt' and I had no idea who that was, and I thought I'd better find out and as I did - over the next 20 years - I became quite an admirer.William Pitt the Younger, so styled because his father 'Pitt the Elder' had also been prime minister, was a political prodigy. He graduated from Cambridge at 17 and entered Parliament four years later in 1781. When he became prime minister he was still just 24 years old. Lord Hague said: ""He was written off at the time as a 'mince pie' prime minister, just in place for Christmas and then out, but he served for 19 years ... still our youngest and second-longest-serving prime minister"".Young Pitt was a reformer and counted the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce amongst his closest friends. While others referred to him as a Tory, he always maintained he was an independent. William Hague is profuse in his praise.""He seemed to me to be an undervalued figure in history, that his name would come up in an episode of Black Adder, as a figure of fun ... Actually he was a towering figure, who stood alone against Napoleon, who plotted naval strategy with Nelson, he dealt with the most extraordinary range of circumstances"" .Pitt had become prime minister when Britain was still reeling from the loss of its American colonies.  With the national debt spiralling upward ""Honest Billy"", as he was sometimes called in the press, set about steadying the ship. Later in his career he would introduce both income tax and the first paper money, not backed by actual gold. They were steps that didn't always make him popular, but as Lord Hague argues, they did produce results,""This was much mocked at the time ... but his keeping the country creditworthy, the inexhaustible credit of the City of London and Britain ... allowed it to overcome Napoleon in the end, because France they said could almost never run out of men, but Britain would never run out of money"". Pitt's rivalry with the French emperor would come to define his premiership.Despite his success, Pitt was famously aloof and even shy. He never married and his devotion to his country consumed his life. His drinking contributed to his death at just 46 years old. Former foreign secretary Lord Hague, who himself became party leader at the relatively young age of 36, feel some sympathy for him. ""Becoming so powerful so early in life, actually stunted his development as a human being in other ways because you don't make new friends or interests if you are at the heart of government ... I think all of us who are in those situations experience a bit of what William Pitt did ... but most of us leave at some point, he never did"".Lord Hague reserves his greatest admiration for Pitt the orator and parliamentarian,""He really gave full vent to his personality in Parliament and this is an age where the House of Commons had in it: Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, William Wilberforce, this is an age that makes today's Parliament look pedestrian in the extreme and he was the equal, if not the master, of them all.""William Pitt left office in 1801, but was prime minister again by 1804 and, despite warnings from his doctors that his work might kill him, he refused to leave his post and died as prime minister in 1806.In the end he was, Lord Hague said: ""The pilot who weathered the storm.""This interview is one of a series on politicians' political heroes, to be broadcast on the BBC's Daily Politics on Fridays."
2018-02-03,Women's outrage,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-42875095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRecently rediscovered 100-year-old posters showing the struggle for votes for women are going on show for the first time.  They pull no punches in their depiction of the strength of feeling among the women who fought for equal rights.Addressed simply to ""the Librarian"", a bundle wrapped in plain brown paper was delivered to Cambridge University Library sometime around 1910, and it took over 100 years for the contents of the parcel to be rediscovered, in 2016, preserved in their original wrapping.Underneath the faded paper was one of the largest surviving collections of suffrage posters from the early 20th Century. They had been sent by a leading figure of the suffrage movement, Marion Phillips, who became Labour MP for Sunderland in 1929. It is unclear why Phillips sent the posters.""They were created to be plastered on walls, torn down by weather or political opponents,"" says Chris Burgess, exhibitions officer at the library. ""So it is highly unusual for this material to be safely stored.""The posters are going on show to mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave the vote to women over the age of 30.Because of Cambridge's prestigious university, local suffrage posters often featured women in academic dress. Artists observed that the city's educated women were still grouped - in the eyes of the law - with the likes of convicts and lunatics.Although Cambridge's women-only colleges such as Girton and Newnham had very active suffrage societies, the university itself was far from progressive.By the end of the 19th Century, women were allowed to study at the university but were not given full degrees at the end of their studies. When an 1897 vote proposed to change this, there was outrage. An effigy of a lady cyclist - a symbol of the new woman - was torn down and destroyed to the delight of the jeering crowds of male students.Posters also tried to appeal to working-class women, such as those working in textile factories or at home as seamstresses.Some pointed out that these women were not even able to vote on laws that concerned women's regulations and rights. This meant men were voting on what they believed to be best for women.Lucy Delap, a historian specialising in this period, says most people in the UK were against women getting the vote. As a result, ""the suffrage movement definitely had to reach out to many women"".""Campaigning went far beyond the simple equality message - to point out how the vote could make a difference in households, at work, on the streets - matters that concerned all women,"" she says. Print production was central to the suffrage campaigns. ""People would be cranking out handbills to be distributed the same day through networks of sash-wearing volunteers, or printing posters advertising meetings taking place that same evening,"" says Delap. To appeal to the widest audience, Delap says, the suffrage posters took inspiration from the tabloids, using eye-catching headlines, large cartoons and photographs.And the suffragists were media-savvy political campaigners - reacting to the policies of the day. In 1909, there was a national outcry when Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone ordered that imprisoned protestors on hunger strike should be force-fed. John Bull - a fictional figure commonly used to personify the UK, and England in particular - is depicted in the image above. Without the help of a woman, he is struggling alone with children and housework, visual metaphors for the social problems of the Edwardian era.This poster suggests if women could vote, then problems including infant mortality, poor schooling and unemployment might more easily be solved for the benefit of everyone. ""Handicapped"" was one of the most popular posters of the suffrage campaign, painted by Bloomsbury Group artist Duncan Grant.It shows a young privileged man being easily propelled forwards by votes, while a woman struggles on choppier waters in a simple row boat.Mrs Partington was another familiar figure used by the UK press at the time. She was usually seen trying to stem progress with her mop. In this case, she is trying to stop the seeming flood of support for women's votes.The poster below called for support for political organisations - listed on the children's bibs - to be withdrawn until women were able to participate at the ballot box. Some posters explicitly call for ""law-abiding"" meetings. Delap says the movement was split over whether more violent action was needed.""There were militants who were willing to break the law: smashing windows, destroying golf courses, burning buildings,"" she says.""There were also non-violent actions that broke the law - refusing to fill in the census, refusing to pay tax without representation - a range of creative tactics.""But just to stand on a box in the marketplace, as many women did, provoked public fury, peltings with rotten vegetables and even police brutality. ""To be a female suffrage activist of any kind was a militant act.""

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-03,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180204070806/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Quizzed on what the model might look like, she said she was ""not intimidated at all"" by critics' warnings about customs unions membership.Mr Hammond has said he hopes the UK and EU economies will only move ""very modestly"" apart after Brexit. But some Brexiteers say this would hamper the UK's ability to strike free trade deals with other countries after it leaves the EU.The 10-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee is due to meet on Wednesday and Thursday."
2018-02-04,Call for new tax to fund the NHS,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-42940433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA new ring-fenced tax to fund the NHS and social care has been proposed by a panel of health experts.The panel, set up by the Liberal Democrats, says the NHS in England should be given an extra £4bn on top of inflation in the next financial year.It has suggested replacing National Insurance with the new tax to close the funding gap.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said NHS funding ""is at a record high"".""[It] was prioritised in the Budget with an extra £2.8bn, on top of the additional £2bn already provided for social care over the next three years, and an additional £437m of funding for winter,"" the spokesperson said.The future of NHS money has been hotly debated as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources.Last month, tens of thousands of non-urgent operations were delayed.The 10-member panel included former NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson, Peter Carter, former chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing and Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs.It said on top of the £4bn extra needed for next year, an additional £2.5bn would be required for both 2019 and 2020. Prof Gerada said that one of the issues is that working people over the age of 60 benefit from a significantly reduced National Insurance contribution, and people over 65 do not pay it at all. She said National Insurance, which currently funds the NHS and social care, is inadequate as older people are living longer, and not contributing to the ring-fenced tax.She said: ""Old age is now between 85 and 95, so old age has significantly moved. ""Why shouldn't I pay for my fair share of contributions if I'm working?"" As part of the recommendations, the panel also suggested reinstating a cap on the costs paid by individuals on social care.In December, the government scrapped proposals to cap fees at £72,500.It supported creating an office for budget responsibility for health and called for a series of incentives to get people to save more towards their adult social care.The idea of a levy dedicated to funding the NHS was also suggested by former minister Nick Boles."

He said Mr Corbyn was an ""outstanding politician"" and that he and Ken Livingstone ""kept faith"".He also said he still believes a deal can be reached to restore Stormont. Profile: Gerry Adams Mr Adams repeated his party's belief that Brexit would be disastrous for the island of Ireland. The 69-year-old is due to step down as Sinn Féin leader next weekend, when he will be replaced by Mary Lou McDonald.He is one of the most recognisable and controversial figures in Irish politics and his departure marks a generational shift in the party's leadership.Speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr show, Mr Adams praised Mr Corbyn's approach to negotiations in the early days of the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell have both faced criticism over their past dealings with Sinn Féin, including their decision to meet the party at Westminster in the 1990s, before the IRA ceasefire.During last year's general election Mr Corbyn condemned the IRA's bombing campaign, after coming under pressure to distance himself from the group's activities.On Sunday, Mr Adams said: ""I would like to see Jeremy in that position [prime minister] for the benefit of people in Britain, leaving Ireland out of it.""I think Jeremy is an outstanding politician and I hope my endorsement of him is not used against him in the time ahead.""He and (former London Mayor) Ken Livingstone and others kept faith and they were the people who said, when others said no, talk.""They were the people who were open to conversation about how to deal with conflict and how to get conflict resolution processes.""Mr Adams' legacy as Sinn Féin leader will sharply divide opinion. He has always denied being a member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but to many people, he is a hate figure who publicly justified murders carried out by the group during more than 30 years of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Others have hailed him as a peacemaker, for leading the republican movement away from its long, violent campaign towards peaceful and democratic means.During the interview, he told Andrew Marr:  ""I would wish that no-one had been killed or injured in the course of the conflict.""We were able to come to an alternative. When you come forward with an alternative, sensible people will embrace that alternative.""Asked why he did not join the IRA when he was growing up in Belfast, Mr Adams replied: ""I've never distanced myself from the IRA.""He said: ""I did defend the IRA but I also was very critical of what the IRA did at times. The Birmingham pub bombings were wrong, I condemned that as well.""Mr Adams added:  ""You can only make moral judgements about people when you walk in their shoes.""Looking back on the violence, he said: ""Even if it is accidental, how could anyone stand over the killing of a child or a civilian?""In the awfulness and horror of war, you cannot stand over those incidents.""Asked by Mr Marr if he was a man of faith, he said that he was.""The one thing I know about Jesus is that he forgave, he didn't go around condemning,"" he said.""Treat people with dignity and people will respond in a dignified way; treat people badly and people will respond badly.""Mr Adams said he believed power sharing at Stormont could be restored.""I've every confidence in Michelle O'Neill (Sinn Féin's Stormont leader) in terms of her ability to make friends with the unionists and to go forward on the basis of equality,"" he said.The Sinn Féin leader said some unionists held ""very hard positions"", but others lived in the ""real world"".""They know they have to make friends with their neighbours and would have to go on. It is not about us any more, it is about the next generation."""
2018-02-04,Many earn 'paltry returns' for a degree,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-42923529,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMany graduates receive ""paltry returns"" for their degrees despite racking up £50,000 in debt, says the chairman of the Education Select Committee.Robert Halfon will say in a speech on Monday, that between a fifth and a third of graduates take non-graduate jobs, and that any extra returns for having a degree ""vary wildly"".He will also suggest that too many people are studying academic degrees.University leaders maintain that a degree remains an excellent investment.In his speech on Monday, Mr Halfon, a former skills minister, will say the nation has ""become obsessed with full academic degrees"".""We are creating a higher education system that overwhelmingly favours academic degrees, while intermediate and higher technical offerings are comparatively tiny.""The labour market does not need an ever-growing supply of academic degrees. Between a fifth and a third of our graduates take non-graduate jobs. ""The 'graduate premium' varies wildly according to subject and institution. For many, the returns are paltry.""The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don'tAt the Centre for Social Justice, he will say there is an ""enormous opportunity in rebalancing higher education"" and a strong need for intermediate skills. ""There are skills shortages in several sectors. And there are millions of people who want to get on in life - preferably without a lead weight of £50,000 dragging from their feet,"" he adds.He suggests: ""If we are going to continue to lavishly furnish universities with taxpayers' money, we need to think about how universities can specialise in these areas. ""Existing universities that do not provide a good return on academic courses could reinvent themselves as centres of technical excellence.""His comments come as the latest University and College Admissions Service figures show a small drop in the number of people applying to higher education in the UK. Last year 559,030 people, including foreign students, applied to UK universities. This is the lowest number since 2014. A breakdown shows that there were 12,420 fewer UK applicants, a 2.6% drop compared to last year. It is the second annual drop in a row.Most of this comes from a drop in 18 and 19-year-olds submitting applications, accounting for 70% of the fall in UK applicants, according to Ucas.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, umbrella organisation for universities, said: ""This small drop in applicant figures can be attributed largely to the fall in the number of 18-year-olds across the UK population. ""This group makes up half of all UK applicants to universities. But the demand for courses from 18-year-olds across the UK remains strong, highlighting the continued demand for university education.""A spokesman for UUK said: ""Official figures are clear that, on average, university graduates continue to earn substantially more than non-graduates and are more likely to be in employment. A university degree remains an excellent investment.""We must, however, be careful to avoid using graduate salaries as the single measure of success in higher education. Many universities specialise in fields such as the arts, the creative industries, nursing and public sector professions that, despite making an essential contribution to society and the economy, pay less on average.""But there has been growing concern about the amount of debt students are accumulating and the interest being charged on that debt.The government has promised a review of higher education funding in England in response.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said legislation had been introduced to reform higher education to ensure that students and the taxpayer got value for money. ""The government wants everyone to be equipped with the skills they need to get on in life and succeed in the jobs of the future,"" the spokesperson said."

The Tory-led committee's strongly worded report - called Sunset for the Royal Marines? - warns the rumoured cuts would weaken one of Britain's elite fighting forces.""Given the disproportionate contribution the Royal Marines make to defence and the sheer range and versatility of their military skills, both they and the country's security would be significantly undermined,"" they said.They also said slashing its two amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark - used to carry out beach landings - would ""put the interests of this country at serious risk"".The former head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, said the UK's ""capability will have been cut by a half"" since 2010 if the cuts go ahead.""I don't think the British people realise what cuts the military have had,"" he said.Theresa May and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson are understood to have both rejected the cost-cutting proposals before Christmas, but concern over funding remains.Last month, Mr Williamson announced a new review, the Defence Modernisation Programme, focusing solely on military defence. Mr Williamson has indicated he will demand more money if the review deems it necessary.""Gavin Williamson deserves credit for seizing back control of the defence dimension of the NSCR (National Security Capability Review) process,"" said Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis. ""But, ultimately, he will fail without extra funding from the Treasury.""If the ships were lost ""the heart would be torn out of our amphibious capability"", Mr Lewis added.The Tory MP told the BBC: ""The Treasury has got to cough up.""  In December, analysis by the House of Commons Library found that between 2010 and 2015 the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) budget had fallen by £8bn in real terms.Since then, spending has stabilised and in the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017), £35.3bn was spent on defence.In 2016, the UK had the fifth biggest defence budget  - the highest of all EU countries - according to an international military study.Mr Lewis added that recent years had seen ""new and intensified threats"" and the UK should not be ""deleting one of our world-beating capabilities"".The MPs' report also said cuts to the Royal Marines since 2011 had already led to ""a tangible drop in morale"" and ""particular embarrassment"" during exercises with the UK's allies.In response to the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Royal Marines ""play a vital role"" in defending the country.""Just last week we launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our Armed Forces in the face of intensifying threats,"" he said.""Our brand new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is central to our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future and is a symbol of our intent to remain a truly Global Britain.""The £3.1bn HMS Queen Elizabeth was unveiled in 2017. It later reported leaks during its first sea trial."

Philip Hollobone, Conservative MP for Kettering, said: ""Just a few weeks ago the council was saying they could set a budget and it seems this announcement is more about the collapse of internal financial controls in the county council, which clearly are not adequate enough.""The government may have to intervene rather more quickly than it perhaps intended to. It might have to send in commissioners to run the county council.""The council announced in December that it was looking to increase council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of £34.3m.It was then revealed in January it was considering selling its new £53m headquarters, which officially opened in October.Last month, the government said an inspector would look into allegations of financial failings at the authority.Speaking to Labour's local government conference in Nottingham, the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Austerity is unleashing chaos across our country, squeezing our local authorities and putting jobs, and the vital services they deliver, at risk."" Nick Golding, editor of the Local Government Chronicle, said as many as ten other councils could soon take measures similar to those implemented in Northamptonshire.""Council spending power has fallen by almost half this decade; it's been a really, really difficult time for councils and there haven't been any sensible conversations about how you can provide the funding for social care and children's services, in particular, in the years to come,"" he said.  ""No-one seems to be able to face up to the fact that the current local government finance system isn't working.  ""The danger is that councils will only provide an absolute bare minimum in the years to come.""Council staff are being paid which means libraries, schools and children's centres will stay open. The council's leader has said she understands potholes will still be fixed as that is an existing contract that will be honoured. But there will be no new deals, no new spending, on anything other than services legally required to keep vulnerable people safe.While life continues for now, the seriousness of this move should not be underestimated - a warning like this has not been made at any authority for almost two decades.It has serious long-term implications for the authority as councils have to balance the books by law.In Northamptonshire there are two levels of council and so services like bin collections and car parks are the responsibility of separate borough and district councils that are not affected. It is the first section 114 notice - a provision of the Local Government Finance Act - issued in about 20 years but Prof Tony Travers, from The London School of Economics, believes others could follow.He said: ""I think there are others that are quite close to Northamptonshire's position and, with so-called austerity continuing into the next decade, I would be amazed if Northamptonshire was the only council to get into these circumstances.""Bob Scott, leader of the Labour Group on Northamptonshire County Council, said: ""My only surprise is that a section 114 order has been issued just after an inspector has been appointed and started his work.""The implications are due to be discussed at the full council meeting on 22 February."

Theresa May will make an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and say it is unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political view.She will consider a new offence to protect politicians and their families.A report previously found women, ethnic minority and gay candidates were most likely to be targets of abuse.The move follows a week in which Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was caught up in a scuffle at a Bristol university  and Labour Haringey council leader Claire Kober quit over claims of sexism and bullying by party supporters.Ms Kober told the BBC's Andrew Marr she does not blame individuals, but pointed to a ""particular political toxic culture"" across the whole country.In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, Mrs May will pay tribute to those who braved ""open hostility and abuse"".The Representation of the People Act, passed on 6 February 1918, gave the vote to women over the age of 30 and ""of property"".But 100 years on, the prime minister will say political discussion is becoming harder to have without resulting in ""tribalism and rancour"".While British democracy is ""robust and oppositional"", Mrs May will say a line has been crossed when disagreement turns to intimidation.Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, has previously warned the level of personal abuse had reached a ""tipping point"" and could deter people from running for office.""The abuse I receive personally tends to come from the hard right of politics,"" said Labour MP Cat Smith.""The organised groups tend to be Britain First, the EDL, who are very threatening,"" she said.One comment she received read: ""I want to see your head swinging from Tower Bridge.""Ms Smith said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" female MPs received more abuse - particularly those from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.She wrote letter to Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin, accusing the party of ""propagating personal attacks, smears and untruths"".""Some of the very personal attacks bordered on the racist,"" she told the BBC. ""It almost gives people permission, who are racist online, to take that a step further."" MPs reveal scale of abuse they receiveMrs May will also highlight exploitation of social media and the option to be anonymous.""It is time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this. Whether we are prepared to accept a permanent coarsening and toxifying of our public debate or whether, together, we will take a stand for decency, tolerance and respect,"" Mrs May will add.Among those to reveal the abuse experienced on a daily basis, has been shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott. Using strong and graphic language, she told a Westminster Hall debate about the torrent of ""mindless"" abuse  - including death threats - that she and her staff receive, which had been ""turbo charged"" by the speed and anonymity of social media.In her speech, the prime minister will announce that from May 2019 candidates in local elections will no longer be forced to publish their address on ballot papers.This would offer them the same protection as UK parliamentary candidates, who are not required to state where they live.Mrs May will also cite examples where certain individuals and their families had been targeted at home.A Labour spokesman said the party condemns personal attacks and that leader Jeremy Corbyn never engages in them.""Words have consequences and we all have a responsibility to ensure the political language we use does not incite hatred."""

""It is believed that damage was caused to the wheel-clamp of a car,"" the PSNI spokeswoman added. Sinn Féin said the matter was being dealt with by Mr Kelly's solicitor.The incident happened near the Metropolitan Arts Centre (MAC).The clamp was fitted by a private company called Parking and Enforcement Agency (PEA).Its spokesman told the Belfast Telegraph: ""PEA is aware of this incident and has reported the matter to the PSNI as we do in all such cases.""Mr Kelly is also Sinn Féin's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account.Mr Dodds, DUP, asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this?""Nobody's holding their breath.""Mr Dodds said the Sinn Féin ""preach"" respect and equality but this incident suggested otherwise.Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald, who will take over the party leadership next weekend, said she did not know enough about the incident to comment.Speaking to RTÉ on Sunday morning, she said: ""Gerry's solicitors are currently dealing the issue of the clamping.""I have to tell you that I don't have the detail on it and we'll have to see what flows from that but I'm reluctant to comment any further because I don't have the facts of exactly what happened.""I'm only in a position to say that his solicitors are dealing with the issue, as they should,"" she added.The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party, Jim Allister, criticised Mr Kelly on BBC Radio Ulster.""He, who sat in the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behaved in this manner needs to be called to account. ""Not just in respect of the criminal law, in regard to criminal damage, but in respect of public representation, by being removed as a public representative.""Ulster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs said Mr Kelly had set ""an appalling example"" and should ""do the decent thing and resign"".""Parking in a no-parking area, which reserves access for deliveries and emergencies, then damaging private property. ""What if everyone ignored yellow lines?""Is Gerry special, above the rules that apply to you and me?""Mr Beggs added: ""If this was to happen in any other part of the United Kingdom or indeed the Republic, the relevant politician would be gone.""Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said Mr Kelly's actions were ""ironic"" given that he was Sinn Féin's spokesperson on justice issues.""This is the sort of stuff that reflects very much on the behaviour of MLAs and I would very much like the assembly back up and running this week so that this could be looked at as an internal matter in terms of his conduct as a public representative."""

""They were clearly politically influenced.""But FDA general secretary David Penman said the comments were ""clear evidence"" that the MP was ""prepared to sacrifice anyone or anything on the altar of his own ideology"".He told the BBC Theresa May had to ""get a grip on both her ministers - who are peddling these myths as well - and on Conservative politicians"".He said it should be the prime minister or Cabinet ministers defending the civil service - not him, and called for an end to ""constant swiping at the messenger"" which was undermining trust in the government and the civil service.The Treasury said that both the prime minister and the chancellor have repeatedly stated the UK will be leaving the single market and the customs union and that ""any suggestion to the contrary is simply false"".Mr Rees-Mogg said former chancellor George Osborne had set up the Office for Budget Responsibility, which provides independent analysis of the UK's public finances, because Treasury forecasts ""had been politicised"". ""And it was thought they were unreliable on political grounds,"" he added. ""With the referendum and with the EU, the Treasury has gone back to making forecasts. ""It was politically advantageous for them in the past. It is the same now. ""So yes, I do think they are fiddling the figures.""By BBC political correspondent Matthew ColeThis is more than a row about a backbench MP challenging Treasury figures he doesn't like.Jacob Rees-Mogg leads a section of MPs on whom Theresa May's future might depend. That bloc - the Tories' European Research Group - are vehemently opposed to the UK staying in ANY form of customs union with the EU after Brexit. This week, key ministerial meetings will take place on that very subject, with Theresa May known to be against staying in THE customs union, but open-minded to setting up a less expansive arrangement. So Jacob Rees-Mogg's intervention could be taken as upping the ante, exerting extra pressure on Mrs May ahead of this big week, which could provide crucial answers to our future relations with the EU, and to the prime minister's future.His comments came after Theresa May, on the final day of her official visit to China, appeared to suggest some sort of customs agreement with the EU could be possible - even though ministers have said Britain will leave the existing customs union.Mr Rees-Mogg stated any such deal would be unacceptable to Tory Brexiteers as it would prevent the UK from striking free trade deals with other countries.""We need to be free to do deals with the rest of the world,"" he said.""We must be out of the protectionist common external tariff which mainly protects inefficient EU industries at the cost to British consumers.""It is the second time this week that Mr Rees-Mogg has condemned civil servants' economic forecast concerning the impact of Brexit.The row began on Tuesday with a report leaked to Buzzfeed which said growth would be lower in each of three different Brexit outcomes than if the UK had stayed in the EU.The government said its preferred option however - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. But in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Rees-Mogg asked Brexit minister Steve Baker to confirm whether he had heard that officials were deliberately trying to influence policy in favour of staying in the EU customs union. He attributed the remarks to Charles Grant, the head of the Centre for European Reform.On Friday, Mr Baker apologised to MPs for saying Mr Rees-Mogg's account of the remarks was ""essentially correct"".Mr Grant had denied making them and an audio recording emerged where he did not say what was attributed to him. However, Mr Rees-Mogg said he stood by his original claim.Mr Grant told the BBC he was surprised that Mr Rees-Mogg had not apologised to him. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called Mr Rees-Mogg's claims about the Treasury ""absolutely outrageous"". ""The government should be thinking about all possibilities and how to minimise the damage from Brexit,"" he said. ""Serious Conservatives inside and outside government are saying that whatever happens with Brexit, we should remain in a customs union.""The Treasury would be failing in its duty if it didn't examine that possibility seriously; we should be inside a customs union whatever happens."""

He made clear to parliament he felt such clear deficiencies in the SPA board's decision-making process were completely unacceptable.""Mr Matheson asked that further engagement and consultation be undertaken, to which the former SPA chair agreed. As noted by the former chair, Mr Matheson did not direct the SPA board to reverse its decision.""The first minister has already made it clear to parliament that she supports the justice secretary's actions. We will respond to Mr Johnson's letter in due course."""

Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject. If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out. At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position  of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed. Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap. Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down. Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part. MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn. Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.    But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example. It is going to be a long time before the builders move in. First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done. Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures. In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable. We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.  The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall.  This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future. Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network. It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap. A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law. A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates.

2018-02-04,EU's thinking,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42922796,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth £625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy.  The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO.  There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet.For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March. "

That's what this is about and I know what the British people want as well is good jobs for themselves and their children, and that's why it is important for me to be here in China where businesses have been signing deals.""Her comments will do little to dispel the tension at home where there are growing calls for her to be more specific about her ambition.With disagreement in cabinet and from top to bottom in the Conservative party over the direction to take, Theresa May seems not ready yet to have the argument over which way to go, in public at least.  The prime minister also made it plain she has no intention of walking away from her post any time soon.Read more from Laura"
2018-02-04,Corbyn fest,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42923433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Labour Party is planning a summer music festival to celebrate leader Jeremy Corbyn, it has emerged.Mr Corbyn addressed tens of thousands of muddy festivalgoers from the pyramid stage of at Glastonbury last summer, to chants of 'Oh! Jeremy Corbyn!'.Glastonbury is having a year off to protect the site, so Labour bosses have decided to set up a festival of their own.The event - called Labour Live - will be held in North London and is expected to attract stars who have publicly supported the Labour leader, though it is expected that some new names will be added to the setlist.  In the 2017 election campaign acts such as Clean Bandit, Steve Coogan, Maxine Peak and Wolf Alice appeared at Corbyn rallies. This isn't the first time political parties have tried to engage youth support through festivals. Last year the Conservative MP, George Freeman, set up a Conservative 'Ideas Festival'.  The Tories seeking young votersAn invite-only event, it was billed as a cross between book festival Hay-on-Wye and rock festival Latitude and saw 200 people trekking to the farm in Berkshire to develop their centre-right political thoughts. The 'Big Tent Ideas Festival' is coming back this summer, and we're told it is going to be ""much bigger and much more public"". Organisers say we can expect to hear from centre-right political thinkers alongside more arts, music and poetry - the date and full rundown will be announced in March.And let's not forget that back in the mid-1980s, a group of musicians including Billy Bragg, Paul Weller and Kirsty MacColl set up Red Wedge to support the Labour Party and organised a number of major tours. Artists like Bananarama, Elvis Costello, Sade and The Smiths were involved and a comedy circuit was later set up with comedians such as Lenny Henry, Harry Enfield and Robbie Coltrane.  But when the Tories won a third consecutive victory in 1987 the grouping fell away. A Labour spokesperson said: ""We are exploring options for ways to continue to open up politics to a wider audience and spread Labour's message about how we can build a society that works for the many, not the few."""

However, the fact it was a former prime minister who first introduced him to the name is a nice tale.""I first heard of him from Margaret Thatcher can you believe, when I had my own fit of youthful endeavour in politics as a 16 year old, giving a speech at the Tory Party Conference in 1977,"" said the former Conservative leader. ""I was hauled off to meet Margaret Thatcher and she said to the assembled press: 'We could be standing here with another William Pitt' and I had no idea who that was, and I thought I'd better find out and as I did - over the next 20 years - I became quite an admirer.William Pitt the Younger, so styled because his father 'Pitt the Elder' had also been prime minister, was a political prodigy. He graduated from Cambridge at 17 and entered Parliament four years later in 1781. When he became prime minister he was still just 24 years old. Lord Hague said: ""He was written off at the time as a 'mince pie' prime minister, just in place for Christmas and then out, but he served for 19 years ... still our youngest and second-longest-serving prime minister"".Young Pitt was a reformer and counted the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce amongst his closest friends. While others referred to him as a Tory, he always maintained he was an independent. William Hague is profuse in his praise.""He seemed to me to be an undervalued figure in history, that his name would come up in an episode of Black Adder, as a figure of fun ... Actually he was a towering figure, who stood alone against Napoleon, who plotted naval strategy with Nelson, he dealt with the most extraordinary range of circumstances"" .Pitt had become prime minister when Britain was still reeling from the loss of its American colonies.  With the national debt spiralling upward ""Honest Billy"", as he was sometimes called in the press, set about steadying the ship. Later in his career he would introduce both income tax and the first paper money, not backed by actual gold. They were steps that didn't always make him popular, but as Lord Hague argues, they did produce results,""This was much mocked at the time ... but his keeping the country creditworthy, the inexhaustible credit of the City of London and Britain ... allowed it to overcome Napoleon in the end, because France they said could almost never run out of men, but Britain would never run out of money"". Pitt's rivalry with the French emperor would come to define his premiership.Despite his success, Pitt was famously aloof and even shy. He never married and his devotion to his country consumed his life. His drinking contributed to his death at just 46 years old. Former foreign secretary Lord Hague, who himself became party leader at the relatively young age of 36, feel some sympathy for him. ""Becoming so powerful so early in life, actually stunted his development as a human being in other ways because you don't make new friends or interests if you are at the heart of government ... I think all of us who are in those situations experience a bit of what William Pitt did ... but most of us leave at some point, he never did"".Lord Hague reserves his greatest admiration for Pitt the orator and parliamentarian,""He really gave full vent to his personality in Parliament and this is an age where the House of Commons had in it: Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, William Wilberforce, this is an age that makes today's Parliament look pedestrian in the extreme and he was the equal, if not the master, of them all.""William Pitt left office in 1801, but was prime minister again by 1804 and, despite warnings from his doctors that his work might kill him, he refused to leave his post and died as prime minister in 1806.In the end he was, Lord Hague said: ""The pilot who weathered the storm.""This interview is one of a series on politicians' political heroes, to be broadcast on the BBC's Daily Politics on Fridays."
2018-02-04,Women's outrage,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-42875095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRecently rediscovered 100-year-old posters showing the struggle for votes for women are going on show for the first time.  They pull no punches in their depiction of the strength of feeling among the women who fought for equal rights.Addressed simply to ""the Librarian"", a bundle wrapped in plain brown paper was delivered to Cambridge University Library sometime around 1910, and it took over 100 years for the contents of the parcel to be rediscovered, in 2016, preserved in their original wrapping.Underneath the faded paper was one of the largest surviving collections of suffrage posters from the early 20th Century. They had been sent by a leading figure of the suffrage movement, Marion Phillips, who became Labour MP for Sunderland in 1929. It is unclear why Phillips sent the posters.""They were created to be plastered on walls, torn down by weather or political opponents,"" says Chris Burgess, exhibitions officer at the library. ""So it is highly unusual for this material to be safely stored.""gThe posters going on show to mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave the vote to women over the age of 30.Because of Cambridge's prestigious university, local suffrage posters often featured women in academic dress. Artists observed that the city's educated women were still grouped - in the eyes of the law - with the likes of convicts and lunatics.Although Cambridge's women-only colleges such as Girton and Newnham had very active suffrage societies, the university itself was far from progressive.By the end of the 19th Century, women were allowed to study at the university but were not given full degrees at the end of their studies. When an 1897 vote proposed to change this, there was outrage. An effigy of a lady cyclist - a symbol of the new woman - was torn down and destroyed to the delight of the jeering crowds of male students.Posters also tried to appeal to working-class women, such as those working in textile factories or at home as seamstresses.Some pointed out that these women were not even able to vote on laws that concerned women's regulations and rights. This meant men were voting on what they believed to be best for women.Lucy Delap, a historian specialising in this period, says most people in the UK were against women getting the vote. As a result, ""the suffrage movement definitely had to reach out to many women"".""Campaigning went far beyond the simple equality message - to point out how the vote could make a difference in households, at work, on the streets - matters that concerned all women,"" she says. Print production was central to the suffrage campaigns. ""People would be cranking out handbills to be distributed the same day through networks of sash-wearing volunteers, or printing posters advertising meetings taking place that same evening,"" says Delap. To appeal to the widest audience, Delap says, the suffrage posters took inspiration from the tabloids, using eye-catching headlines, large cartoons and photographs.And the suffragists were media-savvy political campaigners - reacting to the policies of the day. In 1909, there was a national outcry when Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone ordered that imprisoned protestors on hunger strike should be force-fed. John Bull - a fictional figure commonly used to personify the UK, and England in particular - is depicted in the image above. Without the help of a woman, he is struggling alone with children and housework, visual metaphors for the social problems of the Edwardian era.This poster suggests if women could vote, then problems including infant mortality, poor schooling and unemployment might more easily be solved for the benefit of everyone. ""Handicapped"" was one of the most popular posters of the suffrage campaign, painted by Bloomsbury Group artist Duncan Grant.It shows a young privileged man being easily propelled forwards by votes, while a woman struggles on choppier waters in a simple row boat.Mrs Partington was another familiar figure used by the UK press at the time. She was usually seen trying to stem progress with her mop. In this case, she is trying to stop the seeming flood of support for women's votes.The poster below called for support for political organisations - listed on the children's bibs - to be withdrawn until women were able to participate at the ballot box. Some posters explicitly call for ""law-abiding"" meetings. Delap says the movement was split over whether more violent action was needed.""There were militants who were willing to break the law: smashing windows, destroying golf courses, burning buildings,"" she says.""There were also non-violent actions that broke the law - refusing to fill in the census, refusing to pay tax without representation - a range of creative tactics.""But just to stand on a box in the marketplace, as many women did, provoked public fury, peltings with rotten vegetables and even police brutality. ""To be a female suffrage activist of any kind was a militant act.""  Our Weapon is Public Opinion: Posters of the Women's Suffrage Movement is on display at Cambridge University Library from 3 February."
2018-02-04,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-04,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205075128/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

""There's no doubt about it. We are leaving the customs union but we are aiming for a good future for Britain,"" Mr Davis said.He also said he was confident the two sides would reach an agreement on a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" phase - to last between 18 months and two years after the UK leaves next year - in time for an EU summit at the end of March.After lunch with Mr Davis and a 20-minute meeting with Theresa May, Mr Barnier said there was ""some divergence"" between the two sides when it came to issues relating to transition and how the exit deal would be enforced. While he said he respected the UK's decision to rule out any form of long-term customs union and other so-called ""red lines"", he said it was a prerequisite of any deal that ""everyone plays by the same rules"" during the transition period - where the UK would have to comply with existing EU laws and regulations.He said he wanted greater clarity from the UK about what ultimate partnership it wanted with the EU after its departure, expressing his hope an ""official position"" would be put forward soon.The PM welcomed @MichelBarnier to Downing Street today ahead of discussions with @DavidDavisMP on the upcoming negotiations of the implementation period. pic.twitter.com/lR69NdU5MREnd of Twitter post  by @Number10gov""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice.""The government's 11-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and Thursday as UK officials prepare to brief their EU counterparts on their vision for post-Brexit relations on Friday. At the same time, there will be initial discussions on the ""transitional"" period as well as efforts to convert the details of December's agreement on the Irish border, citizens' rights and money into a legal framework. Ahead of this, Downing Street ruled out any form of customs union with the EU, which would give the UK access to tariff-free trade within the bloc but mean it cannot negotiate its own deals with other countries.1. half a dozen Tory MP s expressed frustration to Chief Whip in No 10 meeting this morning after overnight briefing on customs unionEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakDowning Street said the government had set out two potential alternatives last summer - a new customs partnership without the need for any customs checks and a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement in which EU arrivals would be subject to customs checks but in a way that minimised disruption through technology.No 10 would not say which was the preferred option and said work was continuing on both proposals.Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said Switzerland was an example of a country which had both its own customs arrangements with the EU and an independent trade policy.""Britain is a global country, a world trader,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics, adding that the UK had been ""artificially penalised"" by the customs unions because it trades more outside the EU than inside.But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he found Downing Street's intervention ""rather strange"" since the UK would have to maintain some form of ""customs union or alignment"" with the EU if it was to honour the terms of its agreement to prevent any hard border on the island of Ireland.Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said.In the House of Commons, ministers faced criticism for delays in putting forward new post-Brexit immigration rules.The government has said new border controls will be brought in when EU free movement rules no longer apply, but a promised White Paper policy document has yet to be published.Businesses groups have expressed frustration at the wait for concrete proposals.And in an urgent Commons question, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""kicking the can down the road"".Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denied this, saying it was ""imperative"" that the White Paper and an immigration bill were the ""right pieces of legislation"" when they were brought to the Commons.""We will publish a White Paper in the coming months, when the time is right,"" she said."
2018-02-05,Trump: NHS 'going broke and not working',https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42943768,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUS President Donald Trump has sparked a backlash from UK politicians by attacking the National Health Service.In a tweet criticising US Democrats pushing for a universal health system, he said ""thousands of people are marching"" in the UK because the NHS is ""going broke and not working"".This was believed to be a reference to a Save the NHS march on Downing Street on Saturday, demanding more funding.Downing Street said Theresa May was ""proud"" of the UK's system.Her spokesman said the NHS had recently been ranked as the world's best healthcare system and that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has hit back at the US president on Twitter, ""speaks for the government"".Organisers of the demonstration said it had been aimed at showing people's ""love"" for the NHS. The chief executive of NHS England said the US president had ""got the wrong end of the stick"".In the UK, the NHS is funded out of general taxation, so people do not have to pay when they get treatment. In the US, when people get treatment they have to pay, most often through health insurance providers.President Trump's tweet came after ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox And Friends, one of the president's favourite shows, talking about the weekend march.""Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care,"" Mr Trump tweeted.In response, Mr Hunt said that while he ""disagreed with claims made on that march"", no-one wanted ""to live in a system where 28 million people have no cover"".He added: ""NHS may have challenges but I'm proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage - where all get care, no matter the size of their bank balance.""Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - the leader of the UK opposition - also hit back, saying: ""People were marching because we love our NHS and hate what the Tories are doing to it.""He added: ""Healthcare is a human right.""Donald Trump has said that he doesn't watch much television, claiming once he was too busy ""reading documents"".Time and again, however, the president has praised and promoted specific Fox News programmes - particularly the cable network's morning offering, Fox and Friends. Such was the case on Monday, as the president tweeted about the National Health Service shortly after former UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox to criticise the NHS during a segment on a recent London protest march.Healthcare reform, while a major topic of partisan debate in the US last year, has fallen off the radar recently. Republicans tried, and failed, to roll back government regulation of the insurance industry instituted by Barack Obama. In last week's State of the Union address, Mr Trump barely mentioned the topic.When Fox News catches the president's attention, however, that can change with the flick of a Twitter finger.NHS funding has been hotly debated in the UK as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources.A panel set up by the Liberal Democrats - the fourth largest party in the Commons - has called for a ring-fenced tax to fund the service, saying an extra £4bn is needed for next year and an additional £2.5bn for both 2019 and 2020.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable urged the US president to read the study, ""to find out how to fund a universal healthcare system"".Saturday's demonstration, called NHS In Crisis: Fix It Now, was organised by the People's Assembly Against Austerity and Health Campaigns Together.In a joint response to the US president, they said people had marched ""to show their love for the principles of universal and comprehensive care free at the point of use, paid for through general taxation"".They added: ""We don't agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric.""Actor and NHS campaigner Ralf Little, who was at the march, told President Trump he was wrong about the reasons for the march.The UK government says NHS funding ""is at a record high"" with an extra £2.8bn pledged for the service in the Budget.Mr Farage said the NHS was ""at breaking point due to a population crisis"", adding: ""We haven't got enough hospitals, doctors or facilities to cope.""The British television presenter Piers Morgan, who calls President Trump a friend and who interviewed him last week, did not agree with the tweet:Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, responded during an appearance before a committee of MPs.""President Trump has been tweeting about the National Health Service today, and unfortunately, respectfully, we suggest that tweet got the wrong end of the stick,"" he said.""And, in fact, people in this country don't want to ditch our NHS, not withstanding what we've said today, they want to keep it and strengthen it,"" he said.Mr Stevens invited the president to visit UK hospitals when he comes to the UK, ""and go away understanding that healthcare for everybody delivered at half the cost of the US healthcare system is something that people in this country are deeply and rightly committed to""."
2018-02-05,Stagecoach East Coast deal to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42945709,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowStagecoach's contract to run the East Coast Mainline rail franchise will end earlier than expected after the government said the operator had ""got its numbers wrong"".Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"".He said the government may step in to run the service.  He added that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected.The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express.It was reprivatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government £3.3bn to run the service.Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%.In November, the Department for Transport said Stagecoach and Virgin would withdraw from running the service three years early, in 2020, after running into difficulties.But on Monday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons the situation was now ""much more urgent"" and that new arrangements were needed ""in the very near future"".Mr Grayling said he was considering two approaches.One option was to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort.Mr Grayling said: ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" East Coast decision investigated by watchdog'Indefensible' deal over East Coast railPlan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by governmentLabour former transport secretary Lord Adonis accused Mr Grayling of ""undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers"".He said: ""The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company.""However Mr Grayling insisted that there was ""no question of a bailout"" for the company, adding: ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full.""He said Stagecoach was set to lose about £200m, equating to more than 20% of its total market value.Mr Grayling said: ""It should also act as a stark warning to any company tempted to over-bid in future.""At the same time, Mr Grayling also announced that another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin had won an extension to operate the West Coast Mainline rail service between London and Glasgow. He said that this joint venture will operate the West Coast Mainline from 1 April 2018 until potentially 31 March 2020.A Stagecoach subsidiary is also on the shortlist of bidders hoping to operate the East Midlands franchise, scheduled to begin in August 2019.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""That Chris Grayling awarded a profitable contract to Virgin and Stagecoach on the West Coast while simultaneously confirming the same companies have collapsed on the East Coast shows Government policy is in chaos.""This is yet another Tory handout to private shareholders at the public's expense. Failing train companies should not be awarded future contracts, but this government is rewarding them for failure by extending their lucrative deal.""Mick Whelan, leader of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""It is outrageous that Virgin Trains has been handed a lucrative new contract to run services on the West Coast Mainline despite serious criticism of its owners' handling of the East Coast franchise.""Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said: ""A lot has been said and written in the past few months about Virgin Trains East Coast - a lot of it has been misinformed and much of it has been politically motivated.""He said Stagecoach and Virgin had delivered for passengers, employees and the economy including generating payments to the taxpayer of more than £800m.""The reality is that we've neither walked away from the East Coast franchise  nor have we received or asked for any special treatment,"" he said.There are no legal grounds to prevent Stagecoach from bidding for current or future franchises, Mr Grayling told the Commons."
2018-02-05,'Significant gaps' at Stormont talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-42938391,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSignificant gaps remain in talks to restore devolution in Northern Ireland, the DUP has said.Northern Ireland has been without a power-sharing government for a year, after a coalition led by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin collapsed.The five main parties were involved in talks on Monday.Speaking afterwards, the DUP's Simon Hamilton said the talks process could not be allowed ""to run on and on"".He said there must be an accommodation ""that is fair, that is balanced, that is capable of being supported by all sides and it leads to a sustainable Assembly. ""We have... huge differences between the parties on a range of key issues and we have been working through those issues,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""We've made some progress on many of those issues, but there are still big - and in some cases quite significant - gaps."" Discussions began in January in a bid to break the impasse at Stormont and restore the power-sharing executive.Secretary of State Karen Bradley is due to update the House of Commons on progress later this week.Speaking ahead of Monday's talks, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood challenged the British and Irish governments to ""wake up to the political reality"".""If both governments continue to take a hands-off approach with this process, the DUP and Sinn Féin will carry on threatening to write the obituary of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said.""They are not bystanders in our politics. It is the authority and the balance provided by the two governments, which ultimately underpins the politics of Northern Ireland.""On Sunday, the outgoing Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams said he believed a deal could be reached to restore Stormont. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, he said: ""I've every confidence in Michelle O'Neill (Sinn Féin's northern leader) in terms of her ability to make friends with the unionists and to go forward on the basis of equality.""The outgoing Sinn Féin leader said some unionists held ""very hard positions"", but others lived in the ""real world"".""They know they have to make friends with their neighbours and would have to go on,"" he said. ""It is not about us any more, it is about the next generation.""Last week, Ms Bradley was questioned by MPs about progress in the Stormont talks. She appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster on Wednesday and provided an update on the ongoing negotiations at Stormont.The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland, David Sterling, told MPs there needs to be clarity about a budget by 8 February."
2018-02-05,Call for new tax to fund the NHS,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-42940433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA new ring-fenced tax to fund the NHS and social care has been proposed by a panel of health experts.The panel, set up by the Liberal Democrats, says the NHS in England should be given an extra £4bn on top of inflation in the next financial year.It has suggested replacing National Insurance with the new tax to close the funding gap.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said NHS funding ""is at a record high"".""[It] was prioritised in the Budget with an extra £2.8bn, on top of the additional £2bn already provided for social care over the next three years, and an additional £437m of funding for winter,"" the spokesperson said.The future of NHS money has been hotly debated as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources.Last month, tens of thousands of non-urgent operations were delayed.The 10-member panel included former NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson, Peter Carter, former chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing and Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs.It said on top of the £4bn extra needed for next year, an additional £2.5bn would be required for both 2019 and 2020. Prof Gerada said that one of the issues is that working people over the age of 60 benefit from a significantly reduced National Insurance contribution, and people over 65 do not pay it at all. She said National Insurance, which currently funds the NHS and social care, is inadequate as older people are living longer, and not contributing to the ring-fenced tax.She said: ""Old age is now between 85 and 95, so old age has significantly moved. ""Why shouldn't I pay for my fair share of contributions if I'm working?"" As part of the recommendations, the panel also suggested reinstating a cap on the costs paid by individuals on social care.In December, the government scrapped proposals to cap fees at £72,500.It supported creating an office for budget responsibility for health and called for a series of incentives to get people to save more towards their adult social care.The idea of a levy dedicated to funding the NHS was also suggested by former minister Nick Boles."

He said as far as he was concerned the matter was now over.Mr Kelly said he had been at the gym early in the morning and discovered his car had been clamped as he was leaving.He said he tried to contact the clamping company, but had been unable to speak to anyone. The MLA said he had been due to attend political talks at Stormont and ""made a decision, almost on the spur of the moment"" to remove the clamp.He said he went back into the gym and borrowed bolt cutters they used to open lockers, telling staff he had a small problem with his car.""I did what I did, I regret doing it and I haven't done it before,"" Mr Kelly said.""I shouldn't be above the law and neither should anybody else.""He said he had agreed to pay a fine of £150 to the clamping company, as well as £50 for damage to the clamp.Clamping in Northern IrelandThe Department for Infrastructure (DfI) is responsible for the enforcement of most parking restrictions.Clamping and removal are used when parking tickets have not been paid.But the department has no responsibility when it comes to private land, such as a retail park, hospital or supermarket.Landowners can set their own rules and hire firms to police their parking restrictions.When it comes to clamping and towing on private land, Northern Ireland is out on its own.The Protection of Freedoms Act outlawed the practice in England and Wales in 2012. It has been banned in Scotland since 1992.But in Gerry Kelly's case, there is another law at play - the Criminal Damage (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, which means you cannot damage other people's property ""without lawful excuse"".  Clamping and criminal damage has been tested in the courts elsewhere.In 1991, a motorist in England was found guilty of causing criminal damage to property after he forcibly removed a clamp from his car in a private car park. His defence was that he had a lawful excuse for cutting the padlocks in that wheel-clamping was a trespass to his car, and under the principle of the ""recaption of goods"" he was entitled to recover his car.However, a year later, a Scottish appeal court called clamping ""extortion and theft"". ""The act of depriving the motorist of the use of his car by detaining it against his will can accurately be described as stealing something from him,"" one of the judges said.Mr Kelly said he had gone to the police to tell them what had happened, but that as far as he was concerned the matter was now over.As well as being an assembly member, the 64-year-old is also Sinn Féin's policing spokesperson. He is also a former member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board, which holds the PSNI to account.His actions were criticised by other political parties.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said it was a ""significant test for the Sinn Féin leadership"".Mr Dodds asked: ""Will Gerry Adams, Mary Lou McDonald or Michelle O'Neill finally take action when we have their policing spokesperson act like this?""Nobody's holding their breath.""The leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), Jim Allister, also criticised Mr Kelly.""He, who sat on the Policing Board, pontificating about law and order issues, should now think that he can take the law into his own hands and behave in this manner, needs to be called to account. The incident happened near the Metropolitan Arts Centre (MAC)."
2018-02-05,"UK will leave customs union, No 10 insists",https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42938672,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDowning Street has insisted Britain will leave the EU customs union after Brexit amid claims of Tory disunity over the UK-EU future relationship.Theresa May has faced calls to spell out what she wants from the talks ahead of the UK's departure in March 2019.In a customs union the UK would have tariff-free trade within the EU, but would lose the ability to strike its own deals with other countries.It comes ahead of a meeting with the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier.The prime minister and Brexit Secretary David Davis will meet Mr Barnier ahead of the next round of negotiations getting under way.Later, talks between officials will focus for the first time on the transitional period planned for after Brexit.Potential sticking points include citizens' rights, with the UK insisting EU nationals arriving during this time should not have the same rights as those who arrived before Brexit day.As he set off for London, Mr Barnier said there was ""not a moment to lose"" in order to secure a deal before the end of the year.Asked about the UK's position on the customs union, he said Downing Street's ""red lines"" would be respected but the UK must respect the ""rules of the union"". How close the UK will remain to the EU's single market and customs union has been a topic of debate among leading Brexiteers and some of those closest to the prime minister.Conservative MP Kwasi Kwarteng, who is an aide to Chancellor Philip Hammond, suggested the latest statement on the customs union was ""perfectly consistent"" with what No 10 had been saying all along, given that Mrs May had been ""pretty clear"" in her January 2017 Lancaster House speech the UK would be leaving.Pressed on how he squared this reality with Mr Hammond's stated desire for the UK and EU to move ""very modestly"" apart in terms of trade, he told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""being modestly apart does not mean you have to be in a customs union"". He said the government had to make it clearer its core aim was a free trade deal with the EU. On Sunday Eurosceptic Tory Bernard Jenkin accused the government of being ""vague"" and ""divided"", saying Chancellor Philip Hammond was not sticking to the approach put forward by the prime minister.Home Secretary Amber Rudd - who was a leading figure in the Remain campaign - played down the divisions in the cabinet, telling the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""I have a surprise for the Brexiteers, which is the committee that meets in order to help make these decisions is more united than they think.""Future options?In a position paper published in August, the UK set out two potential options for future long-term customs operations.A ""partnership"" arrangement would see the UK ""align precisely"" with the EU in terms of imports and exports, removing the need for any customs checks between the two.The UK would continue to operate its own checks on goods coming from outside the EU - and safeguards would be needed to prevent goods entering the EU that had not complied with its rules.An alternative scenario would involve the UK extending customs checks to EU arrivals but under a ""highly streamlined arrangement"" to minimise disruption at ports and airports.This would seek to make the existing system of customs checks ""even more efficient"", for example using number plate recognition technology at ports, which could be linked to customs declarations for what the vehicles are carrying, meaning the vehicles do not have to be manually stopped and checked.Ms Rudd said they agreed on the need for ""frictionless trade"", the ability to strike international trade deals and to avoid a hard border in Ireland, hitting back at those who question whether such a deal can be secured.""We want to have a bespoke agreement,"" she said. ""Now we're not going to surrender before we have that battle.""She said Mrs May - who will chair a meeting of the 10-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee on Wednesday and Thursday - had an ""open mind"" on how customs will be managed after Brexit. Quizzed on what the model might look like, she said she was ""not intimidated at all"" by critics' warnings about customs unions membership.Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said. "

Between a fifth and a third of our graduates take non-graduate jobs. ""The 'graduate premium' varies wildly according to subject and institution. For many, the returns are paltry.""The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don'tAt the Centre for Social Justice, he will say there is an ""enormous opportunity in rebalancing higher education"" and a strong need for intermediate skills. ""There are skills shortages in several sectors. And there are millions of people who want to get on in life - preferably without a lead weight of £50,000 dragging from their feet,"" he adds.He suggests: ""If we are going to continue to lavishly furnish universities with taxpayers' money, we need to think about how universities can specialise in these areas. ""Existing universities that do not provide a good return on academic courses could reinvent themselves as centres of technical excellence.""His comments come as the latest University and College Admissions Service figures show a small drop in the number of people applying to higher education in the UK. Last year 559,030 people, including foreign students, applied to UK universities. This is the lowest number since 2014. A breakdown shows that there were 12,420 fewer UK applicants, a 2.6% drop compared to last year. It is the second annual drop in a row.Most of this comes from a drop in 18 and 19-year-olds submitting applications, accounting for 70% of the fall in UK applicants, according to Ucas.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, umbrella organisation for universities, said: ""This small drop in applicant figures can be attributed largely to the fall in the number of 18-year-olds across the UK population. ""This group makes up half of all UK applicants to universities. But the demand for courses from 18-year-olds across the UK remains strong, highlighting the continued demand for university education.""A spokesman for UUK said: ""Official figures are clear that, on average, university graduates continue to earn substantially more than non-graduates and are more likely to be in employment. A university degree remains an excellent investment.""We must, however, be careful to avoid using graduate salaries as the single measure of success in higher education. Many universities specialise in fields such as the arts, the creative industries, nursing and public sector professions that, despite making an essential contribution to society and the economy, pay less on average.""But there has been growing concern about the amount of debt students are accumulating and the interest being charged on that debt.The government has promised a review of higher education funding in England in response.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said legislation had been introduced to reform higher education to ensure that students and the taxpayer got value for money. ""The government wants everyone to be equipped with the skills they need to get on in life and succeed in the jobs of the future,"" the spokesperson said."

""Now it is saying it is in grave danger of not doing that. This demonstrates the collapse of financial controls at the council.""Michael Ellis, MP for Northampton North, said the situation was dire and it was ""time for a change of leadership"".The statement said the current inspection of the council, instigated last year, should conclude quickly and lead to the appointment of commissioners. ""It should be noted that the county's financial problems are self-inflicted,"" it added.The MPs - all of whom are Conservative - said they had confidence in council staff working in ""tough circumstances"" but launched a scathing attack on its leadership and cabinet.Backbench county councillors, it said, were capable of driving the council forward ""if only they were given the opportunity to do so"" but were ""undermined"" by cabinet members when they attempted to scrutinise decisions.""We had concerns that if the leadership of the council were giving government the same information they were giving us as MPs... then a completely incorrect picture of the council's finances would be being passed on, which in turn would undermine any legitimate ask for fairer funding,"" the statement said.For these Tory MPs to criticise this Conservative council leadership shows, along with the section 114 notice, just how serious this is.This is not just another council funding story; we are in unchartered territory with the pressure on this authority. On top of that there is the personal pressure on its leader Heather Smith.We know some of her backbench councillors share some of the views of the MPs and we will have to see how that plays out.She says the problems were caused by government underfunding, that she warned them this was going to happen and no one listened.This is a crisis that is far from over. The council announced in December that it was looking to increase council tax by almost 5% as it sought to make savings of £34.3m and revealed in January it was considering selling its new £53m headquarters, which officially opened in October.It is the first section 114 notice - a provision of the Local Government Finance Act - issued in about 20 years."

The Tory-led committee's strongly worded report - called Sunset for the Royal Marines? - warns the rumoured cuts would weaken one of Britain's elite fighting forces.""Given the disproportionate contribution the Royal Marines make to defence and the sheer range and versatility of their military skills, both they and the country's security would be significantly undermined,"" they said.They also said slashing its two amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark - used to carry out beach landings - would ""put the interests of this country at serious risk"".The former head of the Royal Navy, Lord West, said the UK's ""capability will have been cut by a half"" since 2010 if the cuts go ahead.""I don't think the British people realise what cuts the military have had,"" he said.Theresa May and Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson are understood to have both rejected the cost-cutting proposals before Christmas, but concern over funding remains.Last month, Mr Williamson announced a new review, the Defence Modernisation Programme, focusing solely on military defence. Mr Williamson has indicated he will demand more money if the review deems it necessary.""Gavin Williamson deserves credit for seizing back control of the defence dimension of the NSCR (National Security Capability Review) process,"" said Defence Select Committee chair Julian Lewis. ""But, ultimately, he will fail without extra funding from the Treasury.""If the ships were lost ""the heart would be torn out of our amphibious capability"", Mr Lewis added.The Tory MP told the BBC: ""The Treasury has got to cough up.""  In December, analysis by the House of Commons Library found that between 2010 and 2015 the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) budget had fallen by £8bn in real terms.Since then, spending has stabilised and in the last financial year (April 2016 - March 2017), £35.3bn was spent on defence.In 2016, the UK had the fifth biggest defence budget  - the highest of all EU countries - according to an international military study.Mr Lewis added that recent years had seen ""new and intensified threats"" and the UK should not be ""deleting one of our world-beating capabilities"".The MPs' report also said cuts to the Royal Marines since 2011 had already led to ""a tangible drop in morale"" and ""particular embarrassment"" during exercises with the UK's allies.In response to the report, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said the Royal Marines ""play a vital role"" in defending the country.""Just last week we launched the Modernising Defence Programme to strengthen our Armed Forces in the face of intensifying threats,"" he said.""Our brand new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is central to our efforts to build an Armed Forces fit for the future and is a symbol of our intent to remain a truly Global Britain.""The £3.1bn HMS Queen Elizabeth was unveiled in 2017.

Number 10 will have cheered some of their Brexit backing troops this morning by ruling out, (again), staying in the customs union. This time they have, for good measure and just to be clear, ruled out not just staying in 'the' customs union, but also remaining in 'a' customs union. This might sound bonkers to you, but the inclusion of 'a' as a mere possibility had given hope to some MPs that the government was open to the idea of essentially replicating the current arrangements and calling it something else. An explicit reminder in those terms therefore will be a frustration to that group which have been pushing for a softer approach. In political terms therefore, it is an important signal at the beginning of an important week. What Sunday's late night statement is not, however, is anything like a new explanation of what the government actually wants to do. It does not mean that there will definitely be a border on the island of Ireland. It does not mean definitely that there will suddenly be vast lorry parks across the whole of Kent or around the ports at Hull or Holyhead. The government's overall aims remain the same - no hard border, and trade that is as frictionless as possible after Brexit. But there are emerging signs of the 'c' - the compromise that Theresa May will try to broker with her party, and her cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks to establish the government's actual position. That is, before of course, Brussels and 27 other countries either say ""oui"", ""non"", or ""peut-etre"". Back in the summer the UK set out two broad possibilities. The fault line that Theresa May needs to walk carefully over this week is between those in her cabinet who want to crack on as fast as possible with agreeing trade deals with other countries, and those who put the preservation of the existing arrangements above that. As we saw last week on her trade trip to China, the prime minister does not want to accept publicly that one of these choices trumps the other. But as her colleagues who toured the broadcast studios yesterday displayed, there are divisions in the Tory party over who wants what, so there does have to be compromise.There are whispers around, as The Times reports, that putting a time limit on to some of the existing arrangements could provide a way through. Interestingly, that's the approach that eventually found favour between Westminster and Brussels over another of the points of contention. The UK accepted that the European courts would continue to have a role in enforcing the rights of EU nationals who live in the UK, but for a time-limited period of 8 years. That gave the PM enough wriggle room to contain the wishes of the rest of the EU and her party. Senior figures in Number 10 suggested then the idea of putting time limits could be a useful precedent for other parts of the deal. This could, perhaps, therefore provide one of the routes out of this tangled part of the Brexit talks. But there are still weeks and months of talking ahead to do. "
2018-02-05,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-42908222,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThis week, MPs voted to move out of their iconic Victorian home, the Palace of Westminster, for five years or more, to allow for vital ""Restoration and Renewal"" work. Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject. If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out. At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position  of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed. Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap. Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down. Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part. MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn. Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.    But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example. It is going to be a long time before the builders move in. First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done. Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures. In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable. We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.  The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall.  This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future. Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network. It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap. A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law. A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates.

2018-02-05,EU's thinking,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42922796,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth £625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy.  The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO.  There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet.For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March. "

However, the fact it was a former prime minister who first introduced him to the name is a nice tale.""I first heard of him from Margaret Thatcher can you believe, when I had my own fit of youthful endeavour in politics as a 16 year old, giving a speech at the Tory Party Conference in 1977,"" said the former Conservative leader. ""I was hauled off to meet Margaret Thatcher and she said to the assembled press: 'We could be standing here with another William Pitt' and I had no idea who that was, and I thought I'd better find out and as I did - over the next 20 years - I became quite an admirer.William Pitt the Younger, so styled because his father 'Pitt the Elder' had also been prime minister, was a political prodigy. He graduated from Cambridge at 17 and entered Parliament four years later in 1781. When he became prime minister he was still just 24 years old. Lord Hague said: ""He was written off at the time as a 'mince pie' prime minister, just in place for Christmas and then out, but he served for 19 years ... still our youngest and second-longest-serving prime minister"".Young Pitt was a reformer and counted the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce amongst his closest friends. While others referred to him as a Tory, he always maintained he was an independent. William Hague is profuse in his praise.""He seemed to me to be an undervalued figure in history, that his name would come up in an episode of Black Adder, as a figure of fun ... Actually he was a towering figure, who stood alone against Napoleon, who plotted naval strategy with Nelson, he dealt with the most extraordinary range of circumstances"" .Pitt had become prime minister when Britain was still reeling from the loss of its American colonies.  With the national debt spiralling upward ""Honest Billy"", as he was sometimes called in the press, set about steadying the ship. Later in his career he would introduce both income tax and the first paper money, not backed by actual gold. They were steps that didn't always make him popular, but as Lord Hague argues, they did produce results,""This was much mocked at the time ... but his keeping the country creditworthy, the inexhaustible credit of the City of London and Britain ... allowed it to overcome Napoleon in the end, because France they said could almost never run out of men, but Britain would never run out of money"". Pitt's rivalry with the French emperor would come to define his premiership.Despite his success, Pitt was famously aloof and even shy. He never married and his devotion to his country consumed his life. His drinking contributed to his death at just 46 years old. Former foreign secretary Lord Hague, who himself became party leader at the relatively young age of 36, feel some sympathy for him. ""Becoming so powerful so early in life, actually stunted his development as a human being in other ways because you don't make new friends or interests if you are at the heart of government ... I think all of us who are in those situations experience a bit of what William Pitt did ... but most of us leave at some point, he never did"".Lord Hague reserves his greatest admiration for Pitt the orator and parliamentarian,""He really gave full vent to his personality in Parliament and this is an age where the House of Commons had in it: Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, William Wilberforce, this is an age that makes today's Parliament look pedestrian in the extreme and he was the equal, if not the master, of them all.""William Pitt left office in 1801, but was prime minister again by 1804 and, despite warnings from his doctors that his work might kill him, he refused to leave his post and died as prime minister in 1806.In the end he was, Lord Hague said: ""The pilot who weathered the storm.""This interview is one of a series on politicians' political heroes, to be broadcast on the BBC's Daily Politics on Fridays."
2018-02-05,Women's outrage,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-42875095,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRecently rediscovered 100-year-old posters showing the struggle for votes for women are going on show for the first time.  They pull no punches in their depiction of the strength of feeling among the women who fought for equal rights.Addressed simply to ""the Librarian"", a bundle wrapped in plain brown paper was delivered to Cambridge University Library sometime around 1910, and it took over 100 years for the contents of the parcel to be rediscovered, in 2016, preserved in their original wrapping.Underneath the faded paper was one of the largest surviving collections of suffrage posters from the early 20th Century. They had been sent by a leading figure of the suffrage movement, Marion Phillips, who became Labour MP for Sunderland in 1929. It is unclear why Phillips sent the posters.""They were created to be plastered on walls, torn down by weather or political opponents,"" says Chris Burgess, exhibitions officer at the library. ""So it is highly unusual for this material to be safely stored.""gThe posters going on show to mark the centenary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act, which gave the vote to women over the age of 30.Because of Cambridge's prestigious university, local suffrage posters often featured women in academic dress. Artists observed that the city's educated women were still grouped - in the eyes of the law - with the likes of convicts and lunatics.Although Cambridge's women-only colleges such as Girton and Newnham had very active suffrage societies, the university itself was far from progressive.By the end of the 19th Century, women were allowed to study at the university but were not given full degrees at the end of their studies. When an 1897 vote proposed to change this, there was outrage. An effigy of a lady cyclist - a symbol of the new woman - was torn down and destroyed to the delight of the jeering crowds of male students.Posters also tried to appeal to working-class women, such as those working in textile factories or at home as seamstresses.Some pointed out that these women were not even able to vote on laws that concerned women's regulations and rights. This meant men were voting on what they believed to be best for women.Lucy Delap, a historian specialising in this period, says most people in the UK were against women getting the vote. As a result, ""the suffrage movement definitely had to reach out to many women"".""Campaigning went far beyond the simple equality message - to point out how the vote could make a difference in households, at work, on the streets - matters that concerned all women,"" she says. Print production was central to the suffrage campaigns. ""People would be cranking out handbills to be distributed the same day through networks of sash-wearing volunteers, or printing posters advertising meetings taking place that same evening,"" says Delap. To appeal to the widest audience, Delap says, the suffrage posters took inspiration from the tabloids, using eye-catching headlines, large cartoons and photographs.And the suffragists were media-savvy political campaigners - reacting to the policies of the day. In 1909, there was a national outcry when Home Secretary Herbert Gladstone ordered that imprisoned protestors on hunger strike should be force-fed. John Bull - a fictional figure commonly used to personify the UK, and England in particular - is depicted in the image above. Without the help of a woman, he is struggling alone with children and housework, visual metaphors for the social problems of the Edwardian era.This poster suggests if women could vote, then problems including infant mortality, poor schooling and unemployment might more easily be solved for the benefit of everyone. ""Handicapped"" was one of the most popular posters of the suffrage campaign, painted by Bloomsbury Group artist Duncan Grant.It shows a young privileged man being easily propelled forwards by votes, while a woman struggles on choppier waters in a simple row boat.Mrs Partington was another familiar figure used by the UK press at the time. She was usually seen trying to stem progress with her mop. In this case, she is trying to stop the seeming flood of support for women's votes.The poster below called for support for political organisations - listed on the children's bibs - to be withdrawn until women were able to participate at the ballot box. Some posters explicitly call for ""law-abiding"" meetings. Delap says the movement was split over whether more violent action was needed.""There were militants who were willing to break the law: smashing windows, destroying golf courses, burning buildings,"" she says.""There were also non-violent actions that broke the law - refusing to fill in the census, refusing to pay tax without representation - a range of creative tactics.""But just to stand on a box in the marketplace, as many women did, provoked public fury, peltings with rotten vegetables and even police brutality. ""To be a female suffrage activist of any kind was a militant act.""  Our Weapon is Public Opinion: Posters of the Women's Suffrage Movement is on display at Cambridge University Library from 3 February."
2018-02-05,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-05,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180205210542/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Other ways in which the anniversary is being marked include:Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society and relatives of the suffragettes are among those who called on the home secretary to overturn the convictions of women who were imprisoned while fighting for the vote.Emmeline Pankhurst, a founder member of the Woman's Social and Political Union, and leading suffragettes Emily Davison and Flora Drummond were some of the women jailed during the campaign for women's votes.Ms Davison was found guilty of placing a ""dangerous substance likely to injure"" in a post office letter box outside Parliament and sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison.By Francesca Gillett, BBC News Women and men of all ages gathered outside the pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday morning.In freezing temperatures, the passers-by stopped to look at the cardboard cut-outs of 59 campaigners involved in the women's suffrage movement, many of whom are unknown faces.""We forget these women,"" said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague.""I do think it's quite poignant. You almost want to stand in with them to be part of it and to be one of these women.""University professor Hazel Barrett, whose grandmother supported the suffragette movement, said people of all classes got involved, adding: ""Just look at them, ordinary women"".Sheree Davey, who came with her young son to see the display, said: ""It's incredible. It inspires you to learn a bit more. ""You know the basics but there's so much more to it."" Victoria Taylor, a tourist visiting from Australia, said: ""It's a great way to engage people. It's not confronting but it's very prominent.""Records compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed.Labour leader Mr Corbyn said his party would give pardons if it came to power as convictions of suffregettes were ""politically motivated and bore no relation to the acts committed"".He added: ""Labour in government will both pardon the suffragettes and give an official apology for the miscarriages of justice and wider persecution they suffered.""The Scottish Tory leader said she supported calls for posthumous pardons for the convicted women as they were simply ""righting the wrong"" of of an unjust law.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Ruth Davidson said: ""Voting was a value judgement, not an intrinsic right. That inequality is one reason why I support calls by family members to offer a posthumous pardon to those suffragettes charged with righting that wrong.""Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said pardons would be a ""fitting tribute"". Ms Rudd, who is also minister for women and equalities, said she would consider the issue.However, she told Radio 4's Today Programme: ""I must be frank, it is complicated because if you're going to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence it's not as straightforward as people think it might be.""Today feels a bit like feminist Christmas in the House of Commons pic.twitter.com/9Ceo07hfrhEnd of Twitter post  by @jessphillipsRadio 4's Woman's Hour celebrated the 100th anniversary by broadcasting the show from the Pankhurst Centre in Manchester, the birthplace of Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragette movement. During the programme Jenni Murray interviewed Britain's second female Prime Minister Theresa May, whose late godmother was a suffragette.Mrs May said getting the vote was ""the first step"" for women to be involved ""properly in public life"".  She said: ""It was the point at which women were able to start to feel that they could bring their experience, their views, their opinions, into the world of public life.""Meanwhile, as a tribute to the suffragettes, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a £500,000 fund to encourage more women to become involved in politics.A debate will also take place at the Scottish parliament later celebrating 100 years of female suffrage.The prime minister will also use her speech in Manchester to warn that online abuse and intimidation is threatening democracy.She will say online abuse of political candidates and representatives is often targeted at women, gay people and members of ethnic minorities.""In the face of what is a threat to our democracy, I believe that all of us - individuals, governments, and media old and new - must accept our responsibility to help sustain a genuinely pluralist public debate for the future,"" she will say.Mrs May will announce plans for a Law Commission review of legislation to ensure that illegal actions are also illegal online.She told Radio 4 that the government is consulting on a ""new offence of intimidation of parliamentary candidates and campaigners"".She said: ""I think we also see sadly, women often suffering bullying and harassment on social media and this is across the political spectrum. ""In my party Esther McVey has particularly suffered with this but Luciana Berger on the Labour benches has suffered from this,"" Mrs May said.6 February 1918 - The Representation of the People Act is passed giving women aged over 30 and ""of property"" the vote 21 November 1918 - The Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act is passed and allows women to stand for Parliament14 December 1918 - Women vote in a general election for the first time1928 - The Equal Franchise Act is passed and all women aged over 21 can now vote30 May 1929 - Women aged between 21 and 29 vote for the first time"
2018-02-06,The journey towards 50-50,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42945323,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIf my five-year-old self had been told that my great-grandmothers weren't allowed to vote, I'd have thought that was pretty daft. I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."

They have taken down Major, they took down Cameron, two great leaders neither of whom stood up to them.""The former minister added that she is prepared to leave her party unless Theresa May challenges her opponents. ""If it comes to it I am not going to stay in a party which has been taken over by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson. They are not proper Conservatives.""She added: ""Unless Theresa stands up and sees off these people she is in real danger of losing huge swathes of not just the parliamentary party but the Conservative party. ""That is the risk that she runs. She thinks she can pander to 35 forgetting there is a much larger group who are getting sick and tired of this.""Ms Soubry was speaking as the Brexit cabinet sub committee prepares to meet on Wednesday and Thursday this week to draw up a UK negotiating position on its future relationship with the EU. On Monday Downing Street reiterated its decision to withdraw from the EU customs union and not to join a watered down customs union with the EU.Ministers instead want to negotiate a separate customs arrangement or customs partnership. Downing Street says this is the only way to allow the UK to sign future trade deals around the world while seeking to maintain frictionless trade with the EU.Ms Soubry told Newsnight: ""Frankly people have got to grow some, get a spine, stiffen up, stand up to these people - most of them are ghastly bullies but also cowards at the same time - and speak up for their constituents and what is right for our country. ""And if that means leaving the party, form some new alliance, God knows I don't know. But we just simply cannot go on like this any longer.""Asked about Ms Soubry's intervention, the pro-Brexit Lord Lamont said: ""I think that is quite ridiculous frankly. ""I don't want to be rude about Anna Soubry but she does tend sometimes to go over the top. I think she is doing that here."""

Ms Price, who is appearing before the Commons Petitions Committee, says she wants to introduce legislation called Harvey's Law to give people extra protection.She said of her son's experiences: ""Harvey was getting racial abuse, they were mocking him ... putting him on t-shirts, and he's got complex special needs - I've got five children but they always pick on him.""""He cannot speak for himself but I can,"" she told the BBC's Daily Politics. ""I have two had people arrested by the police - they took it as far as they could but they could not charge them with anything because there is absolutely nothing in place.""So I thought, I am going to do something about this.""She said freedom of speech was important but there had to be a line and it was not just people with disabilities who needed protection, ""it could be anyone"". ""I am going to fight as much as I can to get online abuse a criminal offence,"" she said and added that she was counting on MPs to ""put a case together, and believe in me, and take it to the next step so it is a discussion in government"".The Petitions Committee is looking at the impact of online abuse - particularly on people with disabilities - responsibility for protection, whether technology companies are doing enough.It is also examining whether the law needs to be changed, how to define online abuse and what support is given to victims."

The key focus of my time in the role was to bring net debt down.""In a stormy committee session, Mr Khan also said he ""spooked the board"" when he reviewed the company's contracts.But former Carillion chief executive Keith Cochrane has told MPs that was not the reason for Mr Khan's dismissal.Mr Cochrane accepted that Mr Khan's findings were correct but told the committee: ""Our concern was whether he was fully on top of all the cashflow arrangements and close to what was actually happening.""He added that Mr Khan's dismissal happened at the same time as other senior management changes.Mr Cochrane, who only took charge last July, said he was ""truly sorry"" about the company's collapse.""It was the worst possible outcome. This was a business worth fighting for. That's what I sought to do during my time as chief executive,"" he said.The previous chief executive Richard Howson ran the company for six years before stepping down after a profit warning.Mr Howson told the committee that towards the end of his time in the role, he ""felt like a bailiff just to try and collect cash"".He added: ""The amount of energy and effort to make sure there is enough cashflow each month is extraordinary.""Mr Howson said he believed the company was ""run well"" but highlighted some of the difficulties in bringing in money owed to the company.He described a job in Qatar for which Carillion was owed around £200m at the time he was replaced by Mr Cochrane and which has now been put back until the end of this year.And he also spoke about the building of the Royal Liverpool Hospital which seemed completed until cracked beams were discovered.Carillion employed 43,000 people, including around 20,000 in the UK.This month alone, more than 800 job losses have been announced and Mr Cochrane said: ""Do I wish we'd done something about it sooner? Absolutely. ""Clearly with the benefit of hindsight should the board have been asking further, more probing questions? Perhaps.""  "
2018-02-06,Stagecoach East Coast deal to end early,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42945709,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowStagecoach's contract to run the East Coast Mainline rail franchise will end earlier than expected after the government said the operator had ""got its numbers wrong"".Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"".He said the government may step in to run the service.  He added that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected.The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express.It was reprivatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government £3.3bn to run the service.Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%.In November, the Department for Transport said Stagecoach and Virgin would withdraw from running the service three years early, in 2020, after running into difficulties.But on Monday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons the situation was now ""much more urgent"" and that new arrangements were needed ""in the very near future"".Mr Grayling said he was considering two approaches.One option was to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort.Mr Grayling said: ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" East Coast decision investigated by watchdog'Indefensible' deal over East Coast railPlan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by governmentLabour former transport secretary Lord Adonis accused Mr Grayling of ""undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers"".He said: ""The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company.""However Mr Grayling insisted that there was ""no question of a bailout"" for the company, adding: ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full.""He said Stagecoach was set to lose about £200m, equating to more than 20% of its total market value.Mr Grayling said: ""It should also act as a stark warning to any company tempted to over-bid in future.""At the same time, Mr Grayling also announced that another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin had won an extension to operate the West Coast Mainline rail service between London and Glasgow. He said that this joint venture will operate the West Coast Mainline from 1 April 2018 until potentially 31 March 2020.A Stagecoach subsidiary is also on the shortlist of bidders hoping to operate the East Midlands franchise, scheduled to begin in August 2019.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""That Chris Grayling awarded a profitable contract to Virgin and Stagecoach on the West Coast while simultaneously confirming the same companies have collapsed on the East Coast shows Government policy is in chaos.""This is yet another Tory handout to private shareholders at the public's expense. Failing train companies should not be awarded future contracts, but this government is rewarding them for failure by extending their lucrative deal.""Mick Whelan, leader of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""It is outrageous that Virgin Trains has been handed a lucrative new contract to run services on the West Coast Mainline despite serious criticism of its owners' handling of the East Coast franchise.""Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said: ""A lot has been said and written in the past few months about Virgin Trains East Coast - a lot of it has been misinformed and much of it has been politically motivated.""He said Stagecoach and Virgin had delivered for passengers, employees and the economy including generating payments to the taxpayer of more than £800m.""The reality is that we've neither walked away from the East Coast franchise  nor have we received or asked for any special treatment,"" he said.There are no legal grounds to prevent Stagecoach from bidding for current or future franchises, Mr Grayling told the Commons."
2018-02-06,Armed forces paralysis due to Brexit - Rusi,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42956296,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA government preoccupation with Brexit has led to ""policy paralysis"" over the armed forces, a think tank is warning.The Royal United Services Institute said delays over implementing planned military reductions, including the axing of some warships, aircraft and regiments, had created uncertainty. Rusi said the UK was risking its reputation as an international partner.The Ministry of Defence says its review, to be concluded by the summer, will strengthen the armed forces.Rusi's warning comes as the Ministry of Defence faces a budget shortfall of up to £20bn over the next 10 years.  A defence review was due to be published early this year which could have led to significant cuts in the armed forces.     BBC Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale said the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has managed to buy the MoD more time as he tries to persuade the Treasury to give his department more money.  But Rusi's report says any further delay in making those decisions risks damaging Britain's standing with key allies. It argues that by extending the defence review and with the media focus on possible cuts to ""totemic"" units like the Marines there is now a greater danger to the UK's ""credibility as a serious security actor"".The think-tank says the government has a ""positive story to tell"" with defence spending due to be 5% higher in real terms in 2020-21 compared to 2015-16.But Rusi said the MoD promised more than it could realistically afford and this year's review is having to address this.It added:  ""The government is increasingly perceived to be unable to make difficult decisions, distracted by Brexit and unable to play an international role that is commensurate with the resources it devotes to this purpose. ""The longer this policy paralysis continues, the greater the risk to the UK's reputation as a reliable ally, and the stronger the (unfair) perception that it is no longer capable of being a serious security player. ""With talks on the EU's future relationship with the UK approaching a critical moment, this is not a helpful message."" "
2018-02-06,Barnier's Brexit trade warning to UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42945605,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK will face ""unavoidable"" barriers to trade if it leaves the customs union and single market, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said.Speaking in Downing Street, he said the ""time had come"" for the UK to choose what it wanted after its 2019 exit.Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK's position was ""perfectly clear"".The UK, he argued, wanted a free trade deal with the EU but also the freedom to strike deals with other countries, where trade opportunities were growing. ""There's no doubt about it. We are leaving the customs union but we are aiming for a good future for Britain,"" Mr Davis said.He also said he was confident the two sides would reach an agreement on a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" phase - to last between 18 months and two years after the UK leaves next year - in time for an EU summit at the end of March.After lunch with Mr Davis and a 20-minute meeting with Theresa May, Mr Barnier said there was ""some divergence"" between the two sides when it came to issues relating to transition and how the exit deal would be enforced.While he said he respected the UK's decision to rule out any form of long-term customs union and other so-called ""red lines"", he said it was a prerequisite of any deal that ""everyone plays by the same rules"" during the transition period - where the UK would have to comply with existing EU laws and regulations.He said he wanted greater clarity from the UK about what ultimate partnership it wanted with the EU after its departure, expressing his hope an ""official position"" would be put forward soon.""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice.""The government's 11-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and Thursday as UK officials prepare to brief their EU counterparts on their vision for post-Brexit relations on Friday. At the same time, there will be initial discussions on the ""transitional"" period as well as efforts to convert the details of December's agreement on the Irish border, citizens' rights and money into a legal framework. Ahead of this, Downing Street ruled out any form of customs union with the EU, which would give the UK access to tariff-free trade within the bloc but mean it cannot negotiate its own deals with other countries.Downing Street said the government had set out two potential alternatives last summer - a new customs partnership without the need for any customs checks and a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement in which EU arrivals would be subject to customs checks but in a way that minimised disruption through technology.No 10 would not say which was the preferred option and said work was continuing on both proposals.Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said Switzerland was an example of a country which had both its own customs arrangements with the EU and an independent trade policy.""Britain is a global country, a world trader,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics, adding that the UK had been ""artificially penalised"" by the customs unions because it trades more outside the EU than inside.But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he found Downing Street's intervention ""rather strange"" since the UK would have to maintain some form of ""customs union or alignment"" with the EU if it was to honour the terms of its agreement to prevent any hard border on the island of Ireland.Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said.In the House of Commons, ministers faced criticism for delays in putting forward new post-Brexit immigration rules.The government has said new border controls will be brought in when EU free movement rules no longer apply, but a promised White Paper policy document has yet to be published.Businesses groups have expressed frustration at the wait for concrete proposals.And in an urgent Commons question, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""kicking the can down the road"".Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denied this, saying it was ""imperative"" that the White Paper and an immigration bill were the ""right pieces of legislation"" when they were brought to the Commons.""We will publish a White Paper in the coming months, when the time is right,"" she said."

The chief executive of NHS England said the US president had ""got the wrong end of the stick"".In the UK, the NHS is funded out of general taxation, so people do not have to pay when they get treatment. In the US, when people get treatment they have to pay, most often through health insurance providers.President Trump's tweet came after ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox And Friends, one of the president's favourite shows, talking about the weekend march.""Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care,"" Mr Trump tweeted.The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care.

Such was the case on Monday, as the president tweeted about the National Health Service shortly after former UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeared on Fox to criticise the NHS during a segment on a recent London protest march.Healthcare reform, while a major topic of partisan debate in the US last year, has fallen off the radar recently. Republicans tried, and failed, to roll back government regulation of the insurance industry instituted by Barack Obama. In last week's State of the Union address, Mr Trump barely mentioned the topic.When Fox News catches the president's attention, however, that can change with the flick of a Twitter finger.NHS funding has been hotly debated in the UK as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources.A panel set up by the Liberal Democrats - the fourth largest party in the Commons - has called for a ring-fenced tax to fund the service, saying an extra £4bn is needed for next year and an additional £2.5bn for both 2019 and 2020.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable urged the US president to read the study, ""to find out how to fund a universal healthcare system"".Saturday's demonstration, called NHS In Crisis: Fix It Now, was organised by the People's Assembly Against Austerity and Health Campaigns Together.In a joint response to the US president, they said people had marched ""to show their love for the principles of universal and comprehensive care free at the point of use, paid for through general taxation"".They added: ""We don't agree with your divisive and incorrect rhetoric.""Actor and NHS campaigner Ralf Little, who was at the march, told President Trump he was wrong about the reasons for the march.Hey matey. I was front row of that march and I can assure you that is 100% not why we were there. I can explain properly if you’ve got 5 mins to chat between rounds of golf? https://t.co/slud9VHrADEnd of Twitter post  by @RalfLittleThe UK government says NHS funding ""is at a record high"" with an extra £2.8bn pledged for the service in the Budget.Mr Farage said the NHS was ""at breaking point due to a population crisis"", adding: ""We haven't got enough hospitals, doctors or facilities to cope.""The truth is the NHS is at breaking point due to a population crisis. We haven’t got enough hospitals, doctors or facilities to cope. pic.twitter.com/wG1ux7fi23End of Twitter post  by @Nigel_FarageThe British television presenter Piers Morgan, who calls President Trump a friend and who interviewed him last week, did not agree with the tweet:Wrong, Mr President.Our NHS is a wonderful, albeit imperfect, health system - and the envy of the world.

UK Government spokesperson on the latest developments in the talks: pic.twitter.com/vSqWQlW9WyEnd of Twitter post  by @NIOgov""We have... huge differences between the parties on a range of key issues and we have been working through those issues,"" said Mr Hamilton. ""We've made some progress on many of those issues, but there are still big - and in some cases quite significant - gaps."" Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said his party had entered into the latest talks to see if a resolution was possible. ""We have made some progress, but there are still gaps there,"" he said.""This process will come to an end in the next short while and we will make a judgement then as to whether a deal is possible or not.""I would imagine we're talking days. We had said at the start, and I think everyone shares that view, that we can't have indefinite talks.""Following Monday's talks, the UK government said there was a shared commitment among the parties and good progress had been made, but difficult issues remain.""Our assessment is that an agreement in the coming days, while not certain, is achievable. Time remains short.  We all need to focus our collective efforts in the coming days on working together to form an executive,"" a spokesperson said.In a statement, the Irish government said it shared the UK government's assessment on a shared commitment ""across all parties to see the devolved institutions operating effectively in the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland"".""Time is short, but the prize is one worth stretching for,"" it said.The SDLP's Nichola Mallon said her party had believed they were going to be involved in inclusive all-party talks on Monday.""What we got today was more of the same,"" she said. ""It looks like it's going to continue to be an exclusive, two-party process with two parties with a very toxic relationship.""Ulster Unionist Steve Aiken said it was a day of ""frustration and disappointment"". ""We have seen throughout this period - over a year - we have seen absolutely no progress at all reported by the other two parties [DUP and Sinn Féin],"" he said. ""Today we had the situation where we're being asked to give them even more time and we are not being given the opportunity to discover what the DUP and Sinn Féin have been working towards."" Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said the talks were ""like groundhog day"".""I think time is very short,"" she said. ""There is an opportunity still for a deal to be done, but I think at the moment we could not have any confidence that that deal will be done if the process continues as it has to date."" Discussions began in January in a bid to break the impasse at Stormont and restore the power-sharing executive.Secretary of State Karen Bradley is due to update the House of Commons on progress later this week.Last week, Ms Bradley was questioned by MPs about progress in the Stormont talks. She appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster on Wednesday and provided an update on the ongoing negotiations at Stormont.The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland, David Sterling, told MPs there needs to be clarity about a budget by 8 February."
2018-02-06,Call for new tax to fund the NHS,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-42940433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA new ring-fenced tax to fund the NHS and social care has been proposed by a panel of health experts.The panel, set up by the Liberal Democrats, says the NHS in England should be given an extra £4bn on top of inflation in the next financial year.It has suggested replacing National Insurance with the new tax to close the funding gap.A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said NHS funding ""is at a record high"".""[It] was prioritised in the Budget with an extra £2.8bn, on top of the additional £2bn already provided for social care over the next three years, and an additional £437m of funding for winter,"" the spokesperson said.The future of NHS money has been hotly debated as hospitals struggle to cope with the pressure on resources.Last month, tens of thousands of non-urgent operations were delayed.The 10-member panel included former NHS England chief executive Sir David Nicholson, Peter Carter, former chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing and Clare Gerada, former chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs.It said on top of the £4bn extra needed for next year, an additional £2.5bn would be required for both 2019 and 2020. Prof Gerada said that one of the issues is that working people over the age of 60 benefit from a significantly reduced National Insurance contribution, and people over 65 do not pay it at all. She said National Insurance, which currently funds the NHS and social care, is inadequate as older people are living longer, and not contributing to the ring-fenced tax.She said: ""Old age is now between 85 and 95, so old age has significantly moved. ""Why shouldn't I pay for my fair share of contributions if I'm working?"" As part of the recommendations, the panel also suggested reinstating a cap on the costs paid by individuals on social care.In December, the government scrapped proposals to cap fees at £72,500.It supported creating an office for budget responsibility for health and called for a series of incentives to get people to save more towards their adult social care.The idea of a levy dedicated to funding the NHS was also suggested by former minister Nick Boles."

But how might political history have been different if they hadn't won suffrage? In the real world, the Conservatives couldn't win a majority at the 2017 general election. But what would happen if all the votes cast by women were removed from the equation? Because of different patterns in how men and women vote it is likely the result would have been different and Prime Minister Theresa May would have had a majority.The results of some other elections would probably have been different too in this alternate reality.It's important to be clear about the limitations of what we can know here.The secret ballot means we never have definitive figures about how men and women vote. We are reliant on studies that involve asking a sample of the population how they voted after elections have taken place.The gender gap in voting is fairly small. Other demographic factors have a far bigger impact on people's likelihood to vote for each party.In the past, social class was a dominant factor. Middle-class people were more likely to vote Conservative and working-class people were more likely to vote Labour.Recently that's changed. In 2017, age and education were far more important. Young voters and voters with degrees were more likely to back Labour. Older voters and those with fewer qualifications were more likely to back the Conservatives.But how do the sexes differ when it comes to elections?If we look back over time the gender gap in voting has changed.The British Election Study has data going back to the 1964 general election. In the 1960s and 1970s it found that women were more likely than men to vote Conservative and less likely to vote Labour. It's not easy to find a definitive explanation.Voting behaviour expert Dr Rosalind Shorrocks, from the University of Manchester, says that one of the reasons behind the difference was that women were more religious than men, and also points to the way they were affected by government policies. ""The Conservative Party's post-war anti-rationing stance appealed particularly to housewives who were managing family budgets,"" she explains.So in a close election like 1970, it was probably women voters who sealed the Conservative victory.That trend evaporated in the 1980s - interestingly when the prime minister was a woman - before returning in the 1990s.At recent elections the pattern seems to have become more volatile, like other trends in voting behaviour.In 2010 there was very little difference between men and women in terms of the two main parties. But women were more likely to back the Liberal Democrats and less likely to back smaller parties.The gender gap for other parties became more pronounced in 2015. This was connected to UKIP's very strong showing. They received 13% of the vote overall but were considerably more popular among men than women.That meant that women were more likely than men to vote for both Labour and the Conservatives.So if women had been unable to vote, it's quite likely that UKIP would have won more than the single seat they did. Nigel Farage might have become an MP.In 2017 the pattern changed again. The British Election Study and other post-election surveys suggest that the gender gap was the opposite of what it used to be.Women were more likely than men to vote Labour and less likely to vote Conservative.That is likely to have swayed the overall result. The Conservatives were only eight seats short of an outright majority and there was an unusually large number of seats where they lost very narrowly.So if women had not voted, Theresa May would probably have had more Conservative MPs and British politics could look very different.Again, Dr Shorrocks says this could be down to the perceived impact of government policies.""In 2015 and 2017, it is especially younger women - under the age of 40 - who were particularly supportive of Labour. ""This is likely to be due to the disproportionate impact of austerity on women, with younger women the most likely to say that their cost of living has gone up and quality of services such as the NHS has gone down under the Conservative government.""

2018-02-06,Customs union and Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42943856,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window What's in a word? Number 10 will have cheered some of their Brexit backing troops this morning by ruling out, (again), staying in the customs union. This time they have, for good measure and just to be clear, ruled out not just staying in 'the' customs union, but also remaining in 'a' customs union. This might sound bonkers to you, but the inclusion of 'a' as a mere possibility had given hope to some MPs that the government was open to the idea of essentially replicating the current arrangements and calling it something else. An explicit reminder in those terms therefore will be a frustration to that group which have been pushing for a softer approach. In political terms therefore, it is an important signal at the beginning of an important week. What Sunday's late night statement is not, however, is anything like a new explanation of what the government actually wants to do. It does not mean that there will definitely be a border on the island of Ireland. It does not mean definitely that there will suddenly be vast lorry parks across the whole of Kent or around the ports at Hull or Holyhead. The government's overall aims remain the same - no hard border, and trade that is as frictionless as possible after Brexit. But there are emerging signs of the 'c' - the compromise that Theresa May will try to broker with her party, and her cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks to establish the government's actual position. That is, before of course, Brussels and 27 other countries either say ""oui"", ""non"", or ""peut-etre"". Back in the summer the UK set out two broad possibilities. The fault line that Theresa May needs to walk carefully over this week is between those in her cabinet who want to crack on as fast as possible with agreeing trade deals with other countries, and those who put the preservation of the existing arrangements above that. As we saw last week on her trade trip to China, the prime minister does not want to accept publicly that one of these choices trumps the other. But as her colleagues who toured the broadcast studios yesterday displayed, there are divisions in the Tory party over who wants what, so there does have to be compromise.There are whispers around, as The Times reports, that putting a time limit on to some of the existing arrangements could provide a way through. Interestingly, that's the approach that eventually found favour between Westminster and Brussels over another of the points of contention. The UK accepted that the European courts would continue to have a role in enforcing the rights of EU nationals who live in the UK, but for a time-limited period of 8 years. That gave the PM enough wriggle room to contain the wishes of the rest of the EU and her party. Senior figures in Number 10 suggested then the idea of putting time limits could be a useful precedent for other parts of the deal. This could, perhaps, therefore provide one of the routes out of this tangled part of the Brexit talks. But there are still weeks and months of talking ahead to do. "
2018-02-06,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-42908222,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThis week, MPs voted to move out of their iconic Victorian home, the Palace of Westminster, for five years or more, to allow for vital ""Restoration and Renewal"" work. Next week, the House of Lords will debate the same subject. If peers sign up, it will be the first time Parliament has moved out of its ancient seat since the Luftwaffe bombed the Commons Chamber in 1941.Everyone accepts Parliament's main building is in a terrible state. The roof leaks, the wires crackle, the century-old pipes drip, the structure is riddled with asbestos and the sewage system leaks. A high-powered parliamentary committee warned in 2016 that there was a considerable risk of catastrophic breakdown, which could force the parliamentarians to move out. At the moment we're dealing with a figure between £3.5bn and £5.6bn, depending on how the project is approached. The Parliamentary authorities call these ""indicative costings"", because, like the owners of any ageing property, they are in the position  of not knowing what the real scale of the restoration task is, until the floorboards come up and the brickwork is exposed. Yes, the estimates run up to £5.6bn. It's an enormous sum of money… but this is a vast building, and one of the most recognisable on the planet. And with all the elaborate stonework, endless wood panelling and opulent Victorian gothic décor, restoration will not be cheap. Remember, too, this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which means it cannot be allowed to simply fall down. Restoration has to take place regardless of whether MPs and peers stay or go. But one reason a decision has taken so long to emerge is the political nervousness about spending on this scale at a time of austerity and squeezed public services.Much depends on whether the work is done around the sitting tenants, the MPs, peers and staff, or whether they are moved out, or whether they leave part of the building but remain in another part. MPs have just agreed the so-called ""total decant option"" - moving everyone out for as long as it takes (five to eight years) which is the cheapest option, estimated at £3.52bn.A two-phase scheme, doing one half of the Palace at a time would (if feasible) cost an estimated £4.42bn over nine to 14 years - and the most expensive would be a rolling programme across 25 to 40 years, costing £5.67bn. Despite the Commons vote, these options are not entirely off the table, because some MPs might try to revive them, once more detailed costings are available.And we all know what happens with estimates - the cost or repairs to the Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, have over-run by £25m.    But again this is an example of the way the full extent of the work needed only becomes clear when the builders and engineers can see what's under the surface. And no-one really knows how much it might cost to provide proper 21st century disabled access, for example. It is going to be a long time before the builders move in. First, a much more detailed scoping exercise is needed, to establish exactly what needs to be done. Secondly, there needs to be somewhere for the parliamentarians to move to, if they have to leave the Palace of Westminster - so they won't be moved out before a revamp of some existing office space, and the construction of a temporary chamber. The best guess is that this won't happen until 2025 - and that date could slip.Yes. The fire alarms go off about 60 times a month - and there have been incidents of sewage pipes bursting and of electrical failures. In the bowels of the building, electrical cables are intertwined with steam pipes from the heating system. One of the major risks is that the steam pipes will crack and short out the building's electrical system. It would then become unusable. We might well see MPs and peers being led out of the Palace by torchlight.  The current plan is that they will relocate to offices and a temporary chamber in Richmond House, the old Department of Health building directly to the north of the Parliamentary Estate, on Whitehall.  This will entail an almost complete rebuild of Richmond House - and the result would be an emergency chamber that MPs could move into if some disaster struck in the future. Yes. Clearing out the tangles of redundant wiring, pipes and machinery in the basement levels of the Palace will liberate a great deal of extra space for new uses. This could provide better access for the vast number of visitors to the Palace. Many MPs want a better secondary chamber than the current Westminster Hall, and at the very least a better data network. It could, if MPs and peers wanted to. But the experience of the Scottish Parliament demonstrates that new-build parliaments don't come cheap. A deeper objection is that Parliament is right next to the government - the offices of the main departments are moments away, which means a minister can be summoned to the Chamber at very short notice; accountability would be weakened if ministers took a significant amount of time to get to wherever Parliament moved to. And that's leaving aside the objection to moving away from Westminster, where Parliament has had its permanent home for the best part of 500 years.If Parliament moves out, might it never get back in? This is one of the central fears for many MPs - but there is talk of writing a guarantee of their return into law. A Delivery Authority, modelled on the one which successfully ring-mastered the 2012 Olympics, will now be set up, which will require a bill to go through Parliament. This is the body which will prepare more detailed plans and cost estimates.

2018-02-06,EU's thinking,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42922796,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFancy some slideshows about Free Trade Agreements, non-regression clauses and something called EASA? Thought not. During January officials from the 27 remaining EU countries received a series of presentations from the European Commission about ideas for their future relationship with the UK. The slides reveal valuable clues about the EU's thinking ahead of the next phase of talks. I've read them all so that you don't have to. To help the two sides manage an industry that catches 100 different types of fish worth £625m a year, the EU is mulling over a bespoke fisheries partnership with the UK. It would be based on current and existing fishing patterns. In other words, it might look very similar to the Common Fisheries Policy.  The European Commission helpfully pointed out that the EU catches a lot of fish off the British coast and the UK sells a lot of fish to EU consumers, suggesting a link between access to each other's waters and each other's markets. Officials said that the UK could not remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the best it could hope for was a deal similar to those with the USA and Qatar, which would allow British airlines to fly into the EU but not between cities inside the EU. Britain's unconditional commitment to European security has been heard loud and clear. The EU is thinking about an agreement to share classified intelligence. The UK could be invited to join individual projects in the EU's new defence co-operation programme, called PESCO.  There was a warning that the fall-back for failing to agree a replacement for the European Arrest Warrant would be a 1950s-era convention on extradition that's much less effective. The EU insists that the UK maintains the same data protection standards and guarantees the human rights of EU citizens when it comes to the fight against cross-border crime. ""Governance"" is the name the EU gives to a mechanism for dealing with future problems in the relationship and the punishments available if one side breaks the rules. The main message here is the more the final deal relies on EU law, then the greater the role for the European Court of Justice (ECJ).  Brussels has suggested the ECJ settles disputes with the UK if a Joint Committee of British and European officials can't solve them first. That doesn't fly with the British, so European Commission officials also flagged up the EU's agreement with Ukraine. Ukrainian courts can ask the ECJ for advice, but its rulings could lead to the temporary suspension of sections of the deal with the EU, not changes to the law in Ukraine. This is going to be a huge part of the talks about the future relationship. Also known as the LPF, it is Brussels code for ways to stop the UK undercutting the EU on tax, labour and environmental standards. EU officials admit there are few legal ways they could prevent post-Brexit UK from slashing corporation tax to attract businesses, for example. Does the EU sign a tax co-operation deal like they have with Liechtenstein and Monaco? Do they insist on a written pledge to treat each other nicely? Or do they rely on the threat of the UK one day ending up on the EU's list of tax havens? And officials seemed particularly worried about State Aid - the British government using public money to help sectors of the economy with subsidies or investments. The European Commission says this must be dealt within the Brexit deal because existing international rules aren't enough to cope with a very big, very rich, very close neighbour like the UK. The slides show the EU looking confident in some areas, less so in others. Officials are wading through precedents, but are finding the UK is too big and too close to use off-the-shelf solutions for everything. And now a warning. These are the EU's thoughts about some of the things that will have to be addressed in the negotiations over its future relationship with the UK. It is not the policy for the next phase of Brexit talks. At least, not yet.For that we will have to wait for EU leaders to agree their strategy at a summit in March. "

2018-02-06,My political hero,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42911943,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGiven that he wrote a book on the subject in 2004 William Hague's choice of Pitt the Younger as his political hero is hardly surprising. However, the fact it was a former prime minister who first introduced him to the name is a nice tale.""I first heard of him from Margaret Thatcher can you believe, when I had my own fit of youthful endeavour in politics as a 16 year old, giving a speech at the Tory Party Conference in 1977,"" said the former Conservative leader. ""I was hauled off to meet Margaret Thatcher and she said to the assembled press: 'We could be standing here with another William Pitt' and I had no idea who that was, and I thought I'd better find out and as I did - over the next 20 years - I became quite an admirer.William Pitt the Younger, so styled because his father 'Pitt the Elder' had also been prime minister, was a political prodigy. He graduated from Cambridge at 17 and entered Parliament four years later in 1781. When he became prime minister he was still just 24 years old. Lord Hague said: ""He was written off at the time as a 'mince pie' prime minister, just in place for Christmas and then out, but he served for 19 years ... still our youngest and second-longest-serving prime minister"".Young Pitt was a reformer and counted the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce amongst his closest friends. While others referred to him as a Tory, he always maintained he was an independent. William Hague is profuse in his praise.""He seemed to me to be an undervalued figure in history, that his name would come up in an episode of Black Adder, as a figure of fun ... Actually he was a towering figure, who stood alone against Napoleon, who plotted naval strategy with Nelson, he dealt with the most extraordinary range of circumstances"" .Pitt had become prime minister when Britain was still reeling from the loss of its American colonies.  With the national debt spiralling upward ""Honest Billy"", as he was sometimes called in the press, set about steadying the ship. Later in his career he would introduce both income tax and the first paper money, not backed by actual gold. They were steps that didn't always make him popular, but as Lord Hague argues, they did produce results,""This was much mocked at the time ... but his keeping the country creditworthy, the inexhaustible credit of the City of London and Britain ... allowed it to overcome Napoleon in the end, because France they said could almost never run out of men, but Britain would never run out of money"". Pitt's rivalry with the French emperor would come to define his premiership.Despite his success, Pitt was famously aloof and even shy. He never married and his devotion to his country consumed his life. His drinking contributed to his death at just 46 years old. Former foreign secretary Lord Hague, who himself became party leader at the relatively young age of 36, feel some sympathy for him. ""Becoming so powerful so early in life, actually stunted his development as a human being in other ways because you don't make new friends or interests if you are at the heart of government ... I think all of us who are in those situations experience a bit of what William Pitt did ... but most of us leave at some point, he never did"".Lord Hague reserves his greatest admiration for Pitt the orator and parliamentarian,""He really gave full vent to his personality in Parliament and this is an age where the House of Commons had in it: Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, William Wilberforce, this is an age that makes today's Parliament look pedestrian in the extreme and he was the equal, if not the master, of them all.""William Pitt left office in 1801, but was prime minister again by 1804 and, despite warnings from his doctors that his work might kill him, he refused to leave his post and died as prime minister in 1806.In the end he was, Lord Hague said: ""The pilot who weathered the storm.""This interview is one of a series on politicians' political heroes, to be broadcast on the BBC's Daily Politics on Fridays."
2018-02-06,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.

2018-02-06,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180206140910/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

What happened?Jeremy Corbyn pulled off one of his trademark moves - bringing up a subject that few expected. With Brexit, trouble on the railways and Theresa May's future dominating the chat at Westminster he decided to put her on the spot over rising crime. She is the former home secretary after all. The exchanges threatened to turn into the sort of dry trading of statistics we have seen from the two leaders on the NHS.Jeremy Corbyn said crime was going up and the police were starved of resources. Mrs May claimed it was going down and police budgets had gone up. They were using different sets of stats. Mr Corbyn was referring to recorded crime and the PM was using the Crime Survey for England and Wales, a face-to-face study of victims' experiences. Reality Check: What has happened to police numbers? The Labour leader then quoted HM Inspector of Constabulary to back up his point that the thin blue line was at breaking point.The Labour leader tried a different tack - what about the chief constables saying they were at crisis point? And the rise in violent crime, particularly gun crime? Mrs May said thanks to changes she made as home secretary more vulnerable people had the confidence to report domestic violence and modern slavery so recorded crime was going up.Mr Corbyn accused the PM of cutting ""both the prevention and the cure"" by privatising the probation service and cutting youth worker jobs. Mr Corbyn then turned to unlikely inspiration in the form of Tory backbencher Philip Davis, who had said the ""first duty of government is to keep people safe"" something Mr Corbyn suggested they were not doing. Mrs May went on the attack against what she said was the Labour leader's record of supporting more lenient sentences.Mrs May always gets the last words in these exchanges and, as usual, she used them to take a swipe at Labour's economic policies. She claimed that a Labour government would wreck the economy and mean less money for the police.Full marks to the SNP's leader at Westminster Iain Blackford for persistence - this was the fourth time he had raised bank branch closures at PMQs, getting very short shrift from Mrs May every time. He had some good news this time - 10 Royal Bank of Scotland branches have been saved from closure. He again called on the PM to take the issue seriously.Dennis Skinner - known as the Beast of Bolsover for his take-no-prisoners-style - turns 86 on Sunday.But he was far from pleased to be reminded of this by Speaker John Bercow, claiming that he didn't know it was his birthday, before growling: ""I don't believe in celebrating age."" He then delivered the kind of angry, impassioned question on the NHS that has made him such a favourite with Labour colleagues over the years (Mrs May also wished him a happy birthday).Conservative right-winger Philip Davis seemed pleased to get a name check from Mr Corbyn, saying there was ""clearly hope for him yet"".Lib Dem MP Layla Moran asked about homelessness.Veteran Tory Euroscpetic Sir Bill Cash attempted to stiffen the PM's resolve in the next round of Brexit negotiations.And finally, Sir Vince Cable got a question. The Lib Dem leader asked if the government would stop American firms being given the right to grab a slice of the NHS in trade negotiations with the Trump administration. Mrs May gave her former cabinet colleague a courteous but non-committal reply without mentioning the NHS once.Here is Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil's take on the session:Here is what BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy made of it:No stumbles. No embarrassments. No damage. The PM sailed through question time unscathed. Jeremy Corbyn complained about police cuts. Ian Blackford hailed his own leadership in stopping RBS branch cuts. And Sir Vince Cable, rather pointedly not called by Mr Speaker until almost the end of the session, demanded an assurance that the NHS would not be opened up to US contractors in some future trade deal. He set perhaps the most subtle trap, and while the PM didn't fall into it, nor did she offer any reassurance…. We will hear more of this.Brexit Committee Chair Hilary Benn followed up with a question on post Brexit border controls - a thorny issue which extracted the first note of irritation from the PM, but again there was a minimalist, defensive answer.This prime minister doesn't bite back very much, bar the most boiler-plate party political answers. It's safety first and last - and very hard for her questioners to penetrate. But remember the kind of (twice) weekly excruciation John Major faced from Tony Blair… every PMQs saw a deadly soundbite which salted Tory political wounds.Jeremy Corbyn's talents lie elsewhere; Mrs May is fortunate that effective Commons theatre is not his speciality.

2018-02-07,Negative Brexit forecasts revealed,https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42977967,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEvery nation and region of the UK would be worse off after Brexit, according to estimates by government officials.The forecasts, seen by MPs on Thursday, model the impact of the UK staying in the single market, doing a trade deal with the EU or leaving without a deal. In each scenario, annual UK GDP would be lower, by 2%, 5% and 8% respectively.The government says it does not cover all outcomes - and one Tory MP said the figures were ""complete nonsense"".Following a leak of some of the information to Buzzfeed last week and political pressure to release it, ministers agreed to allow MPs to see the reports on a confidential basis in the House of Commons library.The forecasts suggests the North-East of England would be worse hit by Brexit, with output falling by 3% if the UK stayed in the single market, 11% under a trade deal and 16% with not trade deal and World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The research suggests London would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 2.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% and 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% and 9.5%.Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob-Rees Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad.The government has said the analysis is preliminary and crucially does not measure the impact of the UK's preferred option of a bespoke and comprehensive trade agreement, covering goods and financial services.The research suggests that the option of staying in the single market and customs union, which has been rejected by ministers, would be the least damaging but would still see GDP across different parts of the country fall by between 1% and 3%.In the event of a limited free trade deal being negotiated, output would fall by 8% in the West Midlands, the North West of England and Northern Ireland, by 6% in Scotland and 5.5% in Wales.Should the UK leave the EU in March 2019 without any kind of deal, it suggest four parts of the UK would see a double digit fall in GDP. As well as the North East of England, the North West of England and Northern Ireland would see a 12% fall, while the West Midlands would see a 13% fall.Other official estimates suggest the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The figures emerged as representatives of Nissan and other Japanese companies are set to meet Theresa May and Philip Hammond on Thursday. Former attorney general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve said the figures showed the risks of leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would hurt the ""poorest and vulnerable"" in society.Even if the UK achieved its stated objective of a deep and special partnership with the EU and trade deals with countries like the US, he said it was likely to yield, at best, a very small economic boost.But Eurosceptic Conservative MP John Redwood said the risks of a no-deal scenario had been overestimated and the Treasury figures were ""complete nonsense""."

The SNP called for him to be suspended from the party.The 54-year-old is reported to have made a joke about Robert Burns not being ""bent"", and used a racist term when referring to a Chinese meal.In a statement, Mr Gaffney said: ""Last week I attended a Labour Students Burns Supper In Edinburgh.""At that event I used certain language relating to the Chinese and LGBT communities that was wrong and completely inappropriate.""I want to offer my unreserved apologies for what I said; my remarks were deeply offensive and unacceptable.""I will be taking part in equality and diversity training at the earliest opportunity.""I will do everything possible to make amends with both the Chinese community and the LGBT community.""A Labour party spokesman said: ""Hugh Gaffney MP has been reprimanded for using inappropriate and offensive language. ""He has apologised unreservedly and referred himself for equality and diversity training. The Labour Party is clear that this language is unacceptable.""Mr Gaffney's comments come a month after he complained about being subject to slurs over his weight and Scottish accent during Commons debates.The Labour MP said he had been heckled ""something awful"" by Tory MPs. During the recent Scottish Labour leadership campaign, contender Anas Sarwar said he was subjected to racial abuse.He drew up an eight-point plan on how the party could tackle everyday racism and Islamophobia.In response to Mr Gaffney's comments, Mr Sarwar tweeted: ""Today is sadly another example of why we need to recognise that everyday racism is a reality.""The SNP's Humza Yousaf took to social media to call for Labour to withdraw the party whip from Mr Gaffney.Mr Yousaf said: ""This is utterly awful. A simple apology and diversity training does not cut it.""In fact, it is a slap in the face to suggest this absolves him.""He added: ""At very least he should be suspended from the party and whip withdrawn."""

The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"".It comes as further details emerged of the Treasury's estimates of the impact on the economy of Brexit.According to the leaked estimates, the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.MPs have also been allowed to see the impact assessments for their own regions. All regions will see their economies shrink, with the North East of England, the West Midlands, and Northern Ireland being the worst affected, according to the analysis. The North-East would be hit hardest - with staying in the single market and customs union shaving 3% off GDP, an 11% reduction under a free trade deal and 16% under a no-deal WTO scenario,London would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 3.5% in each of the three scenarios.Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% or 9%.

We've shown we can do that, we did it in December and we're going to do it again.""The tensions within the Conservative Party were underlined on Monday when pro-EU former minister Anna Soubry told the BBC Mrs May should ""sling out"" arch Brexiteers, and threatened to quit the party.Eurosceptics have been calling for a ""clean"" separation with the EU so the UK has the freedom to strike new trade deals, while pro-EU MPs say the UK should retain the closest possible access to the single market.Former Chancellor Ken Clarke said Theresa May had to see ""where the majority of opinion"" was within the cabinet, offer some concessions and those who could not live with the agreed stance would have to resign.He told BBC Radio 4's Today he wanted the UK to keep ""most of the features of the customs union and the single market"" after the transition period and suggested Parliament would back such a move. But fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said Mrs May had ""pushed back"" against that position, which he said was at odds with the government's stated position of achieving ""regulatory autonomy"".He told Today that ""no-one"" wanted a hard border on the island of Ireland or tariffs on trade between the UK and EU and it would be ""perverse"" if the EU ended up on insisting on them. The 11-member European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee is a key part of the government's decision-making process.Its members include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who were at the forefront of the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain.They are expected to discuss trade at another meeting on Thursday.The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said this week there is ""not a moment to lose"" in finding a deal before the end of the year. Among those calling for more clarity on the UK's position is the British Chambers of Commerce, which has written to Mrs May asking for a ""clear, unequivocal statement of intent"".""The perception amongst businesses on the ground, large and small alike, is one of continued division,"" it said.""Even amongst the many optimistic, future-oriented firms - those who see opportunity in change - patience is wearing thin. Directly affected companies are poised to activate contingency plans. Many others, worryingly, have simply disengaged.""In response, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK's aims were very clear, namely tariff-free trade with the EU with a ""minimum of frictions"" in the years ahead.Meanwhile, former transport minister Stephen Hammond has urged the UK to consider rejoining the European Free Trade Association, which it left in 1972 prior to joining the then European Economic Community.Speaking in a debate in Parliament, he said membership of the free trade body - whose members are Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland - was a ""sensible option"" which would give the UK the economic certainty and flexibility it wanted - although such an outcome has been rejected by ministers.

It can actually be very good for the speaker rather than damaging.""He said that protestors at the event in Bristol were trying to stop him speak, but there was no threat of violence until there were claims that one of the demonstrators had been hit.Apart from the masks, he said the protest was ""perfectly legitimate"" and only a little ""pushy"".""As a politician you should expect that people may come and heckle and that not everybody is going to want to sit there quietly and listen to my view of the world,"" said Mr Rees-Mogg.""As MPs, we can hardly complain considering the noise we make in the chamber of the House of Commons.""The committee is investigating claims that free speech is being inhibited in universities - and Mr Rees-Mogg told them the protest he faced was much less worrying than the ""online abuse"" faced by some female MPs.The Conservative MP said he feared ""self-censorship"" from universities, who might not want the ""hassle"" and expense of inviting speakers who might be controversial.Mr Gyimah, the universities minister, had told the Human Rights Committee that a culture of intolerance was spilling over from social media.""There is a section within our universities that think you can restrict free speech.""If what you're doing is essentially mollycoddling someone from opinions and views that they might find offensive, then that is wrong.""But Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee, questioned whether there was evidence of free speech being eroded.Concerns about threats to free speech in university had been widely publicised, but that was not the same as providing evidence, she said.Mr Gyimah said he thought there was a growing problem in universities of groups trying to stop others from expressing ideas - although specific evidence could be ""difficult to gather"".He said there had been protests over speakers on topics such as Israel and issues of religion, sexuality or political belief.There have also been concerns over ""no-platforming"", where people are prevented from speaking - but members of the committee pressed Mr Gyimah over whether there was any proof of this being a widespread problem in universities.The committee is also considering whether the Prevent counter-extremism strategy stops students from discussing some controversial subjects.Ben Wallace, Security Minister, said there was ""no real evidence of free speech being curtailed by Prevent"".""We have struggled to find evidence of actual events that have been cancelled.""But Mr Wallace said: ""Freedom of speech is not absolute."" For example, it was not lawful to incite racial hatred.He said that Prevent was a response to an authentic problem, of people being radicalised on campus.Radical Islamists were still recruiting in ""educational settings"" and 23,000 people in the UK were currently considered security concerns with an ""extremist mindset"", he told the committee.But MPs and peers on the committee questioned whether there was enough guidance to make a clear distinction between legitimate, strong views and unlawful violent extremism.They raised concerns that even if events had not been cancelled, there could have been events that were never even proposed, because of fears over being referred to Prevent.In December, the previous Universities Minister, Jo Johnson, warned that universities that failed to uphold free speech could face fines from the new regulator, the Office for Students.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said: ""In our universities, which should be bastions of free thought and expression, we've seen the efforts of politicians and academics to engage in open debate frustrated by an aggressive and intolerant minority.  ""It's time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this."""
2018-02-07,EU 'seeks single market sanction power',https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42964004,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union wants to be able to restrict the UK's access to the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit, a leaked document suggests.The power to suspend ""certain benefits"" would apply during the post-Brexit transition phase before the final arrangements come into force.It is revealed in a draft section of the UK and EU's withdrawal agreement, which has yet to be finalised.The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"".But it provoked an angry reaction from former UKIP leader Nigel Farage who said the transition deal on offer would be tantamount to creating a ""Vichy Britain"".Theresa May is to chair the first of two key Brexit meetings with her senior ministers later as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position.The first Brexit cabinet committee will focus on Northern Ireland and immigration, while trade will be discussed on Thursday.The transition period is expected to begin straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union on 29 March 2019, and end on 31 December 2020.The UK says this will allow businesses to adapt to its new relationship with the EU. The EU says its rules should still apply during the transition period, as will rulings of the European Court of Justice.According to a footnote in the EU papers leaked to journalists in Brussels, if referring a dispute to the EU court would take too long, the withdrawal agreement ""should provide for a mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market"".It does not go into detail about what disputes could trigger the powers being used, or which parts of the single market could be suspended.It also says the UK would be consulted about fishing quotas, and would have to pledge not to act against the EU in international organisations.A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""This is a draft document produced by the EU that simply reflects their stated directives.""Together with the UK's position as set out last month, it provides a ""solid foundation for the negotiations on the implementation period"".The UK plans to continue participating in the single market - which allows frictionless trade and the free movement of people between EU members - during the transition phase, before the final trading relationship - which has yet to be negotiated - comes into force.Some Conservative MPs are unhappy at the idea of the UK following EU rules but having no say on them, and have warned that when Brexit happens in March 2019 it will be ""in name only"".Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Commons Public Administration Committee, said it would be ""utterly perverse"" if the EU ended up imposing tariffs on British goods given the current levels of alignment between it and the UK. ""This is an indication of how fearful the EU is that they have to make these silly threats,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Of course we are going to do rather well outside the EU and we are going to show the EU up as a rather less successful organisation than it is.""And former trade minister Lord Jones, a leading pro-Leave voice within the business community, said it was increasingly clear no deal was better than a bad one.We've had position papers. We've had guidelines, directives and a joint report. This is the first draft of legally-binding words that will end up in the withdrawal agreement - the Brexit treaty that will seal the UK's departure from the EU and a document of real historical significance.EU sources say it proves that they are getting a move on - ""Please! No more position papers"" - which the UK wants too.The EU's suggestion, in a footnote, that the UK's access to parts of the single market will be curtailed if the European Court of Justice cannot solve any disputes within the two-ish year timeframe of the transition, will sound threatening to some. To others it will sound like an obvious back-up plan to deal with the famously long time it takes for the ECJ to make a decision.The Brits caution that this is a first draft for the EU27 and does not reflect any negotiations over what they prefer to call the implementation phase."

The Commons Environment Committee said it wanted to find out who was behind a spate of cases of real fur items being passed off as faux (fake) fur in shops.It will also examine current laws relating to the fur trade and what changes, if any, Brexit may bring.An investigation earlier this year by the charity Humane Society International found that a number of leading High Street stores were unwittingly selling fake fur clothing that actually had its origins not in synthetic fibres, but in a variety of real creatures.""Retailers have a duty of care to their customers who have the right to know what they are buying,"" Neil Parish, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, said as he announced the inquiry. ""Our inquiry will determine where responsibility lies for the increase in illegal fur sales and identify the steps that need to be taken to stop it in its tracks.""Among other issues, the cross-party committee will look at whether labelling of fur and faux fur products can be improved and how this would be enforced.

There are questions still to be answered. But tonight is not the night for those questions to be answered.""Despite the tragic circumstances, this is now an opportunity to start a movement to change politics. Let's go back to traditional Labour values and look after those who can't look after themselves.He said he wanted ""a kind message in life in general, not just in politics.""Let's be kind to each other...that's the message I learned from my dad.""Carl Sargeant was Alyn and Deeside AM from 2003 until his death.Sacked as cabinet secretary for communities and children amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, he was found dead four days later having apparently taken his own life.First Minister Carwyn Jones faces two ongoing investigations - one into his handling of the sacking of Carl Sargeant while the other is considering whether he misled the assembly in statements about what he knew about allegations of bullying within the Welsh Government in 2014. After the by-election result was declared, Welsh Government Economy Secretary and Labour Clwyd South AM Ken Skates was asked if Jack Sargeant would now be a thorn in the side of the first minister.""I don't think so, no,"" he said. ""He'll be a thorn in the side of the Tories, that's for sure, and he'll be a thorn in the side of anybody who stands in the way of the best interests of the people of Alyn and Deeside.""That's what Jack's focused on, that's what he's going to deliver."" Speaking before the result, Clwyd West Conservative AM Darren Millar said it would be ""an endorsement of Jack and Carl Sargeant's family"". ""I don't think in any way the Labour party or Carwyn Jones can claim credit for what I think will be a clear win for Jack Sargeant,"" he said. No surprises that Jack Sargeant won this by-election. In the end, he increased Labour's majority.So he's off to Cardiff Bay, following in his late father's footsteps.When he gets there, what sort of relationship will he have with First Minister Carwyn Jones, who dismissed his father?People around Jack Sargeant answer that by saying he's a team player.There are outstanding questions however, as Jack Sargeant acknowledged in his acceptance speech, about the way Carl Sargeant was sacked. An independent inquiry will look into all of that - and the Sargeant family has a role in helping to draw up the inquiry's terms of reference."

Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over the past decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their UK operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars. The big majority of these are exported.The motor industry has expressed concern that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10% and be subject to customs delays after Britain leaves the European Union.""Nissan Europe Chairman Paul Willcox will join representatives from other Japanese companies in meeting the prime minister and chancellor on Thursday to discuss our operations and investments in the UK,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We will not be disclosing details of the discussions.""Japanese drug companies have also made Britain their European base. Some are concerned about future drug regulations, with any divergence with the EU likely to pose regulatory challenges. London is also home to Japanese banks, such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. Like other foreign banks, they are keen to know about trading and so-called ""passporting"" arrangements for access to the EU.In 2016 Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May amid fears over the future of its production plant in Sunderland.Nissan sought assurances over post-Brexit arrangements ahead of future investment in the Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest car factory."
2018-02-07,Migration cut 'could cost Scotland £10bn',https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-42972979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government's aim of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands could cost Scotland's economy up to £10bn from 2040, according to the Scottish government.The target was set by David Cameron in 2010, but has never been met.Annual net migration to the UK is currently 230,000.Scotland's external affairs secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said a dramatic reduction in that number would be ""catastrophic"" for Scotland. But the UK government insisted it would put in place an immigration system that works in the best interests of the whole of the UK - including Scotland - after the country leaves the EU. And it has said the public is in favour of lower immigration, and has insisted that all future decisions about immigration would be evidence-based.Ms Hyslop is to unveil a Scottish government paper on Wednesday afternoon that sets out a range of scenarios for future migration, including the UK government's objective of cutting it to the tens of thousands. The paper suggested that even if the UK government only reduces migration as a result of the end of freedom of movement for EU workers, Scotland's economic growth would be £5bn a year lower from 2040 - 4.5% lower than it would have been otherwise.It said this would compare to a UK-wide fall of only 3.7%, which it said demonstrated Scotland's greater reliance on migration.Ms Hyslop said: ""While some of these dates and figures may seem a long way off, the decisions the UK government takes in the next few months on the future of migration policy will have a long-term effect that it will be hard to reverse.""""Some sectors of our economy are already finding it harder to secure the workers they need as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU.""That makes it all the more important to have the powers to set a tailored migration policy based on the unique needs and circumstances of Scotland, to ensure we protect and enhance future economic growth.""The paper is the first in a series aimed at providing evidence and building a consensus for more powers for the Scottish Parliament, to tackle specific and long-standing challenges, and to address the impact of Brexit.It will set out the importance of migration to Scotland's economy, Scotland's needs within a UK migration system, and options for Scotland to secure more powers over migration to better support its economy and society.A Home Office spokesman said: ""After we leave the EU, we will put in place an immigration system which works in the best interests of the whole of the UK.""Decisions about our future immigration system will be based on evidence, which is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee to assess the economic and social impact of EU citizens in all parts of the UK.""We are engaging with and considering the view of all stakeholders - including the Scottish government and businesses in Scotland.""It also said there would be an implementation period after Brexit to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for businesses, and that EU citizens already working in the UK will be able to apply for settled status so they can stay.Last month, MPs on the Home Affairs Committee called on the UK government to cut its ""tens of thousands"" migration target. It said the failure to meet the target ""undermines"" public trust, and argued that immigration policies should instead consider the UK's needs ""and humanitarian obligations""."
2018-02-07,UK 'could adopt' Norway recycling system,https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-42953038,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Scandinavian deposit-based system for recycling bottles is thought likely to be adopted in the UK.Advisers to government say the schemes have massively reduced plastic litter in the environment and seas. And a ministerial delegation has been to Norway to see if the UK should copy an industry-led scheme that recycles 97% of bottles.In the UK, figures show that only around half of all plastic bottles get recycled.Norway claims to offer the most cost-efficient way of tackling plastic litter.The Norwegian government decided the best method would be to put a tax on every bottle that's not recycled - then leave the operating details of the scheme up to business.It works like this: The consumer pays a deposit on every bottle - the equivalent of 10p to 25p depending on size. They return it empty and post it into a machine which reads the barcode and produces a coupon for the deposit.If the careless consumer has left liquid in the bottle, the machine eats it anyway - but hands the deposit to the shopkeeper who'll need to empty the bottle.Similar schemes are in operation in other Nordic nations, Germany, and some states in the US and Canada.The managers of the Norway operation say it could easily be applied to the UK.In Norway, the deposit-return machine accepts only two types of plastic bottle, with approved labels and even approved glue to fix the labels. This allows the labels to be stripped easily, and simplifies recycling.In the UK, roadside collection of plastic bottles in Britain are bedevilled by contamination from rogue rubbish being put in the recycling container.Kjell Olav Maldum, chief executive of Infinitum which runs the Norway bottle scheme, told BBC News: ""There are other recycling schemes, but we believe ours is the most cost-efficient. ""We think it could be copied in the UK - or anywhere.""Our principle is that if drinks firms can get bottles to shops to sell their products, they can also collect those same bottles."" Scotland has already committed to a deposit return scheme, without details so far.But politicians in Westminster have been more cautious amid lobbying by drinks manufacturers and fears from small shops about the administrative burden.  In Norway, small shopkeepers are said to generally favour the deposit return system. They get paid a small fee for each bottle, and are also said to benefit from increased footfall from people returning bottles.Sajana Pariyar, who works at the Joker minimarket in central Oslo told me: ""It's a good thing. People return the bottle and with the money they get from it they buy things from us.""It increases the number of people in our shops. It's good for business.""When we visited her store, a homeless man patiently fed a sack-full of bottles and cans into the mouth of the machine. He'd collected the containers from a nearby office, and raised £5 in the process.But even in recycling-conscious Norway, some people still transgress. The worst offenders are youngsters quaffing energy drinks on the run to school.So some schools have now installed bottle collecting racks at the school gates to avoid plastic bottles going into general rubbish bins. The most virtuous consumers are older beer drinkers who can stash their cans at home before returning them later.Just 3% of Norway's plastic bottles elude the deposit return scheme, but even so the absolute numbers are high.Terje Skovly works at a municipal recycling scheme, ROAF, which collects the bins from 70,000 homes on the outskirts of Oslo.At his plant - a 3-D maze of conveyors and ramps - a steady stream of plastic bottles is isolated from other waste by infrared recognition.These bottles have been mixed with other waste during collection so they can't be used again for food grade packaging. They get down-graded into plastic furniture instead.""I get angry when I see that,"" he told me as he glared at the bottle conveyor below us. ""Why are people so lazy that they can't be bothered to recycle a bottle? We should increase the deposit to 50p on a large bottle.""What was the value in lost deposits? I asked. He made a rough calculation… just under a million dollars. A year.With that amount of cash swilling around the scheme in spare change, it's little wonder that representatives of other nations are considering the advantages of going Norwegian.  But even Norway's ultra-efficient recycling system can't compete with virgin plastic on cost. The problem, the recyclers say, is that the ingredients of plastic - oil and gas - are simply too cheap.The cost of each bottle is subsidised by a few pence by the manufacturer. This ultimately gets passed to the consumer.The operators of the scheme argue that it's more appropriate for people buying drinks to pay for them to be recycled, rather than have taxpayers foot the bill for cleaning up litter on beaches. The UK government's working party studying plastic waste will mention Norway as an example of a system working well.Members are also intrigued by the example of Lithuania, which is said to have achieved a 93% return rate in just three years.Samantha Harding, from the countryside group CPRE, has been campaigning against plastic litter for more than a decade.She told BBC News: ""It frustrates me when people say 'oh, they only recycle because they're Scandinavian… in the UK we're different.'""Well, they're doing it in Germany too - and states in the US and Canada. Are they all the same, so are we different from all of them?""The key is to get an economic incentive - put a deposit on the bottle and most people won't throw money away.""She applauded the Norwegian system of putting racks round bins in public places for discarded plastic bottles.""People say they don't want to see homeless people rummaging through bins to get the deposit back on bottles… why don't we make it easy for them?""Ms Harding said one great advantage of deposit return schemes is that it obliges each part of the plastic chain to change their behaviour - from product concept to design; to manufacture; transport; use; and finally disposal.""This is great because we've seen big firms campaigning against good schemes because it forced them to take more responsibility. We're in a crisis now - there's no room for that sort of thing,"" she said.Follow Roger on Twitter."

Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."

So for those still stuck on the launch pad, here is a very quick guide to what's going on.We are still on course to leave the European Union on 29 March next year. No-one can agree on what happens after that though.If the government gets its way, the answer will be very little, in the short-term at least. Brexit Secretary David Davis - in full Neil Armstrong mode - wants to bring the country in for a soft landing.Businesses need time to adjust, he says, so he wants a two-year transition period, which will feel very much like staying in the EU. He wants the UK and EU to agree a deal on that by March. Then the really difficult bit begins - negotiating a new relationship with Germany, France and the rest of the EU.Prime Minister Theresa May wants to end free movement of people into the UK. She also doesn't want the UK to be told what to do by European judges. But she also wants businesses to be able to trade pretty much as they do now across the EU.This sounds to some in Brussels like ""cherry picking"" - not their favourite activity. They say that the ability to trade across the EU without tariffs is one of the benefits of being a member of the club. If the UK leaves, they say, it can't expect to have the same terms. But Mrs May has yet to spell out what she wants in any detail.Whatever she says is guaranteed to disappoint a section of her party, threatening her already precarious premiership.But if she doesn't act soon, the EU will start filling in the blanks itself.It wants a rough outline of a trade deal by this October - to put it to a vote in the European Parliament and get it ratified by the remaining 27 EU members in time for Brexit day. There will also be a vote in the Commons.And we haven't even mentioned those campaigning for another referendum..."

There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."

But how might political history have been different if they hadn't won suffrage? In the real world, the Conservatives couldn't win a majority at the 2017 general election. But what would happen if all the votes cast by women were removed from the equation? Because of different patterns in how men and women vote it is likely the result would have been different and Prime Minister Theresa May would have had a majority.The results of some other elections would probably have been different too in this alternate reality.It's important to be clear about the limitations of what we can know here.The secret ballot means we never have definitive figures about how men and women vote. We are reliant on studies that involve asking a sample of the population how they voted after elections have taken place.The gender gap in voting is fairly small. Other demographic factors have a far bigger impact on people's likelihood to vote for each party.In the past, social class was a dominant factor. Middle-class people were more likely to vote Conservative and working-class people were more likely to vote Labour.Recently that's changed. In 2017, age and education were far more important. Young voters and voters with degrees were more likely to back Labour. Older voters and those with fewer qualifications were more likely to back the Conservatives.But how do the sexes differ when it comes to elections?If we look back over time the gender gap in voting has changed.The British Election Study has data going back to the 1964 general election. In the 1960s and 1970s it found that women were more likely than men to vote Conservative and less likely to vote Labour. It's not easy to find a definitive explanation.Voting behaviour expert Dr Rosalind Shorrocks, from the University of Manchester, says that one of the reasons behind the difference was that women were more religious than men, and also points to the way they were affected by government policies. ""The Conservative Party's post-war anti-rationing stance appealed particularly to housewives who were managing family budgets,"" she explains.So in a close election like 1970, it was probably women voters who sealed the Conservative victory.That trend evaporated in the 1980s - interestingly when the prime minister was a woman - before returning in the 1990s.At recent elections the pattern seems to have become more volatile, like other trends in voting behaviour.In 2010 there was very little difference between men and women in terms of the two main parties. But women were more likely to back the Liberal Democrats and less likely to back smaller parties.The gender gap for other parties became more pronounced in 2015. This was connected to UKIP's very strong showing. They received 13% of the vote overall but were considerably more popular among men than women.That meant that women were more likely than men to vote for both Labour and the Conservatives.So if women had been unable to vote, it's quite likely that UKIP would have won more than the single seat they did. Nigel Farage might have become an MP.In 2017 the pattern changed again. The British Election Study and other post-election surveys suggest that the gender gap was the opposite of what it used to be.Women were more likely than men to vote Labour and less likely to vote Conservative.That is likely to have swayed the overall result. The Conservatives were only eight seats short of an outright majority and there was an unusually large number of seats where they lost very narrowly.So if women had not voted, Theresa May would probably have had more Conservative MPs and British politics could look very different.Again, Dr Shorrocks says this could be down to the perceived impact of government policies.""In 2015 and 2017, it is especially younger women - under the age of 40 - who were particularly supportive of Labour. ""This is likely to be due to the disproportionate impact of austerity on women, with younger women the most likely to say that their cost of living has gone up and quality of services such as the NHS has gone down under the Conservative government.""

2018-02-07,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in.

2018-02-07,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180207185405/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-08,Council tax hikes planned 'across England',https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-42984368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNearly all local authorities in England are set to raise council tax and service charges amid concerns for their financial stability, a survey suggests.Council tax is set to rise in 95% of authorities while 93% will hike service fees, according to the 2018 State of Local Government Finance research.The planned increases come as 80% of councils fear for their balance sheets. Last week, Northamptonshire County Council banned all new spending and said its financial future was ""grave"".Council tax can rise by 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, although the largest authorities are to be allowed to increase it by up to 5.99%.Local authorities also oversee charges for services such as parking, burials and planning and 93% of respondents to the survey indicated new or increased fees in order to make ends meet. Central government funding has come under fire as a result, with councils said to be calling for a ""fundamental redesign of the financial system"".The research - carried out by the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) think tank and The Municipal Journal - claims the biggest pressure on authorities' budgets is children's services (nearly 32% of councils), then adult social care (close to 28%) and housing and homelessness (19%).In the 113 councils that responded to the survey, a third of all those in England, social care was found to be the greatest long-term pressure. Additionally, councils are uncertain about what monies they will receive after 2020 as decisions over business rates and the Fair Funding Review are yet to be decided, the report found.Of those 113 respondents, just six said they would not raise council tax. Of those six, only East Hampshire District Council agreed to be identified.On Friday, it emerged Northamptonshire County Council had imposed emergency controls on its spending in order to address ""severe financial challenges"". The move, known as a section 114 notice, is issued when a council does not have enough money to meet its expenditure. It is the first local authority in 20 years to resort to the measure. The Conservative-run council has projected overspend of £21.1m for 2017-18 and its chief financial officer warned predictions for the following year were ""grave"".On Tuesday, Surrey County Council (SCC) agreed a 6% rise in its council tax in the face of a £105m funding gap, according to analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, as reported in The Times.In February 2017, the Tory-led authority threatened to impose a 15% increase in council tax in order to deal with its deficit - which would have triggered a referendum - but then found itself at the centre of  a political row over a so-called ""sweetheart deal"" from the government. Analysis by Daniel Wainwright, BBC England data journalist How much you pay in council tax depends on where you live and how expensive your house would have been when the system was first drawn up, in 1991. Police and crime commissioners and fire authorities all add to the bill and in areas with county, district and parish councils, each tier of local government will have its own precept.Band A homes, those that would have been of the lowest value, will pay the least and Band H will pay the most.When all these bills and different bands of housing are taken into account, eight of the 10 areas with the highest average council tax bills are in Surrey. People in the Elmbridge district will pay almost £2,000 per home.Despite this, the county council is still facing a £105 million funding gap.While London is known for being expensive, particularly when it comes to housing, it has some of the lowest council tax bills in the country.People in Wandsworth pay an average of £645 a year per household. In Westminster, where the average property price is more than £1 million, people pay an average of £724 a year.A spokesman for SCC, which serves the UK's richest county in terms of high net-worth individuals, said: ""We've been successfully managing the growing need for adult social care, children's and other key services partly through making savings of £540m since 2010 and have made sure we keep within our overall budget.""Councils in England get their money from:The money is then spent on:Source: BBC Reality CheckJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, claimed the survey showed that councils ""are on the edge"" and most are ""holding it together"" by ""raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves"".""Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change,"" he said.In Scotland, council tax policy is the responsibility of the Holyrood government but the 32 local councils set the rates and collect the duties.Authorities were discouraged from increasing rates for a period of nine years via the threat of financial penalties, but this central freeze was ended in 2017. Most councils have now opted to raise taxes by up to the 3% permitted.In Wales, the Welsh Government settlement assumes a rise of 2.5% in council tax on average. There is no official cap, but there is an informal limit of 5% which was set ministers. So far, this has not been exceeded, although last month Pembrokeshire County Council said it was considering a rise of 12.5%. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, the body which speaks for local councils, added that some authorities are ""perilously close"" to financial collapse.""Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps,"" he said.""Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face.""This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.""A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said its finance settlement ""strikes a balance"" between relieving pressure on councils and ensuring taxpayers ""do not face excessive bills"".""Overall, councils will see a real-term increase in resources over the next two years, more freedom and fairness and with a greater certainty to plan and secure value for money,"" he said.He added that more control had also been given to councils over the business rates they raise locally so ""millions of pounds"" could stay in communities.Do you have a question about this story?

2018-02-08,"EU leaked paper discourteous, says Davis",https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42994640,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDavid Davis has described a leaked EU paper suggesting it could cut UK access to the single market if there was a post-Brexit row as ""discourteous"".A draft document leaked on Wednesday suggested any dispute could mean UK benefits being suspended in the ""transition period"" after Brexit. The UK Brexit secretary said it had not been ""in good faith"" to publish it.He also said every economic forecast about Brexit had been ""proven wrong so far"".Official forecasts out earlier suggested it would mean a slowdown in growth across the UK.Mr Davis was speaking after the prime minister chaired meetings of the Brexit cabinet committee, aimed at sketching out what the UK wanted its future relationship with the EU to look like. He said the atmosphere had been ""very constructive"" and there had been ""lots of things resolved"" but admitted there was ""still progress to be made"". He described the draft section of the withdrawal agreement that leaked out on Wednesday as ""hardly a legal document, it was a political document"".""What we're about, is building an implementation period which is to build a bridge to a future where we work well together,"" he said. ""I do not think it was in good faith to publish a document with frankly discourteous language and implying that they could arbitrarily terminate in effect the implementation period. ""That's not what the aim of this exercise is. It's not in good faith. We think it was unwise to publish that.""The transition - or implementation - period is expected to begin straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union, on 29 March 2019, and end on 31 December 2020.The UK says this will allow businesses to adapt to its new relationship with the EU. The EU says its rules should still apply during the transition period, as will rulings of the European Court of Justice.According to a footnote in the EU papers leaked to journalists in Brussels, if referring a dispute to the EU court during that period took too long, the withdrawal agreement ""should provide for a mechanism allowing the union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market"".Mr Davis was also asked about UK officials' economic forecasts that model the 15-year impact of the UK:The government agreed to show them to MPs, following a leak of some of the information to Buzzfeed last week.The estimates suggested north-east England and the West Midlands would be hardest hit although others would also see a slowdown in growth.But Mr Davis said: ""Every single financial or economic forecast related to Brexit has proven wrong so far, massively wrong - all on the same side, all underestimating the progress of the economy. ""[The] second point is that this is a work in progress. This is not a complete policy document.""You wouldn't drive a car that is half finished. You shouldn't use a forecast that is half complete."" A Downing street source said the prime minister had told the Brexit cabinet committee that her starting point was to aim for ""something that hadn't been done before in order to come to a new relationship that will last a generation or more"". Meanwhile Italian MEP Roberto Gualtieri, who sits on the European Parliament's Brexit steering committee, said it was unlikely, during the transition period, that Britain would have to follow any new EU rules drawn up when it was no longer a member state.He said it was unlikely there would be time for new legislation to be brought forward within the period - expected to be around two years - because of European Parliament elections in 2019 and the fact a new European Commission would not be in place until autumn that year.David Davis says the UK will seek an ""appropriate process"" to object to any new laws introduced during the period.But Mr Gualtieri said the UK was likely to have had its say as a member state on any new EU rules that come into force during that period."
2018-02-08,May kicks Brexit can down the road,https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42989884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAnother gathering in Downing Street has come and gone, imagined at one point to be a ""crunch meeting"" at which Cabinet colleagues might thrash out their differences on the destination of Brexit. In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."

""I have never had television, either as a child or as an adult,"" he told MPs, and although it has a place it should not be the ""centre of family life"".""I have discovered a great game called Bananagram, which is brilliant for families, for those who enjoy that kind of thing,"" he said.He even joked that the cabinet could benefit from a few rounds of the game, which consists of a yellow banana-shaped bag of letter tiles, adding that it ""might be more productive than some of the conversations that are had"".The game, which shares features with Scrabble and other word games, was invented in 2007 and originally marketed as the ""anagram game that will drive you bananas!"". Mr Lefroy also stressed the importance of the wider community in providing a stable environment for children.The former accountant, who spent 11 years in Tanzania working in the coffee industry before becoming an MP, quoted an African proverb in Swahili, which he translated as ""it takes a whole village to raise a child"".Labour MP Margaret Greenwood, shadow spokesman for work and pensions, cautioned against putting too much emphasis on traditional families. saying there are ""many different types of family"".Commenting on the government's recent green paper Improving Lives, Helping Working Families. which stresses the impact parental relationship breakdown can have on children, she said: ""It does read like some sort of fairy tale that ignores the impact of government policies since 2010.""And the way it has made life so much harder for so many families, especially those on low incomes.""

Best for Britain chairman Lord Malloch-Brown, a former Labour minister, said Mr Soros was a ""valued"" supporter but small donors had contributed more. Mr Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, made a fortune in 1992 betting against sterling on Black Wednesday, forcing then-PM John Major to take the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.He has previously suggested it was possible that the UK would apply to rejoin the European Union soon after Brexit.According to the Telegraph, the donation was made through Mr Soros's Open Society FoundationBest for Britain was co-founded by Gina Miller, who took the UK government to court in 2016 over its triggering of the Article 50 process to leave the EU. A judge ruled Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit. Mrs Miller left Best for Britain last June.Lord Malloch-Brown confirmed Mr Soros's contribution but said some of the campaign's other major donors had given more.He added Best for Britain had followed rules governing financial contributions.He said: ""We have never hidden our agenda; we have been campaigning hard to win a meaningful vote on Brexit, which we did, and to keep all options on the table, including staying in the European Union.""He said the campaign was a ""democratic and patriotic effort to recover our future and we welcome support for our efforts from many quarters"".The involvement of Mr Soros was reported in the Daily Telegraph in a story co-written by Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy.In an article in the paper, Mr Timothy maintained the objective of the campaign was ""to convince MPs to vote against the deal Theresa May negotiates with Brussels, regardless of its content"".He said: ""Malloch-Brown and his backers believe that, if Parliament rejects the Brexit deal, the government will fall, and Brexit can then be stopped."""
2018-02-08,Japan warns on Brexit 'high stakes',https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42994603,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJapan's ambassador to the UK has said Brexit is a high stakes issue and that no company would be able to stay in the UK if it was not profitable.Koji Tsuruoka was speaking outside Number 10 after a meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May and 19 top Japanese bosses.Mrs May had told the business leaders that Brexit would allow the UK to strike a free trade deal with Japan.She said the government's industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"".However, Mr Tsuruoka told journalists: ""If there is no profitability of continuing operations in the UK - not Japanese only - no private company can continue operations. So it is as simple as that."" He was asked about the threat to Japanese companies if the UK did not secure a frictionless trade deal with the EU after Brexit. ""This is all high stakes that all of us, I think, need to keep in mind,"" he answered.    Pro-Brexit businessman John Mills, said: ""Clearly companies have to make a profit.""But there's no reason they shouldn't make a profit with a WTO [World Trade Organisation] deal,"" added Mr Mills, who is chairman of consumer products firm, JML.During the meeting Mrs May told attendees from companies including Mitsubishi, Honda, Nissan, Toyota and Panasonic that Brexit was ""no small undertaking"".She also said the government's modern industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"".""Just today we have seen the Bank of England raise its forecast for UK growth compared with its estimates three months ago,"" Mrs May added.The meeting comes amid concern over estimates of the impact of Brexit on economic growth.Chancellor Phillip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox were also at the meeting.""I recognise that the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union is no small undertaking, but importantly it does present the opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world and build on our already very strong relationship that we have with Japan,"" Mrs May told the assembled bosses.  ""As we look to the relationship between the UK and Japan we see already year-on-year trade between our two countries continues to increase, with Japans's investment in the UK reaching £46.5 billion in 2016.""Alongside the car companies Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi and Toyota, representatives from Japanese banks and drug companies were also due to attend the meeting.Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over the past decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent.Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their UK operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars. The big majority of these are exported.The motor industry has expressed concern that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10% and be subject to customs delays after Britain leaves the European Union.Japanese drug companies have also made Britain their European base. Some are concerned about future drug regulations, with any divergence with the EU likely to pose regulatory challenges. London is also home to Japanese banks, such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. Like other foreign banks, they are keen to know about trading and so-called ""passporting"" arrangements for access to the EU.In 2016 Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May amid fears over the future of its production plant in Sunderland.Nissan sought assurances over post-Brexit arrangements ahead of future investment in the Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest car factory."
2018-02-08,UK will not block Bermuda gay marriage repeal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42990122,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has said it would not be ""appropriate"" to block Bermuda's decision to repeal same-sex marriage.On Wednesday the British overseas territory became the first country in the world to pass, and then revoke, the law, replacing gay marriage with domestic partnerships.The decision also means cruise ships registered in Bermuda are likely to be banned from hosting same-sex weddings.Theresa May said the UK's dealings with Bermuda should be based on ""respect"".But critics say the law reversal will make the UK an international ""laughing stock"".The Atlantic island, which is home to 60,000 people, legalised marriage between homosexual couples in May 2017, following a Supreme Court ruling.But the new Domestic Partnership Act, approved by Bermuda Governor John Rankin on Wednesday, rolls back the legalisation. Instead of marriage, the act allows gay or straight couples to form a partnership, which the Bermuda government says carries equivalent rights.According to Bermuda's minister of home affairs, Walton Brown, the majority of Bermudians do not agree with gay couples marrying.He said: ""The act is intended to strike a fair balance between two currently irreconcilable groups in Bermuda, by restating that marriage must be between a male and a female while at the same time recognising and protecting the rights of same-sex couples.""Because of Bermuda's status as an overseas dependent territory, the UK government had the power to block the law change.But Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin told MPs: ""After full and careful consideration in regards to Bermuda's constitutional and international obligations, the Secretary decided that in these circumstances it would not be appropriate to use this power to block legislation, which can only can be used where there is a legal or constitutional basis for doing so, and even then only in exceptional circumstances.""Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""seriously disappointed"" about the decision to abolish same-sex marriage.But she added: ""That bill has been democratically passed by the Parliament of Bermuda, and our relationship with the overseas territories is based on partnership and respect for their right to democratic self-government.""MPs on all sides criticised the decision and called it a backward step.Labour MP Chris Bryant said the law reversal will make Britain a ""laughing stock in the international human rights field"".So @BorisJohnson has granted permission to Bermuda to abolish same sex marriage. This totally undermines UK effort to advance LGBT rights.End of Twitter post  by @RhonddaBryantRaising the issue in the Commons as an urgent question, Mr Bryant added: ""Same-sex Bermudian couples who have been married under the ruling of the Bermudian Supreme Court have now been rendered an anomaly. ""Gay and lesbian Bermudians have been told that they aren't quite equal to everyone else.""The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: ""The problem, as many MPs pointed out, is that Britain may now find it harder to promote LGBT rights around the world when it has failed to do so in one of its own overseas territories.""The cruise companies Cunard and P&O Cruises, both of which register their ships in Bermuda, said they were ""very unhappy"" about the change in legislation, which will outlaw same-sex marriage ceremonies on their liners.""We do not underestimate the disappointment this will cause those guests who have planned their weddings,"" the companies said in an identically-worded statement.Instead, the firms will offering same-sex couples on-board alternative ""commitment"" ceremonies.Same-sex marriage is legal in 26 countries around the world and will soon become authorised in two more nations - Austria and Taiwan, which is the first ruling of its kind in Asia.The Netherlands was the first country to legalise same-sex marriage in 2001.

The project known as the Haringey Development Vehicle (HDV) has caused division in the Labour-led Haringey Council. The authority said it welcomed the judgment but the final decision to establish the HDV would be taken by a future administration.The complainants are planning to appeal.The legal challenge was brought by a group of Haringey residents who said the council failed in its public sector equality duty, its duty to consult properly and should have made the decision in full council rather than the cabinet.But in his judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Ouseley concluded it should be rejected ""on all grounds"".Council leader Claire Kober, who agreed the scheme with the authority's cabinet in July 2017, announced in January that she is stepping down as leader over the row. The public private partnership to redevelop Northumberland Park, a large council estate, and build 6,400 new homes has proved hugely divisive within the Haringey Labour Party, and came to national attention when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn signalled his misgivings at last year's party conference.Labour's National Executive Committee in January called on the authority to halt the scheme following campaigning against it by Momentum.Opponents to the HDV say it could lead to social cleansing and give too much power to a private company, while supporters argue it will bring much needed private funds into the regeneration of a deprived area.Ms Kober told the Andrew Marr show that councils ""simply do not have the powers, resources or expertise"" to deal with the housing crisis on their own.The council said in a statement that establishing the HDV remains its ""agreed approach"" and that it is ""committed to delivering the new homes, jobs and community facilities""."

It has done much good in that time.""But come today, anybody looking at the size of the reserves and pay packages would question the direction Motability has taken in allowing this to happen.""And with the current focus on corporate governance issues and the use of public money, I have today asked the National Audit Office to give consideration to undertake an investigation into this matter.""After the initial report in the Daily Mail earlier this week, Motability issued a statement denying having a ""spare"" £2.4bn, saying that the money is not held as cash but is used to buy cars.""This reduces the amount of borrowing required... underpins the scheme's financial stability, protecting it from the business risks it faces, particularly in relation to used car values,"" it said in the statement.On chief executive Mike Betts' pay, the charity said it was ""reviewed against the market to ensure that it is both competitive over the long term and to ensure that any rewards are related to performance especially in relation to the quality of service provided"".

His father was found dead in November four days after being sacked from government and suspended by Labour following allegations, which he denied, about his personal conduct towards women.Mr Jones has been criticised for his handling of the sacking and Paul Bowen QC is currently leading an independent inquiry into the matter.Asked by political commentator Gareth Hughes in a podcast if Wales would have a new first minister this year, Ms Rathbone replied: ""There are certainly plenty of runners and riders already declaring their hand.""So it's certainly on the agenda.""Economy Secretary Ken Skates told BBC One's Wales Live programme on Wednesday that Jack Sargeant's win was for the ""whole Labour movement"" but he could not deny there had been ""tensions"".Asked if the first minister had the support of Labour assembly members, Mr Skates said: ""I can tell you there is no movement against him.""I know there is always speculation about who is going to be next, who is the next leader? There's nothing new in that. ""I know that there will be a lot of speculation but the fact is Jack's going to be coming down next week. He is focused on delivery for the people of Alyn and Deeside.""Carwyn Jones told BBC Wales on Thursday that he looked forward to working with the new Labour AM, although he said he had not yet had a chance to speak to him following his victory.""There's no problem from my perspective and I want to make sure that Jack develops into a hugely effective assembly member for Alyn and Deeside,"" he said.Asked why he failed to join Mr Sargeant on the campaign trail when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did, Mr Jones said: ""Time was part of the problem.""He added: ""There are no tensions.""The team worked very well and we see that in the result - the best result for Welsh Labour in any assembly election [in Alyn and Deeside] and that's a tribute to all the people who worked so hard on the ground.""Irish lawyer James Hamilton is leading a separate inquiry into whether Mr Jones misled the assembly last November, when the first minister said no one at the top of his government had complained about bullying back in 2014.On the podcast, Ms Rathbone was asked if she had seen signs of bullying in the Welsh Government as chair of a committee overseeing use of EU funds in Wales in 2015.She said: ""Not in carrying out my duties on that committee, no, but there certainly were people who didn't take kindly to anybody challenging their position.""They were mini-dictators.""So yes, I wouldn't be surprised at the remarks made by others that there was bullying going on.""A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said:  ""Something must be very wrong for senior Labour AMs to talk of 'mini-dictators' at the heart of their own government. ""And it's now open season on Carwyn Jones - with Labour AMs publicly admitting that an imminent change of First Minister is on the agenda.""A spokesman for the Welsh Labour Government responded: ""Jenny Rathbone confirmed that she had never witnessed any bullying.

Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."

So for those still stuck on the launch pad, here is a very quick guide to what's going on.We are still on course to leave the European Union on 29 March next year. No-one can agree on what happens after that though.If the government gets its way, the answer will be very little, in the short-term at least. Brexit Secretary David Davis - in full Neil Armstrong mode - wants to bring the country in for a soft landing.Businesses need time to adjust, he says, so he wants a two-year transition period, which will feel very much like staying in the EU. He wants the UK and EU to agree a deal on that by March. Then the really difficult bit begins - negotiating a new relationship with Germany, France and the rest of the EU.Prime Minister Theresa May wants to end free movement of people into the UK. She also doesn't want the UK to be told what to do by European judges. But she also wants businesses to be able to trade pretty much as they do now across the EU.This sounds to some in Brussels like ""cherry picking"" - not their favourite activity. They say that the ability to trade across the EU without tariffs is one of the benefits of being a member of the club. If the UK leaves, they say, it can't expect to have the same terms. But Mrs May has yet to spell out what she wants in any detail.Whatever she says is guaranteed to disappoint a section of her party, threatening her already precarious premiership.But if she doesn't act soon, the EU will start filling in the blanks itself.It wants a rough outline of a trade deal by this October - to put it to a vote in the European Parliament and get it ratified by the remaining 27 EU members in time for Brexit day. There will also be a vote in the Commons.And we haven't even mentioned those campaigning for another referendum..."

There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."
2018-02-08,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-08,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180208200643/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-09,Barnier: Brexit transition 'not a given',https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43001931,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 is ""not a given"".He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"".And he said the UK decision to quit the customs union and single market meant Irish border checks were ""unavoidable"".David Davis said he was ""surprised"" to hear Mr Barnier was unclear on the UK's stance on the transition period.""We are seeking a time-limited period that maintains access to each other's markets on existing terms,"" said the UK's chief Brexit negotiator.He suggested there was a ""fundamental contradiction"" in the approach the European Commission was taking to Brexit talks.""Today they acknowledged that a way to resolve disputes and infringements is needed. ""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways.""Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year.And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations.But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day.""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier.He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"".""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given.""By BBC Political Correspondent Leila NathooThis was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones.Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business.""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"".But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"".Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"".The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind.""On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.""Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December.But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question.The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU.To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table.Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel.But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal."""
2018-02-09,Stormont deal could be unveiled in days,https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43006235,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere is growing speculation that a deal to end the year-long political deadlock at Stormont could be unveiled as early as next week. Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin last January.  On Friday, both parties stayed away from scheduled round-table talks.Instead, British and Irish ministers met the three smaller parties - Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance.The politicians were told by Northern Ireland Office officials that the discussions involving the DUP and Sinn Féin are at ""a critical stage"".  It is understood that the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has been meeting Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill and incoming party president Mary Lou McDonald elsewhere in Stormont's Parliament Buildings.The new Sinn Féin leadership is due to take over from Gerry Adams at the weekend, and some sources believe the parties might feel ready to move forward after that transition has been completed. Whilst the outline of an agreement is thought to be in place, neither of the two big parties have yet signed up. One informed source suggested that some DUP MPs have yet to be convinced.In a statement on Friday night, the DUP leader said ""progress has been made"" but added that there was ""more work to do"". ""I have set out the parameters for a deal. It must be fair and balanced,"" Mrs Foster added.""Our negotiating team will continue working next week. I want to see ministerial-led government restored to Northern Ireland. ""I hope that can be achieved by devolved government and will work towards that end.""On his last night as leader of Sinn Féin, the outgoing party president Gerry Adams said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak. ""We have made some progress but there are still considerable obstacles but as I said to our unionist friends, this is the last chance agreement.""Both the DUP and Sinn Féin have previously said that the talks process cannot continue indefinitely.The smaller parties expressed their frustration at the fact that not all the five parties attended Friday's talks.The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, told the two governments: ""You've got my number, give me a call when something is happening.""In a later statement, he said: ""The truth is, this isn't an all-party process. It is an exclusive two-party process.""The SDLP are not here to window dress but we want to be constructive. I've told both governments when the two-party process is concluded and they are ready to engage in five-party negotiations the SDLP will be ready to negotiate.""Meanwhile, an Ulster Unionist source said the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, told them: ""I feel your frustration"". It is understood the UUP leader, Robin Swann, replied: ""I am not here for a counselling session. I am here to get a government up and running"".Earlier, it emerged that the prime minister has been considering flying over to Belfast next week if that will help the talks.Last month, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said both he and Theresa May were happy to get engaged personally, if they thought it would make a difference. The details of any potential deal remain unclear. It is thought the parties have been examining how to resolve their differences over Irish language legislation. Previously, the Alliance party has suggested that a package of separate bills dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and other languages might break the impasse.DUP negotiators are understood to be keen to ensure there should be no repeat of last year's breakdown of devolution. They have suggested that some way to make the Stormont institutions more sustainable should be introduced.There has also been discussion of changes to the operation of the assembly's controversial ""petition of concern"" system, which was designed to safeguard minorities but has been used to block a number of measures.Earlier this week, the government rejected a suggestion from Labour that the issue of same sex marriage should be taken off the talks agenda and dealt with directly via Westminster legislation. However, some sources suggest the idea could be altered so that Westminster might take over the issue if the assembly can not deal with it within a set period of time.  "

Proposals accepted by the government include mandatory training for MPs who have bullied or harassed employees.But some are concerned the grievance procedure focuses too much on the parliamentary estate. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom insisted constituency offices would be covered by the new behaviour code.A cross-party committee set up in response to widespread allegations of sexual harassment has recommended a range of sanctions, which MPs will be asked to approve by the end of February.One aide to a Labour MP told the BBC: ""I spend most of my time in the constituency office, along with the rest of my boss's staff. We feel quite left out of the whole situation.""He said he had seen ""intimidation and poor treatment"" in three different constituency offices, where staff interaction ""is often one-on-one and unseen"".Andrea Leadsom, who will oversee implementation of the new procedure, emphasised it would be able to meet these concerns.One key measure recommended by the committee is a code of conduct for all who work in or for Parliament, covering ""behaviours that contribute to bullying and harassment and sexual harassment"".But Mrs Leadsom acknowledged ""the main focus of the problem we're seeking to solve is on the parliamentary estate"". The committee's report contains the admission that it had ""not taken sufficient evidence and advice"" regarding constituencies and should be ""an area for early future action"".Staff were also concerned that the proposals do not change the terms of employment of staff, who will still be directly employed by MPs, who, in effect, operate as small-business owners.One member of staff said that ""unless there's a better solution to the directly-employed-by-member system I don't think these sticking plasters can fix the culture"".Andrea Leadsom stressed the independence of the proposed sexual violence adviser who would be able to decide on appropriate action. However, the BBC was also told of problems with the existing independent investigations procedure for employees of the Houses of Parliament, as opposed to those working for MPs or parties.The BBC understands it has only been used a handful of times and ""does not inspire confidence"". The House of Commons said in a statement: ""The House takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously and provides a range of advice and support services which are available to members' staff."""

""I have never had television, either as a child or as an adult,"" he told MPs, and although it has a place it should not be the ""centre of family life"".""I have discovered a great game called Bananagram, which is brilliant for families, for those who enjoy that kind of thing,"" he said.He even joked that the cabinet could benefit from a few rounds of the game, which consists of a yellow banana-shaped bag of letter tiles, adding that it ""might be more productive than some of the conversations that are had"".The game, which shares features with Scrabble and other word games, was invented in 2007 and originally marketed as the ""anagram game that will drive you bananas!"". Mr Lefroy also stressed the importance of the wider community in providing a stable environment for children.The former accountant, who spent 11 years in Tanzania working in the coffee industry before becoming an MP, quoted an African proverb in Swahili, which he translated as ""it takes a whole village to raise a child"".Labour MP Margaret Greenwood, shadow spokesman for work and pensions, cautioned against putting too much emphasis on traditional families. saying there are ""many different types of family"".Commenting on the government's recent green paper Improving Lives, Helping Working Families. which stresses the impact parental relationship breakdown can have on children, she said: ""It does read like some sort of fairy tale that ignores the impact of government policies since 2010.""And the way it has made life so much harder for so many families, especially those on low incomes.""

The details were contained in the government's response to a review of working practices. The Taylor Review into working practices, published last year, concentrated particularly on the so-called gig economy of part time and flexible workers.However, it also highlighted the issue of unpaid internships.It said the government should ensure that ""exploitative unpaid internships which damage social mobility in the UK, are stamped out"".In its response released earlier this week, the government said it accepted the recommendations of the review. ""Exploitative unpaid internships should not exist and we will work to eradicate these.""We will take action to improve the interpretation of the law and the enforcement action taken by HMRC in this area to help stamp out illegal unpaid internships,"" it added.According to the law, interns who are classed as workers must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage.A worker might be someone who has a contract or is subject to sanctions if they do not turn up for work.   Genuine volunteers on the other hand are not entitled to the minimum wage. The government said HMRC already contacted employers who had advertised for unpaid internships to ""ensure they are aware and compliant with the law"". However, a fresh crackdown took place in the last three months.It also said it would ""formally ask"" HMRC to focus activity in the coming year on firms which use unpaid interns, ""through intelligence-led enforcement"".""If this approach does not work, the government will review the existing policy and legal framework and will consider what other action can be taken"", it added.Last month the Sutton Trust charity estimated that 40% of 70,000 internships undertaken annually were unpaid - but said young workers need a minimum of £1,019 per month to live in London and £827 in Manchester.It backed cross-party calls to ban unpaid internships over a month long."
2018-02-09,MPs urge more housing help for elderly,https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42997705,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOlder people should be given more help with housing to help them stay healthy and reduce the need for residential care, a committee of MPs has said.They called for the government to develop a new national strategy to deal with older people's housing needs.Proposals include funding for a handyman service, ""age proofing"" all new build homes and a national helpline to offer advice on housing options.The government said it had an ambitious plan to boost housing for everyone.According to the Commons communities and local government committee report, 18% of the population was 65 or older in 2016 and the number of people aged 85 and over was set to double to nearly 5% over the next 25 years.It said that being in an ""appropriate, comfortable and well-located home"" could have knock-on effects on people's health and independence.But while a ""sizeable minority"" of people would like to move in later life, the ""practical, financial and emotional aspects of moving home prevent or delay them from doing so"". The estimated direct cost of moving house in the UK is £8,451 the report said. Claudia Wood, of the think tank Demos, told the committee moving was an exhausting process, compounded by the fact that: ""People do not look for a retirement property when they are 60 and particularly capable of moving and quite happy to do so. They look at it when they are 75 or 80.""For the majority, who want to stay in their homes, more could be done to carry out small repairs and adapt properties to ensure the properties remain ""comfortable, healthy and safe"", the report said.  It recommended that the government's National Planning Policy Framework for England be amended to encourage more housing to be built specifically for older people. And it said there should be a new national strategy for older people - linked to the upcoming green paper on social care.All new homes should be ""age proofed"" so they are suitable for older people's needs, a telephone advice service should be set up and extra funding should be made available for home improvement agencies to operate handyman schemes for older people, MPs said.There should be a wider range of housing to suit people's needs and preferences, as evidence heard by MPs suggested a shortage of accessible and specialist housing and bungalows were being built.But the committee was not convinced of the need to have a stamp duty exemption for older people moving to smaller properties, arguing it would be difficult to implement and was not the ""main barrier"" to older people not wanting to move. Chairman Clive Betts said: ""With an ageing population, it's vital that the link between housing and health and social care is recognised.""The right kind of housing can help people stay healthy and support them to live independently. This can help reduce the need for home or residential care, bringing real benefits to the individual and also relieving pressure on the health service.""The Local Government Association welcomed the report and said there was a ""chronic shortage of homes suitable to support our ageing population"" - with housing for elderly people currently making up just 6% of councils' housing stock.A government spokesman said: ""We've set out an ambitious programme of reforms to boost housing supply for everyone - including elderly people.""We're also committed to helping older and disabled people live independently and safely and we're providing funding to help local housing authorities make a range of adaptations to a disabled or elderly person's home, such as installing ramps and stair lifts."""

Not because I'm a bit odd, because that's literally all they had to show MSPs until the last half hour of the day.End of Twitter post  by @Ross_GreerScottish Brexit minister Mike Russell had previously said that he would publish the UK government's Brexit analysis if he was given it, saying the public ""have a right to know"".He said ministers had ""refused to accept a copy on condition of secrecy"", and suggested the reading room was an ""unsubtle response"" to his pledge to publish the papers.After Green co-convener Patrick Harvie raised a point of order about the ""extraordinarily limited"" provisions, Mr Macintosh said he ""fully understands"" concerns.He said the arrangements ""offer limited opportunity for scrutiny"" of the papers, and said the late notice of their availability was ""unhelpful"", urging the UK government to ""reflect"" on this.A UK government spokeswoman said the letter had made reference to the rooms being available ""from"" Thursday, saying they had ""wanted to give MSPs the opportunity to view the document before recess"".She added: ""If MSPs would like to return to review the document at any point, including after recess, they would be very welcome to do so""."
2018-02-09,Council tax hikes planned 'across England',https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-42984368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNearly all local authorities in England are set to raise council tax and service charges amid concerns for their financial stability, a survey suggests.Council tax is set to rise in 95% of authorities while 93% will hike service fees, according to the 2018 State of Local Government Finance research.The planned increases come as 80% of councils fear for their balance sheets. Last week, Northamptonshire County Council banned all new spending and said its financial future was ""grave"".Council tax can rise by 3% this year, in line with inflation, before a referendum is triggered, although the largest authorities are to be allowed to increase it by up to 5.99%.Local authorities also oversee charges for services such as parking, burials and planning and 93% of respondents to the survey indicated new or increased fees in order to make ends meet. Central government funding has come under fire as a result, with councils said to be calling for a ""fundamental redesign of the financial system"".The research - carried out by the Local Government Information Unit (LGiU) think tank and The Municipal Journal - claims the biggest pressure on authorities' budgets is children's services (nearly 32% of councils), then adult social care (close to 28%) and housing and homelessness (19%).In the 113 councils that responded to the survey, a third of all those in England, social care was found to be the greatest long-term pressure. Additionally, councils are uncertain about what monies they will receive after 2020 as decisions over business rates and the Fair Funding Review are yet to be decided, the report found.Of those 113 respondents, just six said they would not raise council tax. Of those six, only East Hampshire District Council agreed to be identified.On Friday, it emerged Northamptonshire County Council had imposed emergency controls on its spending in order to address ""severe financial challenges"". The move, known as a section 114 notice, is issued when a council does not have enough money to meet its expenditure. It is the first local authority in 20 years to resort to the measure. The Conservative-run council has projected overspend of £21.1m for 2017-18 and its chief financial officer warned predictions for the following year were ""grave"".On Tuesday, Surrey County Council (SCC) agreed a 6% rise in its council tax in the face of a £105m funding gap, according to analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, as reported in The Times.In February 2017, the Tory-led authority threatened to impose a 15% increase in council tax in order to deal with its deficit - which would have triggered a referendum - but then found itself at the centre of  a political row over a so-called ""sweetheart deal"" from the government. Analysis by Daniel Wainwright, BBC England data journalist How much you pay in council tax depends on where you live and how expensive your house would have been when the system was first drawn up, in 1991. Police and crime commissioners and fire authorities all add to the bill and in areas with county, district and parish councils, each tier of local government will have its own precept.Band A homes, those that would have been of the lowest value, will pay the least and Band H will pay the most.When all these bills and different bands of housing are taken into account, eight of the 10 areas with the highest average council tax bills are in Surrey. People in the Elmbridge district will pay almost £2,000 per home.Despite this, the county council is still facing a £105 million funding gap.While London is known for being expensive, particularly when it comes to housing, it has some of the lowest council tax bills in the country.People in Wandsworth pay an average of £645 a year per household. In Westminster, where the average property price is more than £1 million, people pay an average of £724 a year.A spokesman for SCC, which serves the UK's richest county in terms of high net-worth individuals, said: ""We've been successfully managing the growing need for adult social care, children's and other key services partly through making savings of £540m since 2010 and have made sure we keep within our overall budget.""Councils in England get their money from:The money is then spent on:Source: BBC Reality CheckJonathan Carr-West, chief executive of LGiU, claimed the survey showed that councils ""are on the edge"" and most are ""holding it together"" by ""raising council tax, increasing charging and draining their reserves"".""Councils are calling for assurances around funding for the next three years and for a fundamental redesign of the finance system. At present government is offering neither. That has to change,"" he said.In Scotland, council tax policy is the responsibility of the Holyrood government but the 32 local councils set the rates and collect the duties.Authorities were discouraged from increasing rates for a period of nine years via the threat of financial penalties, but this central freeze was ended in 2017. Most councils have now opted to raise taxes by up to the 3% permitted.In Wales, the Welsh Government settlement assumes a rise of 2.5% in council tax on average. There is no official cap, but there is an informal limit of 5% which was set ministers. So far, this has not been exceeded, although last month Pembrokeshire County Council said it was considering a rise of 12.5%. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, the body which speaks for local councils, added that some authorities are ""perilously close"" to financial collapse.""Many will have to make tough decisions about which services have to be scaled back or stopped altogether to plug funding gaps,"" he said.""Extra council tax raising powers will helpfully give some councils the option to raise some extra income but will not bring in enough to completely ease the financial pressure they face.""This means many councils face having to ask residents to pay more council tax while offering fewer services as a result.""A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said its finance settlement ""strikes a balance"" between relieving pressure on councils and ensuring taxpayers ""do not face excessive bills"".""Overall, councils will see a real-term increase in resources over the next two years, more freedom and fairness and with a greater certainty to plan and secure value for money,"" he said.He added that more control had also been given to councils over the business rates they raise locally so ""millions of pounds"" could stay in communities.Do you have a question about this story?

Best for Britain chairman Lord Malloch-Brown, a former Labour minister, said Mr Soros was a ""valued"" supporter but small donors had contributed more. Mr Soros, a Hungarian-born US citizen, made a fortune in 1992 betting against sterling on Black Wednesday, forcing then-PM John Major to take the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.He has previously suggested it was possible that the UK would apply to rejoin the European Union soon after Brexit.According to the Telegraph, the donation was made through Mr Soros's Open Society FoundationBest for Britain was co-founded by Gina Miller, who took the UK government to court in 2016 over its triggering of the Article 50 process to leave the EU. A judge ruled Parliament must give its consent before Theresa May can start official talks on the terms of the UK's exit. Mrs Miller left Best for Britain last June.Lord Malloch-Brown confirmed Mr Soros's contribution but said some of the campaign's other major donors had given more.He added Best for Britain had followed rules governing financial contributions.He said: ""We have never hidden our agenda; we have been campaigning hard to win a meaningful vote on Brexit, which we did, and to keep all options on the table, including staying in the European Union.""He said the campaign was a ""democratic and patriotic effort to recover our future and we welcome support for our efforts from many quarters"".The involvement of Mr Soros was reported in the Daily Telegraph in a story co-written by Theresa May's former chief of staff Nick Timothy.In an article in the paper, Mr Timothy maintained the objective of the campaign was ""to convince MPs to vote against the deal Theresa May negotiates with Brussels, regardless of its content"".He said: ""Malloch-Brown and his backers believe that, if Parliament rejects the Brexit deal, the government will fall, and Brexit can then be stopped."""

In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."
2018-02-09,"Hey, big overspenders",https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42958465,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Northamptonshire County Council has said it is in financial trouble and is banning all new spending, raising questions about the financial health of local authorities across England. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""The BBC's analysis compares what councils estimated they would spend on services with what they actually spent.However some of the spending would have been off-set by government grants or savings.Selby District Council in Yorkshire said that despite government figures showing it spent £4.6m more on services than estimated at the start of the financial year, it finished 2016-17 with a £400,000 saving.The council said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term"" and had been given a ""clean bill of health"" by auditors.South Hams District Council in Devon said it would spend £31.5m on services in 2016-17 but reported spending £38m.The council said government grants covered most of the additional spending.However, it was still left with a £45,000 overspend, equivalent to 0.5% of the budget.From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."
2018-02-09,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42977661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: There are 21,000 fewer police officers.Reality Check verdict: That's about right - under the Conservative and coalition governments, the number of police officers has fallen by somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000.What's happening to policing and crime is a regular topic at Prime Minister's Questions, when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn goes head-to-head with Theresa May.Mr Corbyn asked: ""With crime rising, does the prime minister regret cutting 21,000 police officers?""Whether crime is rising or not is harder than you might imagine to determine. There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."
2018-02-09,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-09,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180209195058/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-10,Public ownership will cost nothing - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43014861,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Labour's proposal to bring services such as water, energy and rail into public ownership would be ""cost free"", John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor says he wants to put public services ""irreversibly in the hands of workers"" so they can ""never again be taken away"".In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell said privatisation had failed. However, the Conservatives said his plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services.Earlier, Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme taking services into public ownership would not ultimately increase the burden on taxpayers because government bonds could be swapped for shares in a revenue-producing company.""It would be cost free. You borrow to buy an asset and when that asset is producing profits like the water industry does, that will cover your borrowing cost,"" he said.A report earlier this week by the Social Market Foundation, commissioned by a group of water companies, estimated that the up-front costs of renationalisation would be £90bn.But Mr McDonnell said utilities could be managed more efficiently under public ownership, because they would no longer have to fund dividends for shareholders.""They've given out £18bn of dividends to their shareholders - sometimes they've actually given out more in dividends than they've made in profits,"" he told the BBC.In his speech to Labour's Alternative Models of Ownership conference, Mr McDonnell said the best way to protect public services for the long term was for them to be owned by the public.He said: ""The next Labour government will put democratically owned and managed public services irreversibly in the hands of workers and of those who rely on their work.""Public services could be made more responsive and effective by bringing together the people who use them, workers and expert managers, the shadow chancellor said.He said: ""We aren't going to take back control of these industries in order to put them into the hands of a remote bureaucracy, but to put them into the hands of all of you - so that they can never again be taken away.""Public ownership is not just a political decision, it's an economic necessity.""We'll move away from the failed privatisation model of the past, developing new democratic forms of ownership, joining other countries, regions and cities across the world in taking control of our essential services.""by Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondentIt's not unusual for private companies in trouble to do a ""debt for equity swap"". To save the business, those investors who own shares (equity) lose everything, and those investors who own the company's less risky bonds (debt) get those shares.Swapping government debt for private company shares is unusual though. In theory, the Treasury could issue new government bonds - known as gilts - and hand them over to the private owners of water or electricity companies. That would then make taxpayers shareholders in the utility in question.But all the existing contracts would continue in force. So salaries and bonuses would have to be honoured, as would contracts with all other private sector suppliers. The new owners (taxpayers) would also need to retain experienced staff to do often very specialised work. If those skilled staff thought they'd earn more in the private sector, that may be an issue.Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Labour would put politicians in charge of running everything from the phone lines to electricity supply, meaning people have nowhere to turn when things go wrong. That didn't work last time and won't work this time.""And UK business group the CBI said Labour's calls for nationalisation would ""wind the clock back on our economy"".Its managing director for people and infrastructure Neil Carberry said: ""If Labour turns its back on good collaboration between the government and the private sector, public services, infrastructure and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price.""In the speech, Mr McDonnell also announced the creation of a working group to look at how co-operatives can grow, expand and access funding, including the possibility of giving employees a greater right to own shares in the company they work for."
2018-02-10,Rohingya need safe way back - Johnson,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43014858,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMyanmar must find a safe and dignified way for Rohingya Muslims to return, the UK foreign secretary has said, after meeting the government of Bangladesh.Boris Johnson has been visiting camps on the Bangladesh border that hold the refugees who fled Myanmar to escape a military crackdown. Nearly 700,000 people have left since the action began last August. Mr Johnson will now fly to Myanmar, where he is due to meet de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Sunday.More than 500,000 refugees are currently living in Cox's Bazar camp in Bangladesh - equivalent in size to Leicester.Mr Johnson toured the camp and afterwards said the ""horrendous living conditions"" further strengthened his commitment to finding a solution.The foreign secretary paid tribute to the ""hospitality and compassion"" of the Bangladeshi government in providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya community, but emphasised refugee rights must be respected.""It is vital that the Rohingya refugees must be allowed to their homes in Rakhine voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, under international oversight, and when the conditions in Burma are right,"" he said.Earlier Mr Johnson met Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali.""I was really struck by how Bangladesh and the UK really share a common analysis of what needs to be done. We need to make those points together to the government in Naypydaw,"" he said.The United Nations has described the exodus of Rohingya people from Rakhine state, and the military offensive which provoked it, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".Neighbouring Bangladesh has agreed a timeframe with Myanmar for repatriating Rohingya people.But aid agencies have expressed concern over the projected figures for the transfer - Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week; Bangladesh says it aims to return everyone within two years.And the refugees are worried about the conditions and their rights upon their return. When Mr Johnson meets Ms Suu Kyi on Sunday he is expected to discuss the Rakhine crisis and press for the safe return of refugees.Mr Johnson will also meet the chair of the Advisory Board on the Rakhine Advisory Commission, Surakiart Sathirathai. It is looking at the problems in Rakhine state.Britain is one of the biggest direct donors of aid for the humanitarian effort to help the refugees. The foreign secretary's trip to Bangladesh is the first such official visit in a decade. He will go on to Bangkok, Thailand, for talks with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha."
2018-02-10,Stormont deal could be unveiled in days,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43006235,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere is growing speculation that a deal to end the year-long political deadlock at Stormont could be unveiled as early as next week. Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin last January.  On Friday, both parties stayed away from scheduled round-table talks.Instead, British and Irish ministers met the three smaller parties - Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance.The politicians were told by Northern Ireland Office officials that the discussions involving the DUP and Sinn Féin are at ""a critical stage"".  It is understood that the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has been meeting Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill and incoming party president Mary Lou McDonald elsewhere in Stormont's Parliament Buildings.The new Sinn Féin leadership is due to take over from Gerry Adams at the weekend, and some sources believe the parties might feel ready to move forward after that transition has been completed. Whilst the outline of an agreement is thought to be in place, neither of the two big parties have yet signed up. One informed source suggested that some DUP MPs have yet to be convinced.In a statement on Friday night, the DUP leader said ""progress has been made"" but added that there was ""more work to do"". ""I have set out the parameters for a deal. It must be fair and balanced,"" Mrs Foster added.""Our negotiating team will continue working next week. I want to see ministerial-led government restored to Northern Ireland. ""I hope that can be achieved by devolved government and will work towards that end.""On his last night as leader of Sinn Féin, the outgoing party president Gerry Adams said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak. ""We have made some progress but there are still considerable obstacles but as I said to our unionist friends, this is the last chance agreement.""Both the DUP and Sinn Féin have previously said that the talks process cannot continue indefinitely.The smaller parties expressed their frustration at the fact that not all the five parties attended Friday's talks.The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, told the two governments: ""You've got my number, give me a call when something is happening.""In a later statement, he said: ""The truth is, this isn't an all-party process. It is an exclusive two-party process.""The SDLP are not here to window dress but we want to be constructive. I've told both governments when the two-party process is concluded and they are ready to engage in five-party negotiations the SDLP will be ready to negotiate.""Meanwhile, an Ulster Unionist source said the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, told them: ""I feel your frustration"". It is understood the UUP leader, Robin Swann, replied: ""I am not here for a counselling session. I am here to get a government up and running"".Earlier, it emerged that the prime minister has been considering flying over to Belfast next week if that will help the talks.Last month, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said both he and Theresa May were happy to get engaged personally, if they thought it would make a difference. The details of any potential deal remain unclear. It is thought the parties have been examining how to resolve their differences over Irish language legislation. Previously, the Alliance party has suggested that a package of separate bills dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and other languages might break the impasse.DUP negotiators are understood to be keen to ensure there should be no repeat of last year's breakdown of devolution. They have suggested that some way to make the Stormont institutions more sustainable should be introduced.There has also been discussion of changes to the operation of the assembly's controversial ""petition of concern"" system, which was designed to safeguard minorities but has been used to block a number of measures.Earlier this week, the government rejected a suggestion from Labour that the issue of same sex marriage should be taken off the talks agenda and dealt with directly via Westminster legislation. However, some sources suggest the idea could be altered so that Westminster might take over the issue if the assembly can not deal with it within a set period of time.  "

""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways.""Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year.And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations.But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day.""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier.He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"".""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given.""By BBC Political Correspondent Leila NathooThis was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones.Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business.""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"".But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"".Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"".The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind.""On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.""Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December.But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question.The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU.To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table.Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel.But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal."""

2018-02-10,MPs' staff concern at anti-harassment plans,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42995752,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowStaff in MPs' constituency offices have told the BBC they ""feel left out"" of plans to tackle harassment at Westminster. Proposals accepted by the government include mandatory training for MPs who have bullied or harassed employees.But some are concerned the grievance procedure focuses too much on the parliamentary estate. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom insisted constituency offices would be covered by the new behaviour code.A cross-party committee set up in response to widespread allegations of sexual harassment has recommended a range of sanctions, which MPs will be asked to approve by the end of February.One aide to a Labour MP told the BBC: ""I spend most of my time in the constituency office, along with the rest of my boss's staff. We feel quite left out of the whole situation.""He said he had seen ""intimidation and poor treatment"" in three different constituency offices, where staff interaction ""is often one-on-one and unseen"".Andrea Leadsom, who will oversee implementation of the new procedure, emphasised it would be able to meet these concerns.One key measure recommended by the committee is a code of conduct for all who work in or for Parliament, covering ""behaviours that contribute to bullying and harassment and sexual harassment"".But Mrs Leadsom acknowledged ""the main focus of the problem we're seeking to solve is on the parliamentary estate"". The committee's report contains the admission that it had ""not taken sufficient evidence and advice"" regarding constituencies and should be ""an area for early future action"".Staff were also concerned that the proposals do not change the terms of employment of staff, who will still be directly employed by MPs, who, in effect, operate as small-business owners.One member of staff said that ""unless there's a better solution to the directly-employed-by-member system I don't think these sticking plasters can fix the culture"".Andrea Leadsom stressed the independence of the proposed sexual violence adviser who would be able to decide on appropriate action. However, the BBC was also told of problems with the existing independent investigations procedure for employees of the Houses of Parliament, as opposed to those working for MPs or parties.The BBC understands it has only been used a handful of times and ""does not inspire confidence"". The House of Commons said in a statement: ""The House takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously and provides a range of advice and support services which are available to members' staff."""

""I have never had television, either as a child or as an adult,"" he told MPs, and although it has a place it should not be the ""centre of family life"".""I have discovered a great game called Bananagram, which is brilliant for families, for those who enjoy that kind of thing,"" he said.He even joked that the cabinet could benefit from a few rounds of the game, which consists of a yellow banana-shaped bag of letter tiles, adding that it ""might be more productive than some of the conversations that are had"".The game, which shares features with Scrabble and other word games, was invented in 2007 and originally marketed as the ""anagram game that will drive you bananas!"". Mr Lefroy also stressed the importance of the wider community in providing a stable environment for children.The former accountant, who spent 11 years in Tanzania working in the coffee industry before becoming an MP, quoted an African proverb in Swahili, which he translated as ""it takes a whole village to raise a child"".Labour MP Margaret Greenwood, shadow spokesman for work and pensions, cautioned against putting too much emphasis on traditional families. saying there are ""many different types of family"".Commenting on the government's recent green paper Improving Lives, Helping Working Families. which stresses the impact parental relationship breakdown can have on children, she said: ""It does read like some sort of fairy tale that ignores the impact of government policies since 2010.""And the way it has made life so much harder for so many families, especially those on low incomes.""

2018-02-10,Government targets unpaid internships,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-42997400,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government has ramped up efforts to ""stamp out illegal unpaid internships"".HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has written to more than 500 firms over the last three months reminding them that interns classed as workers must be paid the minimum wage.The government also says it will ask HMRC to focus minimum wage enforcement work on firms using unpaid interns.  The details were contained in the government's response to a review of working practices. The Taylor Review into working practices, published last year, concentrated particularly on the so-called gig economy of part time and flexible workers.However, it also highlighted the issue of unpaid internships.It said the government should ensure that ""exploitative unpaid internships which damage social mobility in the UK, are stamped out"".In its response released earlier this week, the government said it accepted the recommendations of the review. ""Exploitative unpaid internships should not exist and we will work to eradicate these.""We will take action to improve the interpretation of the law and the enforcement action taken by HMRC in this area to help stamp out illegal unpaid internships,"" it added.According to the law, interns who are classed as workers must be paid at least the National Minimum Wage or the National Living Wage.A worker might be someone who has a contract or is subject to sanctions if they do not turn up for work.   Genuine volunteers on the other hand are not entitled to the minimum wage. The government said HMRC already contacted employers who had advertised for unpaid internships to ""ensure they are aware and compliant with the law"". However, a fresh crackdown took place in the last three months.It also said it would ""formally ask"" HMRC to focus activity in the coming year on firms which use unpaid interns, ""through intelligence-led enforcement"".""If this approach does not work, the government will review the existing policy and legal framework and will consider what other action can be taken"", it added.Last month the Sutton Trust charity estimated that 40% of 70,000 internships undertaken annually were unpaid - but said young workers need a minimum of £1,019 per month to live in London and £827 in Manchester.It backed cross-party calls to ban unpaid internships over a month long."
2018-02-10,MPs urge more housing help for elderly,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42997705,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOlder people should be given more help with housing to help them stay healthy and reduce the need for residential care, a committee of MPs has said.They called for the government to develop a new national strategy to deal with older people's housing needs.Proposals include funding for a handyman service, ""age proofing"" all new build homes and a national helpline to offer advice on housing options.The government said it had an ambitious plan to boost housing for everyone.According to the Commons communities and local government committee report, 18% of the population was 65 or older in 2016 and the number of people aged 85 and over was set to double to nearly 5% over the next 25 years.It said that being in an ""appropriate, comfortable and well-located home"" could have knock-on effects on people's health and independence.But while a ""sizeable minority"" of people would like to move in later life, the ""practical, financial and emotional aspects of moving home prevent or delay them from doing so"". The estimated direct cost of moving house in the UK is £8,451 the report said. Claudia Wood, of the think tank Demos, told the committee moving was an exhausting process, compounded by the fact that: ""People do not look for a retirement property when they are 60 and particularly capable of moving and quite happy to do so. They look at it when they are 75 or 80.""For the majority, who want to stay in their homes, more could be done to carry out small repairs and adapt properties to ensure the properties remain ""comfortable, healthy and safe"", the report said.  It recommended that the government's National Planning Policy Framework for England be amended to encourage more housing to be built specifically for older people. And it said there should be a new national strategy for older people - linked to the upcoming green paper on social care.All new homes should be ""age proofed"" so they are suitable for older people's needs, a telephone advice service should be set up and extra funding should be made available for home improvement agencies to operate handyman schemes for older people, MPs said.There should be a wider range of housing to suit people's needs and preferences, as evidence heard by MPs suggested a shortage of accessible and specialist housing and bungalows were being built.But the committee was not convinced of the need to have a stamp duty exemption for older people moving to smaller properties, arguing it would be difficult to implement and was not the ""main barrier"" to older people not wanting to move. Chairman Clive Betts said: ""With an ageing population, it's vital that the link between housing and health and social care is recognised.""The right kind of housing can help people stay healthy and support them to live independently. This can help reduce the need for home or residential care, bringing real benefits to the individual and also relieving pressure on the health service.""The Local Government Association welcomed the report and said there was a ""chronic shortage of homes suitable to support our ageing population"" - with housing for elderly people currently making up just 6% of councils' housing stock.A government spokesman said: ""We've set out an ambitious programme of reforms to boost housing supply for everyone - including elderly people.""We're also committed to helping older and disabled people live independently and safely and we're providing funding to help local housing authorities make a range of adaptations to a disabled or elderly person's home, such as installing ramps and stair lifts."""

In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."
2018-02-10,"Hey, big overspenders",https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42958465,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Northamptonshire County Council has said it is in financial trouble and is banning all new spending, raising questions about the financial health of local authorities across England. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""The BBC's analysis compares what councils estimated they would spend on services with what they actually spent.However some of the spending would have been off-set by government grants or savings.Selby District Council in Yorkshire said that despite government figures showing it spent £4.6m more on services than estimated at the start of the financial year, it finished 2016-17 with a £400,000 saving.The council said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term"" and had been given a ""clean bill of health"" by auditors.South Hams District Council in Devon said it would spend £31.5m on services in 2016-17 but reported spending £38m.The council said government grants covered most of the additional spending.However, it was still left with a £45,000 overspend, equivalent to 0.5% of the budget.From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."
2018-02-10,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42977661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: There are 21,000 fewer police officers.Reality Check verdict: That's about right - under the Conservative and coalition governments, the number of police officers has fallen by somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000.What's happening to policing and crime is a regular topic at Prime Minister's Questions, when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn goes head-to-head with Theresa May.Mr Corbyn asked: ""With crime rising, does the prime minister regret cutting 21,000 police officers?""Whether crime is rising or not is harder than you might imagine to determine. There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."
2018-02-10,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180210210430/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU  have now agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. Read more about the latest developments here.It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks have been trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. Agreement on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period and future relations between the UK and the EU. The UK aims to get the transition agreed in March, with a deal on permanent future relations agreed in the Autumn.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

Security, the devolution of powers, workers' rights and trade are to be covered.The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was a leading Leave supporter, said: ""What the public want is, they want the vision and they want some meat on the bones.""Her comments came as Tory rebel Anna Soubry warned Mrs May pro-European Conservatives could join forces with Labour to prevent the UK from leaving the single market and customs union.Asked if there was a Commons majority to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""If she's not careful, yes.""Asked if she thought Brexit will definitely happen, Ms Soubry, who was appearing alongside pro-Europe Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen.""Theresa May is set to make two key note addresses in the coming weeks, and arch Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox will also set out their agendas.Senior ministers are due to hold talks at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, and soon after that Mrs May is expected to set out her vision.The foreign secretary will begin the series of speeches on Wednesday and insiders say Boris Johnson will be seeking to unite Remainers and Leavers, the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said.Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will also be heard from, along with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who backed Remain in the referendum.But two prominent ministers who voted to remain - the chancellor and the home secretary - are not delivering speeches.No 10 said Philip Hammond spoke recently in Davos, while the prime minister herself will in effect cover Amber Rudd's brief when she gives a speech on security on Saturday.Mrs May will detail the ""security partnership"" the UK wants to maintain with the EU.Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions ministers who favoured a softer Brexit were being silenced.""He (Philip Hammond) is not part of the set of speeches that have been outlined today, but that doesn't mean that the Chancellor is not expressing his views both internally in the cabinet conversations, but also externally.""So I don't think there is anything in this, that this is somehow a kind of plot to gag a particular faction of ministers, I don't think that's a fair characterisation at all,"" he told ITV's Peston On Sunday.It comes after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 was ""not a given"".He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"".Penny Mordaunt hit back at Mr Barnier's comments, telling Andrew Marr: ""the other nations involved in this are very pragmatic and have not been impressed with some of the language that the (European) Commission has used"".Asked if it was a UK government ""red line"" to not have to grant full rights to EU migrants who come to Britain during a transition period, Ms Mordaunt said that was the government's position going into the next round of talks."

Penny Mordaunt will meet the charity on Monday to hear more about claims staff used prostitutes in Haiti in 2011.She said Oxfam had failed in its ""moral leadership"" over the ""scandal"".Meanwhile, Oxfam has announced new measures for the prevention and handling of sexual abuse cases.Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr she had written to other organisations funded by Department for International Development (DfID) urging them to report any safeguarding issues, past or present, and pledged they would all be followed up.Oxfam has faced growing criticism for the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated they country in 2010.The charity's own investigation into the allegations led to four people being sacked and three others resigning - among them its country director, Roland van Hauwermeiren.Ms Mordaunt said the allegations were ""a complete betrayal of both the people Oxfam were there to help and also the people that sent them there to do that job"".She said Oxfam did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting the detail of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"".She said she was considering whether Oxfam should receive any more funding from the government - which gave it £32m ($44m) in the last financial year.Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the reports in the Times newspaper had led to other staff coming forward with concerns about how employees were recruited and vetted. She said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.""If that review brings about a safer environment for all, then the publicity of the last few days, painful as it has been, will also have been valuable,"" she said. ""It is not sufficient to be appalled by the behaviour of our former staff - we must and will learn from it and use it as a spur to improvement.""The charity will also introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits and work with the rest of the aid sector to make it easier to share intelligence about people who have been found guilty of sexual misconduct.This will be in addition to measures designed to prevent sexual abuse and misconduct and improve the handling of allegations which Oxfam says it introduced in the wake of the Haiti case in 2011.Meanwhile, Oxfam is facing further allegations, reported in the Observer, that staff on its mission in Chad - also led by Mr van Hauwermeiren - used prostitutes in 2006.Oxfam said it could not corroborate the latest claims.The Sunday Times has also reported new allegations, saying more than 120 workers from UK charities were accused of sexual abuse in the past year.Ms Mordaunt's predecessor Priti Patel said she was aware of a wider issue of sexual abuse and child exploitation from when she was at DfID. She told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics there was ""a culture of denial in the aid sector about the exploitation and sexual abuse that has taken place historically for decades"" and called for a database for ""predatory paedophiles"" who she claimed could be infiltrating the organisations. Ms Mordaunt said she suspected there were paedophiles targeting the sector to carry out predatory activities, making it important that aid organisations reported offences.The allegations of misconduct by Oxfam staff in Haiti date from 2011 but came to light in a report in the Times on Friday, which said the charity's country director for Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, was alleged to have used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. Oxfam knew about the allegations at the time and launched an internal investigation, as a result of which four members of staff were dismissed. Three others, including Mr Van Hauwermeiren, were allowed to resign before the end of the investigation.Mr Van Hauwermeiren went on to work elsewhere in the sector, but Oxfam said it would not have provided a positive reference. The charity says it made a report public at the time which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti and issued a press release - but did not give details of the allegations.It told the Charity Commission it was investigating inappropriate sexual behaviour, bullying, harassment and staff intimidation but did again not reveal the exact details. The regulator took no further action at the time, but has since said it would have acted differently had it known all the facts.Oxfam has denied any cover-up. Its chief executive, Mark Goldring, told the BBC that describing details of the behaviour at the time could have drawn ""extreme attention"" to it, which he said would have been in no-one's best interest.Are you an aid worker?

2018-02-11,MPs could block May's Brexit - Soubry,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43023051,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPro-European Conservative MPs could join forces with Labour to block the kind of Brexit Theresa May wants, a Tory rebel has warned the PM.Anna Soubry claimed there would be a Commons majority against leaving the single market and customs union.Labour's Chuka Umunna, appearing alongside Ms Soubry on the Andrew Marr show, agreed with her comments.MPs have been promised a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit before it happens in March next year.""If this government doesn't get this right,"" said Ms Soubry, ""the majority of members of parliament, putting their constituents first, will find themselves unable to vote for a withdrawal agreement.""Theresa May is set to deliver a major speech within the next three weeks outlining the future relationship Britain wants to have with the EU.The prime minister has ruled out continued membership of the single market and customs union.But Ms Soubry, one of 11 pro-European Conservative MPs who defeated the government in December on the right to get a vote on any final Brexit deal, said the PM's stance was a ""huge mistake"".""Not only is it bad for our economy but it also fundamentally undermines the [Northern Ireland] peace process that was achieved and this is really important,"" she told Andrew Marr.She said she wanted the UK to remain in the European Free Trade Area, like Norway, which would allow access to the single market without being a member of the EU.Asked by Andrew Marr if they believed they had a majority in the House of Commons to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry said: ""If she's not careful, yes.""Mr Umunna said: ""There is no majority in the House of Commons for us simply to jump off a cliff.""When Andrew Marr suggested to Ms Soubry that she was politically closer to Mr Umunna than she was to leading Brexiteer and Conservative colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, she said: ""I'm not denying that.""Asked if she thought Brexit would definitely happen, Ms Soubry said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen.""Responding to whether it might be stopped, she said: ""Well I'll tell you who might stop it, and that's the people of this country.""We won't stop it. It is the people. We gave the people a referendum to start this process.""Mr Umunna said he also backed another referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal - something his party leader Jeremy Corbyn has appeared to rule out.He claimed the Labour leader - who last month rejected calls to attend a cross-party summit on avoiding a ""hard Brexit"" - was ""open minded"" about staying in the single market.""I cannot conceive of circumstances where Labour MPs are marshalled to go through the lobby and vote against us staying in the customs union and the single market, with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove,"" said Mr Umunna.Both MPs insisted they were acting in the ""national interest,"" which they said transcended party politics.Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said another Brexit referendum would cause divisions and a ""better route"" would be to have a general election.""Better we have a general election. On the issue, and all the other issues, because you then have a wider debate as well,"" he told told ITV's Peston On Sunday.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""It is good to see cross-party cooperation between Tory and Labour rebels.""He said he was ""optimistic that the rebellions in both Tory and Labour parties will spread in coming weeks"", and that his party was working with them in the House of Lords.

2018-02-11,Public ownership will cost nothing - Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43014861,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Labour's proposal to bring services such as water, energy and rail into public ownership would be ""cost free"", John McDonnell has said.The shadow chancellor says he wants to put public services ""irreversibly in the hands of workers"" so they can ""never again be taken away"".In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell said privatisation had failed. However, the Conservatives said his plan would cost taxpayers billions of pounds and lead to worse services.Earlier, Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme taking services into public ownership would not ultimately increase the burden on taxpayers because government bonds could be swapped for shares in a revenue-producing company.""It would be cost free. You borrow to buy an asset and when that asset is producing profits like the water industry does, that will cover your borrowing cost,"" he said.A report earlier this week by the Social Market Foundation, commissioned by a group of water companies, estimated that the up-front costs of renationalisation would be £90bn.But Mr McDonnell said utilities could be managed more efficiently under public ownership, because they would no longer have to fund dividends for shareholders.""They've given out £18bn of dividends to their shareholders - sometimes they've actually given out more in dividends than they've made in profits,"" he told the BBC.In his speech to Labour's Alternative Models of Ownership conference, Mr McDonnell said the best way to protect public services for the long term was for them to be owned by the public.He said: ""The next Labour government will put democratically owned and managed public services irreversibly in the hands of workers and of those who rely on their work.""Public services could be made more responsive and effective by bringing together the people who use them, workers and expert managers, the shadow chancellor said.He said: ""We aren't going to take back control of these industries in order to put them into the hands of a remote bureaucracy, but to put them into the hands of all of you - so that they can never again be taken away.""Public ownership is not just a political decision, it's an economic necessity.""We'll move away from the failed privatisation model of the past, developing new democratic forms of ownership, joining other countries, regions and cities across the world in taking control of our essential services.""by Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondentIt's not unusual for private companies in trouble to do a ""debt for equity swap"". To save the business, those investors who own shares (equity) lose everything, and those investors who own the company's less risky bonds (debt) get those shares.Swapping government debt for private company shares is unusual though. In theory, the Treasury could issue new government bonds - known as gilts - and hand them over to the private owners of water or electricity companies. That would then make taxpayers shareholders in the utility in question.But all the existing contracts would continue in force. So salaries and bonuses would have to be honoured, as would contracts with all other private sector suppliers. The new owners (taxpayers) would also need to retain experienced staff to do often very specialised work. If those skilled staff thought they'd earn more in the private sector, that may be an issue.Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss said: ""Labour would put politicians in charge of running everything from the phone lines to electricity supply, meaning people have nowhere to turn when things go wrong. That didn't work last time and won't work this time.""And UK business group the CBI said Labour's calls for nationalisation would ""wind the clock back on our economy"".Its managing director for people and infrastructure Neil Carberry said: ""If Labour turns its back on good collaboration between the government and the private sector, public services, infrastructure and taxpayers will ultimately pay the price.""In the speech, Mr McDonnell also announced the creation of a working group to look at how co-operatives can grow, expand and access funding, including the possibility of giving employees a greater right to own shares in the company they work for."

Nearly 700,000 people have left since the action began in August 2017. The BBC's Reeta Chakrabarti said there were smiles as the pair shook hands, but added: ""The plight of the Rohingya people will be a difficult topic.""Mr Johnson said: ""I spoke to her about my own experience witnessing the terrible conditions of the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, and my deep concern about their future.""I underlined the importance of the Burmese authorities carrying out a full and independent investigation into the violence in Rakhine, and to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations.""I underlined the urgency of creating the conditions in Rakhine that could make it a safe place for the Rohingya refugees to return to, free from fear, and in the knowledge that their basic rights will be respected and upheld.""He said the UK was ""already a major donor to the humanitarian crisis"" and would continue to use its global influence ""to find a way to provide a better future for the Rohingya community"". ""I encouraged her efforts to broker a nationwide peace settlement to put to an end 70 years of conflict in her homeland,"" he added.Myanmar's foreign ministry announced in a Facebook post alongside photos of  the pair meeting that they had ""discussed in an open and friendly manner the latest developments in Rakhine State, including planning for the reception of returnees who fled"". On Saturday, he met members of the Bangladeshi government and visited camps on the Bangladesh border holding the refugees. After visiting the Cox's Bazar camp, home to more than 500,000 refugees, Mr Johnson said the ""horrendous living conditions"" further strengthened his commitment to finding a solution.He said: ""It is vital that the Rohingya refugees must be allowed to their homes in Rakhine voluntarily, in safety and with dignity, under international oversight, and when the conditions... are right.""After meeting Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali, he said: ""I was really struck by how Bangladesh and the UK really share a common analysis of what needs to be done. We need to make those points together to the government in Nay Pyi Daw.""The United Nations has described the exodus of Rohingya people from Rakhine state, and the military offensive which provoked it, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".Neighbouring Bangladesh has agreed a timeframe with Myanmar for repatriating Rohingya people.But aid agencies have expressed concern over the projected figures for the transfer - Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week; Bangladesh says it aims to return everyone within two years.And the refugees are worried about the conditions and their rights upon their return. Britain is one of the biggest direct donors of aid for the humanitarian effort to help the refugees. The foreign secretary's trip to Bangladesh is the first such official visit in a decade. He will go on to Bangkok, Thailand, for talks with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha."
2018-02-11,Stormont deal could be unveiled in days,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43006235,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere is growing speculation that a deal to end the year-long political deadlock at Stormont could be unveiled as early as next week. Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Féin last January.  On Friday, both parties stayed away from scheduled round-table talks.Instead, British and Irish ministers met the three smaller parties - Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance.The politicians were told by Northern Ireland Office officials that the discussions involving the DUP and Sinn Féin are at ""a critical stage"".  It is understood that the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, has been meeting Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill and incoming party president Mary Lou McDonald elsewhere in Stormont's Parliament Buildings.The new Sinn Féin leadership is due to take over from Gerry Adams at the weekend, and some sources believe the parties might feel ready to move forward after that transition has been completed. Whilst the outline of an agreement is thought to be in place, neither of the two big parties have yet signed up. One informed source suggested that some DUP MPs have yet to be convinced.In a statement on Friday night, the DUP leader said ""progress has been made"" but added that there was ""more work to do"". ""I have set out the parameters for a deal. It must be fair and balanced,"" Mrs Foster added.""Our negotiating team will continue working next week. I want to see ministerial-led government restored to Northern Ireland. ""I hope that can be achieved by devolved government and will work towards that end.""On his last night as leader of Sinn Féin, the outgoing party president Gerry Adams said: ""It isn't sorted out as we speak. ""We have made some progress but there are still considerable obstacles but as I said to our unionist friends, this is the last chance agreement.""Both the DUP and Sinn Féin have previously said that the talks process cannot continue indefinitely.The smaller parties expressed their frustration at the fact that not all the five parties attended Friday's talks.The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, told the two governments: ""You've got my number, give me a call when something is happening.""In a later statement, he said: ""The truth is, this isn't an all-party process. It is an exclusive two-party process.""The SDLP are not here to window dress but we want to be constructive. I've told both governments when the two-party process is concluded and they are ready to engage in five-party negotiations the SDLP will be ready to negotiate.""Meanwhile, an Ulster Unionist source said the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, told them: ""I feel your frustration"". It is understood the UUP leader, Robin Swann, replied: ""I am not here for a counselling session. I am here to get a government up and running"".Earlier, it emerged that the prime minister has been considering flying over to Belfast next week if that will help the talks.Last month, the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said both he and Theresa May were happy to get engaged personally, if they thought it would make a difference. The details of any potential deal remain unclear. It is thought the parties have been examining how to resolve their differences over Irish language legislation. Previously, the Alliance party has suggested that a package of separate bills dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and other languages might break the impasse.DUP negotiators are understood to be keen to ensure there should be no repeat of last year's breakdown of devolution. They have suggested that some way to make the Stormont institutions more sustainable should be introduced.There has also been discussion of changes to the operation of the assembly's controversial ""petition of concern"" system, which was designed to safeguard minorities but has been used to block a number of measures.Earlier this week, the government rejected a suggestion from Labour that the issue of same sex marriage should be taken off the talks agenda and dealt with directly via Westminster legislation. However, some sources suggest the idea could be altered so that Westminster might take over the issue if the assembly can not deal with it within a set period of time.  "
2018-02-11,Abuse of politicians 'getting worse',https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43022850,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo Welsh MPs have said abuse against politicians has ""definitely got worse"", both online and in person. David Davies, Conservative MP for Monmouth and Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, said they had received ""threatening"" personal abuse. It comes after a cross party committee called for a new code of conduct for MPs, Peers and workers in parliament. They said members of the public were launching personal attacks rather than debating them on politics. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement, Mr Davies said abuse against politicians was on the rise. ""It's definitely getting worse,"" he said. ""I noticed at the last election there was a level of unpleasantness I haven't seen before.""I was involved in a row this week which is on YouTube and people said I was aggressive but I'm not going to sit and take a load of rubbish. ""The first thing you see on the video is a protestor saying to me 'you are the worst piece of scum I've ever met'. If I went up to somebody in the street and said 'you are the worst piece of scum' I would expect a fairly robust response. ""People think because he's an MP they can do that and get away with it...we shouldn't have to put up with stuff that nobody else would put up with.""Ms Harris, also on the programme, said much of the abuse came from social media. She said was particularly targeted after the death of her eight-year-old son in 1989, but also after shadow home secretary Dianne Abbott wished her husband a happy birthday earlier this year. ""I've had it online and I've had in in person. I find people who have got nothing valuable to say or haven't got a good argument will just turn it into aggression to try and make a point. ""I think social media's played a big part in it. Keyboard warriors are now a lot braver because they have avenue to channel their hate."""

""Yet at the same time they dismissed the UK's push for reasonable safeguards to ensure our interests are protected. It is not possible to have it both ways.""Mr Davis says businesses need ""about two years"" with much the same trading rules as they have now to allow them to adjust after the UK leaves the EU on 29 March next year.And he had hoped to get a deal with the EU on it by this March, so talks could then move on to the bigger issue of the UK's future relationship with the remaining 27 EU nations.But Mr Barnier, speaking after a week of technical discussions between civil servants on both sides, said that three ""substantial"" disagreements remained over the transition period. The pound fell sharply against the dollar and the euro during Mr Barnier's speech before recovering slightly to stand about 0.7% down on the day.""To be frank, I am surprised by these disagreements. The positions of the EU are very logical, I think,"" said Mr Barnier.He said the UK must ""accept the ineluctable consequences of its decision to leave the EU, to leave its institutions and its policies"".""If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given.""By BBC Political Correspondent Leila NathooThis was a politely delivered but pointed message to Britain: you can't keep up your cake-and-eat-it approach of vowing to leave the single market and customs union while still wanting no checks at the Irish border. And don't bank on a transition period (which was supposed to be the easy bit to agree) as there's still plenty we don't see eye-to-eye on. Theresa May has been keeping the government's position deliberately vague as her ministers struggle to agree among themselves on exactly how they see Britain's future ties with the EU. But the bottom line from Brussels today? Time to talk straight and put flesh on the bones.Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister should should take immediate action to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" for business.""Theresa May must end the infighting within her cabinet, drop her reckless redlines and accept Labour's proposals for a transitional deal. ""That means seeking to remain in a customs union with the EU and within the single market during that period."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who wants a referendum on any final deal with the EU, said the government ""has no plan, no strategy, and no idea"".But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which supports Theresa May's minority government, accused Mr Barnier of ""brandishing the threat of customs controls"" when ""everyone has committed to avoiding a hard border"". They argued that the best solution was to resolve the issue through a free trade agreement and ""fresh customs partnership with Brussels"".Mr Barnier hit back at comments by David Davis, who described a leaked EU document suggesting any dispute with the UK during the transition period could mean UK benefits, such as access to the single market, being suspended as ""frankly discourteous"".The EU negotiator said he had ""not been in the least discourteous or vindictive"" adding: ""Quite simply we have to construct a withdrawal agreement which is legally sound and does not give rise to any uncertainty in anyone's mind.""On the thorny issue of the border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland, Mr Barnier said there was agreement that a hard border must be avoided, but added: ""It is important to tell the truth. ""A UK decision to leave the single market and to leave the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.""Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK will leave the single market and the customs union, although she has yet to spell out in detail what she wants instead. She secured an agreement on withdrawal - including avoiding the return of a hard Irish border - in December.But that has now got to be translated into a legal text before it can be ratified by the EU - and Mr Barnier said he wanted to get rid of any ambiguity on the Irish border question.The withdrawal agreement includes a fall back position if the UK leaves without a deal, which proposes ""full regulatory alignment"" with the EU.To some this sounds like staying in the single market and customs union - but other options, preferred by the UK, to avoid border checks are still on the table.Mr Barnier said the UK has accepted the need to discus how to make ""full regulatory alignment"" work in practice, while the other options are discussed in parallel.But he added: ""Time is short - very short - and we haven't a minute to lose if we want to succeed. And we do want to succeed in this orderly withdrawal."""

Proposals accepted by the government include mandatory training for MPs who have bullied or harassed employees.But some are concerned the grievance procedure focuses too much on the parliamentary estate. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom insisted constituency offices would be covered by the new behaviour code.A cross-party committee set up in response to widespread allegations of sexual harassment has recommended a range of sanctions, which MPs will be asked to approve by the end of February.One aide to a Labour MP told the BBC: ""I spend most of my time in the constituency office, along with the rest of my boss's staff. We feel quite left out of the whole situation.""He said he had seen ""intimidation and poor treatment"" in three different constituency offices, where staff interaction ""is often one-on-one and unseen"".Andrea Leadsom, who will oversee implementation of the new procedure, emphasised it would be able to meet these concerns.One key measure recommended by the committee is a code of conduct for all who work in or for Parliament, covering ""behaviours that contribute to bullying and harassment and sexual harassment"".But Mrs Leadsom acknowledged ""the main focus of the problem we're seeking to solve is on the parliamentary estate"". The committee's report contains the admission that it had ""not taken sufficient evidence and advice"" regarding constituencies and should be ""an area for early future action"".Staff were also concerned that the proposals do not change the terms of employment of staff, who will still be directly employed by MPs, who, in effect, operate as small-business owners.One member of staff said that ""unless there's a better solution to the directly-employed-by-member system I don't think these sticking plasters can fix the culture"".Andrea Leadsom stressed the independence of the proposed sexual violence adviser who would be able to decide on appropriate action. However, the BBC was also told of problems with the existing independent investigations procedure for employees of the Houses of Parliament, as opposed to those working for MPs or parties.The BBC understands it has only been used a handful of times and ""does not inspire confidence"". The House of Commons said in a statement: ""The House takes the welfare of everyone who works in Parliament very seriously and provides a range of advice and support services which are available to members' staff."""

In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."
2018-02-11,"Hey, big overspenders",https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42958465,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Northamptonshire County Council has said it is in financial trouble and is banning all new spending, raising questions about the financial health of local authorities across England. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""The BBC's analysis compares what councils estimated they would spend on services with what they actually spent.However some of the spending would have been off-set by government grants or savings.Selby District Council in Yorkshire said that despite government figures showing it spent £4.6m more on services than estimated at the start of the financial year, it finished 2016-17 with a £400,000 saving.The council said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term"" and had been given a ""clean bill of health"" by auditors.South Hams District Council in Devon said it would spend £31.5m on services in 2016-17 but reported spending £38m.The council said government grants covered most of the additional spending.However, it was still left with a £45,000 overspend, equivalent to 0.5% of the budget.From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."
2018-02-11,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42977661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: There are 21,000 fewer police officers.Reality Check verdict: That's about right - under the Conservative and coalition governments, the number of police officers has fallen by somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000.What's happening to policing and crime is a regular topic at Prime Minister's Questions, when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn goes head-to-head with Theresa May.Mr Corbyn asked: ""With crime rising, does the prime minister regret cutting 21,000 police officers?""Whether crime is rising or not is harder than you might imagine to determine. There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so.Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today.I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one.In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter?The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win.But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different.As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room?That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say."
2018-02-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-11,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180211202556/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said the talks had reached ""a decisive phase"".Mrs May said that ""it was now at the point where it's time for local elected representatives to find a way to work together"".She said she had ""full and frank conversations with the main parties"" and that while ""some differences remain, I believe it is possible to see the basis of an agreement here"".Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he was hopeful that the two parties could ""come to an agreement this week"".""The soundings from Arlene Foster and Mary Lou McDonald were positive,"" he added.Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed in January last year. The then deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, pulled Sinn Féin out of the coalition after a series of disagreements with the final straw being the DUP's handling of a scandal over green energy scheme.Mrs Foster said her party wanted a deal that was ""sustainable into the future"".Ms McDonald said:  ""What is required now is the political will to make it happen.""SDLP leader Colum Eastwood called on the DUP and Sinn Féin to ""stop messing about"".""We still don't know the colour of this deal,"" he said.Prior to arriving at Stormont, Mrs May visited Bombardier's plant in Belfast.She met factory floor workers and was shown the capabilities of the multi-million pound plant which is the main production site for wings for the C-Series.Her visit came just over two weeks after Bombardier's victory in a trade dispute with rival aerospace firm Boeing.The US International Trade Commission (ITC) overturned a decision to impose damaging tariffs on US imports of its C-Series aircraft, which would have placed jobs in the Belfast factory at risk. Several previous rounds of talks between the DUP and Sinn Féin have, so far, failed to break the political deadlock.Earlier, a DUP source told the BBC a deal ""is not likely"" on Monday.Mrs May last visited Northern Ireland in May when she toured the Balmoral Show ahead of a snap general election. Since then, she has struck a parliamentary deal with the DUP and has faced criticism for adopting a hands-off approach to the deadlock at Stormont. Among the issues that have divided the parties is Sinn Féin's demand for an Irish language act.By BBC News NI political correspondent Mark DevenportThe Irish language act has been a major stumbling block, with DUP leader Arlene Foster promising previously that it wouldn't happen on her watch.What I am led to believe is that there could possibly be a very strange, legislative fudge which would see the creation of three separate bills, one for the Irish language, one dealing with Ulster Scots and one for wider cultural issues. The suggestion is that these three bills would end up merging together as one act in an attempt to spare blushes on all sides.On marriage equality, I am not exactly sure how they are going to sort that one out, but one option that has been discussed is the possibility of bringing a private member's bill on the issue or deferring responsibility to Westminster.At least three or four DUP MLAs would be pretty hostile to the notion, but equally there are some who would support it, or at least not objectA Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister would remind the parties of the many pressing issues facing Northern Ireland and make clear her belief that a fully functioning executive is the best way to serve the interests of the whole community.""The (Irish) government has consistently said that the restoration of the institutions is essential in the context of full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and that it will continue to work very closely with the British government to support the northern parties to achieve this outcome,"" he said.At the weekend, Sinn Féin's vice president Michelle O'Neill predicted that the Stormont talks would conclude this week.Her comment strengthened speculation that a compromise between her party and the DUP could soon be unveiled."

""Ministers are not allowed to take shared parental leave.""He added: ""The reality is I've discussed with my wife about whether she'd like to take shared parental leave, even if it was available to me - each family has to make the decision that suits them.""Quizzed on the rules affecting ministers, he promised to ""take it away and think about it"".Shared parental leave explainedAs ""office holders"" rather than employees, usual rules of parental leave do not apply to MPs, the House of Commons said, with arrangements made privately between members and their parties. It said specific arrangements affecting ministers would be the responsibility of the Cabinet Office.Several ministers have taken maternity leave - Labour's Yvette Cooper became the first to do so in 2001.MPs recently voted in favour of allowing members who have a baby to vote by proxy, with Parliament's procedure committee now considering how that could work in practice."

In a letter to UKIP supporters, Mr Oakden said he had intended to step down last autumn after the party's annual conference but had agreed to stay on for a short time at Mr Bolton's request after his election.While now was the ""right time"" to go, he insisted it had nothing to do with next Saturday's vote, insisting that he was required to remain ""impartial"" in the leadership process and would continue to serve the party. ""I have made this decision irrespective of the outcome of the EGM and I'm announcing it now to ensure that it remains absolutely unconnected to whatever democratic decision the membership may take on Saturday,"" he said.Mr Bolton, UKIP's fourth party leader in about 18 months, has suggested he will overhaul the NEC if he wins Saturday's vote, as part of efforts to professionalise the party.

2018-02-12,Oxfam deputy quits over Haiti sex claims,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43027631,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOxfam's deputy chief executive has resigned over the handling of a sex scandal involving aid workers.The British charity is accused of concealing the findings of an inquiry into claims staff used prostitutes while delivering aid in Haiti in 2011.Penny Lawrence said she was ""ashamed"" and takes full responsibility.The Charity Commission has launched a statutory inquiry into Oxfam - which denies a cover-up - but details of its scope have not yet been released.The watchdog says it has concerns the charity may not have ""fully and frankly"" disclosed everything it knew about the claims despite previous assurances from Oxfam.Michelle Russell, director of investigations at the commission, said if details had been known it would have dealt with the situation ""very differently"".It comes after an earlier meeting with the International Development Secretary in an effort to protect Oxfam's funding from being cut.Ms Lawrence joined Oxfam GB in 2006 as international programmes director, leading teams across 60 countries, according to the charity's website. ""Concerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon,"" she said in a statement. ""It is now clear that these allegations - involving the use of prostitutes and which related to the behaviour of both the country director and members of his team in Chad - were raised before he moved to Haiti.""The allegations emerged in The Times on Friday, which said Oxfam's country director for Haiti, Roland van Hauwermeiren, used prostitutes at a villa rented for him by Oxfam in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. According to the paper, Oxfam knew about concerns over the conduct of Mr van Hauwermeiren and another man when they worked in Chad before they were given senior roles in Haiti.Oxfam said allegations that underage girls may have been involved were unproven.Widza Bryant, who worked in HR for Oxfam in Haiti from 2009 for three years, said she shared ""ongoing rumours"" about locals being exploited with her boss ""on many occasions"".She told BBC News: ""There were a lot of rumours on the ground about management and leaders exploiting the locals sexually and in other ways to get jobs and to have good standing.""Mark Goldring, chief executive of Oxfam GB, admitted the charity had failed to act on complaints highlighting the failure to allow Mr van Hauwermeiren to move onto another post after allegations were revealed.He said the use of prostitutes was ""not explicitly contrary"" to Oxfam's code of conduct at the time, but bringing Oxfam into disrepute in any way and abusing people who may have been beneficiaries was.Mr Goldring added: ""There was an exploration of how should the organisation respond but we didn't act on it.""The European Commission has said it expects full clarity and maximum transparency from Oxfam, adding that it is ready to ""cease funding any partner not living up to high ethical standards"".The charity's programme in Haiti received €1.7m in EU funds in 2011. International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said Oxfam had apologised for its ""appalling"" behaviour and that the government had not been told at the time the allegations involved sexual misconduct or beneficiaries.Oxfam has been told to tell the Department for International Development by the end of the week how it will handle any future allegations around safeguarding or it faces losing government funding.Ms Mordaunt also called for clearer whistle-blowing policies across the charitable sector and launched an urgent review into safeguarding and aid providers.The Innocent drinks company - one of Oxfam's corporate sponsors which donates around £100,000 per year- said it wants to see a clear plan ""for how this could not ever happen again"".The charity has since postponed a ""Fashion Fighting Poverty"" event, which had been due to take place as part of London Fashion Week on Thursday, saying it was not the ""right time"" at present.Oxfam's own investigation in 2011 led to four people being sacked and three others resigning, including Mr van Hauwermeiren.It produced a public report, which said ""serious misconduct"" had taken place in Haiti - but did not give details of the allegations.Oxfam has faced growing criticism of the way it handled the allegations of misconduct by its staff in Haiti, where they were working in the aftermath of the huge earthquake that devastated the country in 2010.Haiti's ambassador in London Bocchit Edmond called the revelations ""shocking"", ""shameful"", and ""unacceptable"".On Sunday, Ms Mordaunt told the BBC's Andrew Marr the charity did ""absolutely the wrong thing"" by not reporting details of the allegations and that no organisation could be a government partner if it did not ""have the moral leadership to do the right thing"".Ahead of the government meeting, Oxfam announced new measures for handling of sexual abuse cases, saying it would introduce tougher vetting of staff and mandatory safeguarding training for new recruits.Oxfam's chairman of trustees, Caroline Thomson, said the charity's board had appointed a consultant earlier this year to review its culture and working practices, which would now be extended.Are you an aid worker?

In a post on Twitter, he said he wanted to concentrate on his constituency and his role as Westminster leader. So far only Glasgow MSP James Dornan has announced he will be standing for the post but it is thought a number of MPs will consider standing against him. Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman, Edinburgh MP Tommy Sheppard, Livingston MP Hannah Bardell, and Perth MP Pete Wishart are among those who may throw their hats into the ring. It is thought that front benchers Dr Philippa Whiteford and Joanna Cherry may also join the contest. Angus Robertson stood down as deputy leader earlier this month, eight months after losing his Westminster seat. Mr Blackford announced that he would not be replacing Mr Robertson in an interview with The Press and Journal. He said it was an ""absolute privilege"" to be a Highland MP. And he added: ""I take quite seriously the responsibilities I've got as leader in Westminster and supporting the government in Holyrood.""If I was depute leader as well, something would have to give. I think it is maybe simply too much to ask.""I have chosen not to allow my name to go forward for nomination for SNP depute leader to concentrate on my role as a Highland MP and SNP Westminster leader. I look forward to working with the new depute leader.  https://t.co/CaXuxcueKrEnd of Twitter post  by @IanBlackfordMP"
2018-02-12,Inquiry into Stagecoach East Coast deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43022843,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe decision to end the East Coast Mainline rail franchise early is to come under scrutiny from MPs.The Department for Transport has said Stagecoach and Virgin will withdraw from running the service within months after running into difficulties.Now the House of Commons transport committee has announced that it will hold an inquiry into the matter.Rail Minister Jo Johnson acknowledged the companies overbid for the right to run the service.He told the BBC's Today programme: ""They overbid, it's very simple and the department is  looking very carefully into the bidding process to ensure there aren't any incentives for bidders to overbid.""However, he said it was not possible to remove the element of risk entirely: ""With any private enterprise there is an element of risk. It is unrealistic to expect government to eliminate that altogether.""Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the transport committee, said: ""There are serious questions to be asked of the train operator, Network Rail and ministers and the transport committee intends to ask them. ""The failure of the East Coast franchise has wider implications for rail franchising and the competitiveness of the current system. Lessons need to be learned by all concerned.""In the meantime, the Department for Transport must take the right steps to protect passengers and taxpayers. Safeguards must be put in place to restore public confidence in the sustainability of our railways.""The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express.It was re-privatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government £3.3bn to run the service.Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%.Last week, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach had ""got its numbers wrong"" and would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"".He said the government might step in to run the service, adding that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected.The National Audit Office has already announced it will investigate the government's handling of the franchise.A Stagecoach Group spokesman said: ""Virgin Trains East Coast is a well-run, profitable railway and we are continuing to meet our contractual commitments, as we have done throughout the past 21 years in operating train services on behalf of the government.""He added that customer satisfaction with the route was high and that it was ""delivering 30% higher payments to the taxpayer than when the route was in public ownership"". And Mr Johnson told the BBC that passenger journeys had doubled since the line had been run as a franchise in the 1990s. Mr Grayling has said he is considering two approaches.One option is to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort."
2018-02-12,Views invited on larger Welsh Assembly,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43033143,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPeople are being asked to share their view on plans to expand the Welsh Assembly by an extra 20 to 30 members.An expert panel said the move was necessary to cope with the growing workload as more power is devolved.Also, the vote would be given to 16 and 17-year-olds as part of proposals to reform the 60-member assembly.Presiding Officer Elin Jones hailed ""the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests"".The assembly is already due to be renamed the Welsh Parliament as a result of a previous consultation. Powers for the assembly to change its electoral rules, size and other internal affairs are being granted under the 2017 Wales Act.Last week, AMs voted in favour of putting the expert panel's recommendations out to public consultation.Ms Jones said: ""The Wales Act 2017 marks the start of a new phase of devolution in Wales, giving us the opportunity to make profound changes to our legislature. ""We now have the opportunity to forge the national parliament that the people of Wales deserve to champion their interests."" The panel, chaired by Prof Laura McAllister of Cardiff University, also recommended a change in the voting system, to a proportional method called the Single Transferable Vote.One option would be to pair the current 40 constituencies to merge them into 20 seats, each with four AMs, giving a total of 80.A gender quota would boost the number of women in the Senedd, and the option of standing as a ""job share"" candidate would aim to encourage people with disabilities or caring responsibilities.Any changes will require a law to be passed in the assembly with a two-thirds majority.When the report was published in December, Welsh Labour said it would not give its view until its 2019 conference, which Plaid Cymru AM Simon Thomas said ""kills dead"" any chance of reform before the next election in 2021.The consultation is open until 6 April.In January, the Welsh Government proposed votes for 16 and 17-year-olds in council elections as part of a package of local government reforms."

But one Conservative MP hit out at the ""lazy assumption"" that ""straight white men"" cannot fight for equality.The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it had received a complaint about the matter and ""as with all complaints we receive, will be assessing the details before determining whether any action is needed"".Now there is fresh controversy after Young Labour started selling tickets for a one-day national equalities conference but said it would restrict access to those who met defined criteria. A Labour spokesman said there was ""nothing new about spaces for people with protected characteristics meeting to discuss the inequalities and obstacles they face"".""The purpose of this conference is to ensure that members from disadvantaged groups are able to elect representatives to Young Labour's National Committee. All other positions on the committee are elected online, via a 'one member one vote' system.""In past years, Young Labour has selected all their committee members at an annual event, using caucuses to choose individual women's, disabled, LGBT+ and BAME representatives. The party is moving to a new system of online voting for most positions on its national committee, including its chair, its representatives from the English regions, Scotland and Wales as well as its representative on Labour's National Executive Committee.It is understood it cannot yet do this for the equalities representatives as it does not hold relevant information on the identities of members who would be eligible to vote and that is why the event is taking place. Conservative MPs have taken to social media suggesting the exclusion of certain groups was a form of discrimination in itself.

Security, the devolution of powers, workers' rights and trade are to be covered.The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was a leading Leave supporter, said: ""What the public want is, they want the vision and they want some meat on the bones.""Her comments came as Tory rebel Anna Soubry warned Mrs May pro-European Conservatives could join forces with Labour to prevent the UK from leaving the single market and customs union.Asked if there was a Commons majority to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""If she's not careful, yes.""Asked if she thought Brexit will definitely happen, Ms Soubry, who was appearing alongside pro-Europe Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen.""Theresa May is set to make two key note addresses in the coming weeks, and arch Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox will also set out their agendas.Senior ministers are due to hold talks at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, and soon after that Mrs May is expected to set out her vision.The foreign secretary will begin the series of speeches on Wednesday and insiders say Boris Johnson will be seeking to unite Remainers and Leavers, the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said.Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will also be heard from, along with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who backed Remain in the referendum.But two prominent ministers who voted to remain - the chancellor and the home secretary - are not delivering speeches.No 10 said Philip Hammond spoke recently in Davos, while the prime minister herself will in effect cover Amber Rudd's brief when she gives a speech on security on Saturday.Mrs May will detail the ""security partnership"" the UK wants to maintain with the EU.Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions ministers who favoured a softer Brexit were being silenced.""He (Philip Hammond) is not part of the set of speeches that have been outlined today, but that doesn't mean that the Chancellor is not expressing his views both internally in the cabinet conversations, but also externally.""So I don't think there is anything in this, that this is somehow a kind of plot to gag a particular faction of ministers, I don't think that's a fair characterisation at all,"" he told ITV's Peston On Sunday.It comes after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned that a transition period immediately after Brexit in 2019 was ""not a given"".He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"".Penny Mordaunt hit back at Mr Barnier's comments, telling Andrew Marr: ""the other nations involved in this are very pragmatic and have not been impressed with some of the language that the (European) Commission has used"".Asked if it was a UK government ""red line"" to not have to grant full rights to EU migrants who come to Britain during a transition period, Ms Mordaunt said that was the government's position going into the next round of talks."
2018-02-12,Digital cash hack hits government websites,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43025788,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) took down its website after a warning that hackers were taking control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency.Security researcher Scott Helme said more than 4,000 websites, including many government ones, were affected.He said the affected code had now been disabled and visitors were no longer at risk.The ICO said: ""We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it.""Mr Helme said he was alerted by a friend who had received a malware warning when he visited the ICO website.He traced the problem to a website plug-in called Browsealoud, used to help blind and partially sighted people access the web.Texthelp, the company which makes the plug-in, confirmed that the product was affected for four hours by malicious code designed to generate cryptocurrency.The cryptocurrency involved was Monero - a rival to Bitcoin that is designed to make transactions in it ""untraceable"" back to the senders and recipients involved.The plug-in had been tampered with to add a program, Coinhive, which ""mines"" for Monero by running processor-intensive calculations on visitors' computers.Once the plug-in was infected, it affected thousands of other websites in addition to the ICO's, which used it.By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondentThe surge in value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hasn't escaped the attention of hackers looking to make a quick buck. Mining, the process where new digital coins are created by solving complex mathematical problems, uses increasing amounts of computer processing power and that means big electricity bills. All the better then if you can get other people's computers to do the job. The hackers do this by inserting software into websites which then means that, unbeknown to them, visitors' computers are put to work mining cryptocurrencies. It seems that the Information Commissioner's site along with others run by the government were infected by crypto-mining code injected into some accessibility software they all use. This kind of attack is becoming increasingly common and while it appears not to cause data loss or damage to systems, it does mean computers can run much more slowly.Mr Helme said: ""It's a very lucrative proposal. They infect one website and it infects close to 5,000.""This was a very serious breach. They could have extracted personal data, stolen information or installed malware. It was only limited by the hackers' imaginations.""As well as the ICO website, the hacked script was found running on the site of the Student Loans Company, Barnsley Hospital and other websites in the UK and worldwide.Martin McKay, chief technical officer of TextHelp, said: ""In light of other recent cyber-attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year and our data security action plan was actioned straight away.""The company is commissioning a security review by an independent consultancy following the attack, he said.Because the malware only runs while someone is actively visiting an infected site, there is no further risk to users' computers, Mr Helme added.A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said: ""NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency.""The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely.""At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk."""

It is the people. We gave the people a referendum to start this process.""Mr Umunna said he also backed another referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal - something his party leader Jeremy Corbyn has appeared to rule out.He claimed the Labour leader - who last month rejected calls to attend a cross-party summit on avoiding a ""hard Brexit"" - was ""open minded"" about staying in the single market.""I cannot conceive of circumstances where Labour MPs are marshalled to go through the lobby and vote against us staying in the customs union and the single market, with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove,"" said Mr Umunna.Both MPs insisted they were acting in the ""national interest,"" which they said transcended party politics.Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said another Brexit referendum would cause divisions and a ""better route"" would be to have a general election.""Better we have a general election. On the issue, and all the other issues, because you then have a wider debate as well,"" he told told ITV's Peston On Sunday.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""It is good to see cross-party cooperation between Tory and Labour rebels.""He said he was ""optimistic that the rebellions in both Tory and Labour parties will spread in coming weeks"", and that his party was working with them in the House of Lords.

International aid summits since the 1970s have been urging countries to spend 0.7% of their national income on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid.The UK government first did so in 2013, and approved legislation requiring it to do so in 2015. In 2016, that translated to a total spend of £13.4bn, according to the Department for International Development.Some of that money went to charities. Oxfam received £31.7m from the UK government, which is about a quarter of a percent of what the government spends on foreign aid each year.But it is a sizeable chunk of Oxfam's funding. The charity had a total income of £409m last year, of which £176m came from government and other public authorities. Of the rest, £108m came from donations and legacies and £91m from sales in its shops.Its total income put it at number four on the list of UK charities, behind Cancer Research, the British Heart Foundation and Macmillan Cancer Support, according to the 2017 Top 100 Charities Fundraising Spotlight.About 64% of UK foreign aid is bilateral aid, which is sent directly to the countries involved. Last year, the top three recipients were Pakistan, Syria and Ethiopia.The remaining 36% is multilateral aid, which is distributed by international organisations including charities.The top recipient of UK multilateral aid is the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. It received £1.1bn from the UK last year.The second item in the graph above was the part of the UK's contribution to the EU budget that may be counted as development aid.The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future.Oxfam's £31.7m puts it just outside the top 20 recipients of multilateral aid.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-12,Your questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-43003430,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe news that nearly all local authorities in England plan to raise council tax prompted some questions from our readers. Here are the answers to the things you wanted to know.Samuel Jones, 25, from Huddersfield asked: ""Is there any way we, the people, can fight this? If a utility bill goes up I can simply leave that company, here do I have no choice but to pay?""Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said councils were allowed to raise tax by 3% this year. Larger authorities which fund social care can increase it up to 5.99%.You cannot appeal your bill simply because you think it is too expensive, according to the Valuation Office Agency.But under certain circumstances, such as believing you are in the wrong council tax band, an appeal is possible.All adults must pay council tax unless they are a full time student or meet other exemption criteria.If you don't pay, your local authority can ask magistrates to issue a liability order.This would allow the council to take money from your wages or benefits, or instruct bailiffs to remove goods to cover the arrears.This question came from David Taylor, 71, from Surrey.In 2016-17 councils and other bodies across England paid £7.4bn in pension contributions, although it's uncertain exactly how much of that was funded by council tax.During that period, people in England paid £26bn in council tax, which accounted for 28% of total local government funding.If 28% of local authority pension contributions that year came from council tax, then the cost would be about £2bn.That amounts to 8p of every £1 of council tax paid in England.Councils use any money made by recycling to offset the cost of bin collections according to Lee Marshall, chief executive of the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee.""It will depend on the contract with the other companies in the chain as to if the council gets any money back and how much it is,"" he said. ""If they do receive any money, it goes back into the council budget and they usually put it towards the cost of bin collections,"" he said.""Councils don't make lots of money out of recycling, it just means it's slightly less expensive to collect the waste in the first place.""""Core central government funding to councils will be further reduced by half over the next two years,"" said a spokesman for the Local Government Association.This funding will be almost phased out completely by the end of the decade, he said.""Councils also face an unprecedented surge in demand for children's services and homelessness support,"" he said. ""This is leaving increasingly less money for councils to fund other services, like fixing potholes, cleaning streets and running leisure centres and libraries. ""As a result councils in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed £5bn by 2020.""The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has said its finance settlement ""strikes a balance"" between relieving pressure on councils and ensuring taxpayers ""do not face excessive bills"".A spokesman previously told the BBC councils would see a ""real-term increase in resources over the next two years"".He added that more control had also been given to councils over the business rates they raise locally so ""millions of pounds"" could stay in communities."
2018-02-12,Slow progress?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42989884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAnother gathering in Downing Street has come and gone, imagined at one point to be a ""crunch meeting"" at which Cabinet colleagues might thrash out their differences on the destination of Brexit. In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."
2018-02-12,"Hey, big overspenders",https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42958465,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Northamptonshire County Council has said it is in financial trouble and is banning all new spending, raising questions about the financial health of local authorities across England. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""The BBC's analysis compares what councils estimated they would spend on services with what they actually spent.However some of the spending would have been off-set by government grants or savings.Selby District Council in Yorkshire said that despite government figures showing it spent £4.6m more on services than estimated at the start of the financial year, it finished 2016-17 with a £400,000 saving.The council said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term"" and had been given a ""clean bill of health"" by auditors.South Hams District Council in Devon said it would spend £31.5m on services in 2016-17 but reported spending £38m.The council said government grants covered most of the additional spending.However, it was still left with a £45,000 overspend, equivalent to 0.5% of the budget.From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."
2018-02-12,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42977661,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: There are 21,000 fewer police officers.Reality Check verdict: That's about right - under the Conservative and coalition governments, the number of police officers has fallen by somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000.What's happening to policing and crime is a regular topic at Prime Minister's Questions, when Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn goes head-to-head with Theresa May.Mr Corbyn asked: ""With crime rising, does the prime minister regret cutting 21,000 police officers?""Whether crime is rising or not is harder than you might imagine to determine. There's good evidence that certain types of violent crimes are rising but the overall amount of crime people report experiencing is falling. As of September 2017, there were 121,929 police officers in England and Wales, the lowest number in at least 20 years - policing in Scotland and Northern Ireland is a devolved issue.The latest figures show that between September 2010 and September 2017, the number of police officers in English and Welsh forces fell by 19,921 or 14%, according to the Home Office.Since September 2009 - the last set of figures before the Conservatives came into government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats - there's been a cut of 22,424 police officers.Numbers of police community support officers (PCSOs), who patrol the streets, have fallen by almost 40% during this period.As of March 2017, there were 6,278 authorised firearms officers in England and Wales, down from 6,976 in March 2010.The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) says plans are in place to bring the number of armed police back up to about 7,000 this year. This is only partly funded by government - forces must find some of the cash themselves.Elsewhere in the UK, police numbers in Scotland have risen more or less continuously for the past 30 years while in Northern Ireland there has been a smaller decrease since 2010 than in England and Wales.Overall police budgets, excluding counter-terrorism grants, fell by 20% between 2010 and 2015. Since 2015, the overall policing budget has been protected in real terms, but not every force will benefit.Over the same period, the ring-fenced counter-terrorism grant has been rising in line with inflation.The NPCC does not disclose counter-terrorism police officer numbers but there has been a large increase in counter-terrorism spending since a specific grant was introduced in 2001-02.How this grant is shared out across police forces has not been made public in recent years for security reasons but the Metropolitan Police force is the national lead on counter-terrorism and is likely to receive a significant share.In autumn 2015, the then Chancellor George Osborne promised to spend £3.4bn extra on counter-terrorism - an increase of 30% - over the following five years. This was to be allocated to several different agencies working on counter-terrorism, not just police forces.Counter-terrorism policing operates as a network with bases across the UK and resources, including officers and other staff, can be allocated where the need is greatest.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

2018-02-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180212221825/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

She said the parties were trying to find an accommodation in which one language is not valued over another in a way which amounts to cultural or language supremacy.Mrs Foster was asked on several occasions whether the package she is discussing includes an Irish language act or bill, but did not directly answer the question.The DUP leader said her test for any proposal is whether it impinges on the rights of those who are British or in any way weakens the union.Her message was reinforced by a standard letter issued to DUP elected representatives to use if they receive any criticism.The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the BBC,  says the party's manifesto makes it ""absolutely clear"" that the DUP ""won't sign up to any deal that diminishes Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom"".It elaborates on some of the aspects touched on by Mrs Foster, saying that ""if that's the price of a deal, then there will be no deal"".Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said the DUP needed to ""make up their mind"" about whether they are ""up for a deal or not"".""They [the DUP] know that the agreement requires an Acht Gaeilge.""""There is a responsibility on all involved not to react to some of the noise from people who simply don't want an agreement,"" he added.

2018-02-13,New AM Jack Sargeant in justice vow,https://web.archive.org//web/20180213225437/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-43044182,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNew AM Jack Sargeant has vowed in his first Senedd speech to ensure inquiries ongoing into the first minister's conduct will examine how his father was treated in the run-up to his death.The 23-year-old successfully held Carl Sargeant's Alyn and Deeside seat for Labour in a by-election last week.He said he knew he was not the only AM ""who wants justice for my father"".Carl Sargeant was found dead four days after he was sacked by First Minister Carwyn Jones in November.The former cabinet secretary for communities and children had also been suspended from the Labour Party amid allegations of inappropriate conduct towards women, which he denied. It is thought he took his own life.A QC-led inquiry is due to get under way into the first minister's handling of the sacking. A separate investigation has also begun into claims that Mr Jones misled the assembly when answering questions about alleged bullying within the Welsh Government in 2014.""I said last week that the by-election was one which no-one wanted to see,"" Mr Sargeant told AMs on Tuesday in his first Senedd speech, with the first minister sitting nearby.He said: ""I know I am not the only person in this chamber who wants justice for my father.""I know from the campaign we have just conducted that this feeling is also shared by my constituents in Alyn and Deeside.""Wearing his father's tie and tie-pin, he said he would work ""to ensure that the inquiries under way will examine the way in which my dad was treated in the run-up to his death"". ""I owe my family, my constituents, my friends and my father no less,"" he added.New assembly members traditionally pay tribute to their predecessors but when that person happens to be your father it adds a layer of emotion to proceedings.As well as the tributes, there was also plenty about manufacturing in north east Wales, which is clearly what Jack Sargeant wants to champion in his new role.But in the short term at least, he will pack the biggest punch when he speaks about the inquiries into the death of his father.He has touched on this territory before, including in his victory speech at the count in Alyn and Deeside, but to do so in the chamber within a matter of feet of the first minister made this uncomfortable viewing.That said, I am told from both sides that the two men had an amicable discussion under the circumstances in a meeting alongside the Economy Secretary Ken Skates.In his speech Jack Sargeant paid tribute to his father, calling him the ""glue that held our family together"".""My dad truly loved the community and the people of Alyn and Deeside. He loved the sense of togetherness,"" he said. ""Our community's problems are everyone's problems, and that's clear by the way local people come together when times get tough.""""We are of course devastated beyond words,"" Mr Sargeant said, ""and we know our grief has and will continue to be shared by all those who knew and loved him.""I hope that as the representative of a new generation in this assembly, I can do something to build a better, kinder politics for the future,"" he added.Mr Sargeant was applauded by AMs in the chamber at the beginning and the end of his speech.Earlier, he met the first minister for the first time since the death of his father at the weekly gathering of Labour AMs. "

Black Rod summons MPs to the Lords to hear the Queen's Speech but has the door to the House of Commons slammed in their face, and has to knock three times to gain entry.They are the monarch's representative in the House of Lords and the routine is symbolic of the House of Commons' independence from the Crown."

If the Bank raised rates in line with market expectations, they would reach 1% by the end of this year.The ONS said that although petrol prices had risen by less than this time last year, the cost of entry to attractions such as zoos and gardens fell more slowly. It said, however, that after rising strongly since the middle of 2016, food price inflation now appeared to be slowing.ONS senior statistician James Tucker said: ""Factory goods price inflation continued to slow, with food prices falling in January. The growth in the cost of raw materials also slowed, with the prices of some imported materials falling.""Inflation was given a steep boost by the UK's vote in 2016 to leave the European Union.It prompted a fall in the pound, making imported goods more expensive.Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ""UK inflation came in higher than expected in January, adding further pressure for policymakers to hike interest rates again, possibly as soon as May. ""However, with mounting signs of economic growth slowing at the start of 2018, a May rate rise is by no means a done deal and will likely be dependent on the data flow improving in coming months.""Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that data was likely to show inflationary pressures easing: ""CPI inflation still looks set to fall sharply this year, as the anniversaries of sharp sterling-related rises in core goods, food and energy prices are met. ""The fall back in oil prices to $63, from $70 in mid-January, also has brightened the near-term outlook.""He said this gave the Bank of England ""more scope than it currently envisages to delay the next rate hike"".Mel Stride, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said: ""The good news is that inflation is expected to fall this year. We are helping cut costs for hard pressed families by boosting pay, cutting taxes for millions of people and freezing fuel duty at the pumps.""

2018-02-13,UK unveils extremism blocking tool,https://web.archive.org//web/20180213225437/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43037899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has unveiled a tool it says can accurately detect jihadist content and block it from being viewed.Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC she would not rule out forcing technology companies to use it by law.Ms Rudd is visiting the US to meet tech companies to discuss the idea, as well as other efforts to tackle extremism.Thousands of hours of content posted by the Islamic State group was run past  the tool, in order to ""train"" it to automatically spot extremist material.The government provided £600,000 of public funds towards the creation of the tool by an artificial intelligence company based in London.ASI Data Science said the software can be configured to detect 94% of IS video uploads.Anything the software identifies as potential IS material would be flagged up for a human decision to be taken.The company said it typically flagged 0.005% of non-IS video uploads. On a site with five million daily uploads, it would flag 250 non-IS videos for review.It is intended to lighten the moderation burden faced by small companies that may not have the resources to effectively tackle extremist material being posted on their sites.Similar tools in the past have been heavily criticised by advocates of an ""open"" internet, saying such efforts can produce false positives - and that means content that is not particularly problematic ends up being taken down or blocked.In London, reporters were given an off-the-record briefing detailing how ASI's software worked, but were asked not to share its precise methodology. However, in simple terms, it is an algorithm that draws on characteristics typical of IS and its online activity.In Silicon Valley, the home secretary told the BBC the tool was made as a way to demonstrate that the government's demand for a clampdown on extremist activity was not unreasonable.""It's a very convincing example of the fact that you can have the information you need to make sure this material doesn't go online in the first place,"" she said.""The technology is there. There are tools out there that can do exactly what we're asking for. For smaller companies, this could be ideal.""Silicon Valley giants such as Facebook and Google are pouring their own resources into solving this problem, but this tool is at first intended to be used by small companies, and they may one day be forced to use it.""We're not going to rule out taking legislative action if we need to do it,"" the home secretary said.""But I remain convinced that the best way to take real action, to have the best outcomes, is to have an industry-led forum like the one we've got.""The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, launched last year, brings together several governments including the US and UK, and major internet firms like Facebook, Google, Twitter and others.However, the bigger challenge is predicting which parts of the internet that jihadis will use next.The Home Office estimates that between July and the end of 2017, extremist material appeared in almost 150 web services that had not been used for such propaganda before."

Tory MP Maria Miller said changes to workplace culture were clearly needed. The inquiry follows a string of allegations of harassment and bullying against leading figures in the US film and media industries, as well as claims of inappropriate behaviour in Parliament and other high-profile British institutions. Announcing the inquiry, the committee's chair, Mrs Miller - a former Conservative cabinet minister - said women had come forward to speak about the ""appalling experiences"" that they had faced in a number of different sectors. The cross-party committee, she said, would look at the extent of the problem in British workplaces, who the perpetrators were, why it was continuing to happen and how it could best be tackled.The MPs will consider the scope of victims for legal redress, including employment tribunals and other forms of dispute resolution, as well as the use of non-disclosure agreements.Critics says these confidentiality agreements have been used to buy the silence of victims of harassment and assault. ""We took some evidence in January from experts in this area who told us that they felt many of these non-disclosure agreements were actually unenforceable because it isn't lawful to ask somebody to cover up criminal wrong-doing in this way,"" Mrs Miller told BBC News.""But many of those who are forced to sign non-disclosure agreements really have very little knowledge of the law and wouldn't be aware that they're being asked to do something which is unlawful in itself.""The cross-party committee is already looking at women's experiences of everyday sexism in public places. Under proposals published last week, MPs found to have bullied or harassed their staff will have to write a letter of apology and undergo training while, in more serious cases, they could be suspended or forced to face a public vote on their future.The committee also called for a new code of behaviour, independent of the political parties, applying to everyone on the Parliamentary estate, including visitors."

But the report said consumers should not be penalised if they did not shop around.Five million of the UK's most vulnerable households, many of whom pay using pre-payment meters, already have their energy bills capped. But with the cost of producing energy expected to rise in the Spring those households were recently told they should expect a rise in their energy bills.An Ofgem spokesperson said it was pressing ahead with plans to protect energy consumers in expectation of the new legislation. The regulator said ""innovative solutions"" such as its scheme to trial ""collective switching"" which would allow consumers to group together to gain better deals, would help households reduce their energy bills Ofgem said.The Business Secretary, Greg Clark, said the report confirmed that "" the energy market isn't working for customers stuck on rip-off tariffs"".He said that the government's plan to introduce a price cap would protect consumers from high energy bills.MPs backed the government's plan for the cap on standard variable tariffs to be set at an ""absolute"" or fixed level, rather than be ""relative"" or set at a maximum difference to other fixed tariffs available to customers.They said a relative cap might create a perverse incentive for suppliers to increase their lowest prices to maintain overall profits.Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at the price comparison and switching service uSwitch said any price cap might ""do more harm than good"" if it undermined competition between energy companies.""A widespread price cap could lull energy customers into a false sense of security if they think they are protected by it,"" he said.Energy UK, a body representing the industry said more customers were already switching suppliers to get better deals and that the cap could hamper competition.""It's also important that the cap accurately reflects suppliers' costs, most of which are out of their direct control,""  said Energy UK's chief executive Lawrence Slade."

The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"

Reality Check verdict: Yes, according to the OECD, but only when the cost of childcare is applied to a specific demographic - in this case, a relatively well-off couple. The claim that the UK has the highest childcare costs in the world was made by campaigner Joeli Brearley.Ms Brearley was referencing a study carried out by an international economic body, the OECD, which provides a snapshot of childcare costs among its 35 members.One important thing to note is that even though the OECD refers to the United Kingdom, its study only looks at childcare costs in England. That's because the other nations have different childcare policies and the OECD has not produced separate findings for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.That aside, what does the data reveal?The graph shows what it would cost to send two children (aged two and three) to a ""typical"" childcare centre (or nursery) for at least 40 hours each week.It assumes both parents are in full-time employment, where one parent earns an average wage and the second parent earns 67% of average earnings.The study also takes into account any financial support provided by governments, such as child benefit, to help towards childcare costs.On this measure, the UK (England) is clearly way out in front with the net cost of childcare working out at 55% of average earnings. This is 15 percentage points higher than New Zealand, the next most expensive country.But before drawing any firm conclusions, there are some important points to consider.Firstly, the data needs to be understood in the context of who is affected.In this example - which the claim is based on - we're looking at a relatively well-off couple. Parents on lower incomes in England may be eligible for additional support, which will reduce their childcare costs.Mike Brewer, an economics professor from the University of Essex, says that the childcare element of the working tax credit (which is being replaced by universal credit) is heavily means-tested and ""very generous to low-paid families"" relative to other countries.Under the childcare element of universal credit, parents in the UK can receive up to 85% of childcare costs.So with that in mind, what happens if the same analysis is carried out but this time it's applied to a single parent earning half the average wage?When taking this particular snapshot, England falls from being the most expensive OECD country for childcare down to eighth.  As Prof Brewer observes: ""The results in England depend heavily on what sort of family you have in mind, especially when it comes to their earnings, given that we means-test some support.""There are some other important caveats to consider.For one, the study only looks at nursery as a childcare option and not other forms, like childminders or nannies.In the UK, nurseries tend to be viewed as a premium product and more expensive than childminders.Furthermore, the data was compiled back in 2015 and doesn't reflect recent changes in childcare costs or new government policy.Since September, most working parents in England have been entitled to receive 30 hours of free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds.The Department for Education says that 202,783 children in England benefited from the policy and that families could save £5,000 per year on childcare costs.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Here are the answers to the things you wanted to know.Samuel Jones, 25, from Huddersfield asked: ""Is there any way we, the people, can fight this? If a utility bill goes up I can simply leave that company, here do I have no choice but to pay?""Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said councils were allowed to raise tax by 3% this year. Larger authorities which fund social care can increase it up to 5.99%.You cannot appeal your bill simply because you think it is too expensive, according to the Valuation Office Agency.But under certain circumstances, such as believing you are in the wrong council tax band, an appeal is possible.All adults must pay council tax unless they are a full time student or meet other exemption criteria.If you don't pay, your local authority can ask magistrates to issue a liability order.This would allow the council to take money from your wages or benefits, or instruct bailiffs to remove goods to cover the arrears.This question came from David Taylor, 71, from Surrey.In 2016-17 councils and other bodies across England paid £7.4bn in pension contributions, although it's uncertain exactly how much of that was funded by council tax.During that period, people in England paid £26bn in council tax, which accounted for 28% of total local government funding.If 28% of local authority pension contributions that year came from council tax, then the cost would be about £2bn.That amounts to 8p of every £1 of council tax paid in England.Councils use any money made by recycling to offset the cost of bin collections according to Lee Marshall, chief executive of the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee.""It will depend on the contract with the other companies in the chain as to if the council gets any money back and how much it is,"" he said. ""If they do receive any money, it goes back into the council budget and they usually put it towards the cost of bin collections,"" he said.""Councils don't make lots of money out of recycling, it just means it's slightly less expensive to collect the waste in the first place.""""Core central government funding to councils will be further reduced by half over the next two years,"" said a spokesman for the Local Government Association.This funding will be almost phased out completely by the end of the decade, he said.""Councils also face an unprecedented surge in demand for children's services and homelessness support,"" he said. ""This is leaving increasingly less money for councils to fund other services, like fixing potholes, cleaning streets and running leisure centres and libraries. ""As a result councils in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed £5bn by 2020.""The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has said its finance settlement ""strikes a balance"" between relieving pressure on councils and ensuring taxpayers ""do not face excessive bills"".A spokesman previously told the BBC councils would see a ""real-term increase in resources over the next two years"".He added that more control had also been given to councils over the business rates they raise locally so ""millions of pounds"" could stay in communities."
2018-02-13,Slow progress?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180213225437/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42989884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAnother gathering in Downing Street has come and gone, imagined at one point to be a ""crunch meeting"" at which Cabinet colleagues might thrash out their differences on the destination of Brexit. In fact, it was nothing of the kind. The only crunching to be seen or heard was the gentle crump of the metaphorical tin can labelled ""Britain's future after Brexit"" being kicked, unopened, further down the road.Did we seriously expect anything else? Boris Johnson, and Brexiteers like him, believe that Brexit opens up a world of new opportunities. Former Remainers including Phillip Hammond, the chancellor, are believed to quietly fear it could usher in an era of national decline. There is no reconciling these views.So ministers on both sides, and colleagues in between, have chosen with lesser or greater enthusiasm to embrace the government's stated ambition to pursue the goal of ""frictionless trade"" with the EU, with few if any tariff or non-tariff barriers, while simultaneously shuffling off the obligations that go with membership of the EU customs union and single market.  No matter that the chancellor is suspected by many in Whitehall and at Westminster to fear this is unachievable, and to secretly nurse the dream of an eventual rethink, or perhaps the hope that a Brexit transition might somehow go on and on. Never mind that some senior Brexiteers are known to be quietly enthusiastic about the possibility of Brexit negotiations ending with no-deal with the EU, and with Britain trading in future on World Trade Organisation rules, until agreements can be struck with nations around the world.For now, the goal of a future in which the UK both has its cake and eats it serves as the fulcrum upon which two opposing views can balance. When Amber Rudd told Brexiteers via the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the cabinet was ""more united than they think"", this was surely what she meant. Meanwhile, the paper published by HMRC officials last August set out practical means of managing cross-border trade, while leaving the tricky business of striking a trade deal with the EU, or failing to do so, to their political masters.The practical talk in cabinet, I'm told by one senior minister, encompassed the UK's future relationship with the EU on the point of alignment of trading rules and regulations. There's broad agreement among ministers that Britain should set its own rules and standards, and not automatically accept diktats from Brussels. Yet it is also recognised that trade with Europe requires compliance with the standards enshrined in those same rules. The distinction may seem rather Jesuitical to some. But to Brexit enthusiasts, and to 10 Downing Street, it is a matter of sovereignty and goes to the heart of Brexit as an idea. British and EU trading standards are perfectly aligned now, it's argued, and there's no intention on the British side to lower those standards, still less to go down the route to what Brussels calls ""social dumping"" and reduce workers' rights. Arguments over any divergence in regulations could go to some form of arbitration.""The Treasury just wants to stay in or close to a customs union,"" said a minister, ""but they won't win that one"". And what about the European Commission?""They just want to stay in control.""So, the moment of decision awaits further down the road. Brexiteer ministers insist talk in Brussels that the UK cannot cherry pick, cannot enjoy free access to markets without accepting free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court is merely a negotiating position. ""It's the starting position, not the end. Michel Barnier (the EU's chief negotiator) does not speak for the entire European Union...can you imagine the Netherlands wanting to put up barriers?""Theresa May told MPs at Prime Minister's Questions: ""As I have said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off and all sorts of things being said about positions, but what matters is the position that we take in the negotiations as we sit down to negotiate the best deal. ""We have shown that we can do that; we did it December and we will do it again."" In other words, ""trust me"". But the pressure on Mrs May to mark out her own preferred destination keeps mounting - especially from Brexiteers who'd like her to tell Brussels to accept Britain's terms or live with no deal at all. The moment she does so the Cold War in her party between rival ministers and rival factions would likely warm up very quickly.There is also a more urgent problem: securing a Brexit transition at the European Council on 22 March. Without an agreement, Britain will suddenly be (forgive the mixed metaphor) looking down the barrel of a Brexit cliff-edge. Fears among business leaders would reach a new pitch, threatening investment and jobs. And the government would need to prepare itself, and warn the businesses it has been trying to reassure that a hard Brexit was at least a real possibility. Obstacles to a transition deal have not yet been resolved. They include the rights of EU migrants who arrive in Britain after the transition. There is still no clear or detailed answer to the problem of the border on the island of Ireland. Downing Street says trading regimes will remain aligned. Dublin is widely believed to want to push the UK to maintain a customs union. Any new, or old obstacle, could appear, or reappear. Who knows? Gibraltar?Ultimately, the mythical tin can marked ""Britain's future after Brexit"" must come home to roost (to mix another metaphor). In the Autumn, clear positions will be required on both the UK and EU side if there is to be a document - at the very least setting out ""heads of agreement"" on the future relationship. At that point Parliament will have its say. A ""meaningful vote"" is promised. On its outcome rests Brexit, Tory unity, Theresa May's future and conceivably that of the government. A cabinet minister observed recently that the prime minister seemed to be privately philosophical about the state of her premiership and her government: ""She said 'it goes with the territory'""Perhaps, in another life, Mrs May commanded a bomb disposal unit."

International aid summits since the 1970s have been urging countries to spend 0.7% of their national income on overseas development assistance (ODA), popularly known as foreign aid.The UK government first did so in 2013, and approved legislation requiring it to do so in 2015. In 2016, that translated to a total spend of £13.4bn, according to the Department for International Development.Some of that money went to charities. Oxfam received £31.7m from the UK government, which is about a quarter of a percent of what the government spends on foreign aid each year.But it is a sizeable chunk of Oxfam's funding. The charity had a total income of £409m last year, of which £176m came from government and other public authorities. Of the rest, £108m came from donations and legacies and £91m from sales in its shops.Its total income put it at number four on the list of UK charities, behind Cancer Research, the British Heart Foundation and Macmillan Cancer Support, according to the 2017 Top 100 Charities Fundraising Spotlight.About 64% of UK foreign aid is bilateral aid, which is sent directly to the countries involved. Last year, the top three recipients were Pakistan, Syria and Ethiopia.The remaining 36% is multilateral aid, which is distributed by international organisations including charities.The top recipient of UK multilateral aid is the International Development Association, which is part of the World Bank. It received £1.1bn from the UK last year.The second item in the graph above was the part of the UK's contribution to the EU budget that may be counted as development aid.The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future.Oxfam's £31.7m puts it just outside the top 20 recipients of multilateral aid.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-13,"Hey, big overspenders",https://web.archive.org//web/20180213225437/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-northamptonshire-42958465,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window Northamptonshire County Council has said it is in financial trouble and is banning all new spending, raising questions about the financial health of local authorities across England. Analysis by the BBC England Data Unit has found that around one in every three local authorities spent more on services in 2016-17 than they expected to.How did Northamptonshire get into trouble and could it happen anywhere else?According to statistics from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, the authority spent £43m more in 2016-17 than it had budgeted for.At the start of the financial year Northamptonshire County Council said it would spend £706m on providing services such as education, social care, public health, street lighting and running rubbish tips.  Yet the authority ended up spending £749m on these services, which is 6.1% more than in its budget. Across England of those councils that overspent, the average overspend in 2016-17 was 3.1%.Away from day to day spending Northamptonshire council says it currently has £608m in outstanding loan debts and £194m in Private-Finance Initiative liabilities.The means the council's combined debts of £802m are greater than its planned budget spend of £706m.Over the past five financial years the council saw on average a 35% overspend on children's social care and an average of seven per cent overspend on adult social care services. It has also had the largest increase in spend on agency workers for social workers anywhere in the UK.Northamptonshire County Council says it has faced ""unprecedented demand for local services for a number of years, coupled with reducing levels of funding from central government"". ""The reliance on agency staff in social care is an issue faced by many local authorities across the country,"" a spokesman said. He said heavy investment in children's services came following an ""inadequate"" Ofsted rating in 2013 and that spending on agency staff had dropped after recruiting more social workers.Northamptonshire is the first council in nearly two decades to issue a section 114 notice, which effectively stops all new expenditure. Only statutory services for safeguarding vulnerable people are exempt. The last one was Hackney in 2000.The body that speaks for local councils, the Local Government Association (LGA) says money for local councils ""is running out fast"" and that local authorities face a funding gap of £5.8bn over the next two years. Government figures show there were 113 councils in England that spent more than their net current expenditure budgets in 2016-17.This does not mean all these councils are in financial trouble, but with one in every three councils spending more than was in their budgets, means many local authorities have clearly struggled.According to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), councils are allowed to dip into their reserves to prop up their spending and can run a deficit if they have the means to fund it.""However it is illegal for planned expenditure in the current or a future year to exceed budgeted resources and available reserves,"" Cipfa says. ""In such cases the chief finance officer must statutorily enforce an expenditure freeze and the council respond and adjust its plans for the year in question.""The BBC's analysis compares what councils estimated they would spend on services with what they actually spent.However some of the spending would have been off-set by government grants or savings.Selby District Council in Yorkshire said that despite government figures showing it spent £4.6m more on services than estimated at the start of the financial year, it finished 2016-17 with a £400,000 saving.The council said it was ""sustainable now and in the long-term"" and had been given a ""clean bill of health"" by auditors.South Hams District Council in Devon said it would spend £31.5m on services in 2016-17 but reported spending £38m.The council said government grants covered most of the additional spending.However, it was still left with a £45,000 overspend, equivalent to 0.5% of the budget.From the rising numbers of children going to school to a fall in the amount of money councils receive from central government, demands on local authorities are rising, whilst resources are being stretched.The biggest pressure on council budgets is social care, which involves looking after vulnerable children and a growing older adult population.Five years ago councils in England were spending slightly less than they had provided for in their social care budgets. But in 2016-17 local authorities spent £1.1bn more on social care than was in their budgets.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says that over the next four years councils across England will get real terms increases in their budgets.As the department plans to spend £200bn as part of a four year financial settlement. And when asked in the House of Commons whether he knew of any other councils in financial difficulty, the local government minister Rishi Sunak said: ""It would be inappropriate to give a running commentary on every conversation I have with local councils, but the department keeps in constant contact with councils and we keep the situation in constant review"".An independent inspector has been appointed to look at the financial situation of Northamptonshire County Council, which is expected to report back by 16 March 2018."
2018-02-13,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180213225437/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

Power sharing and working together are the only way forward for Northern Ireland. The Tanaiste and the Secretary of State are in close contact and we will continue to confer with the British Government about the next steps.End of Twitter post  by @campaignforleoAnalysis: BBC News NI political correspondent Enda McClaffertyAt Stormont on Wednesday, you could sense that things were not going well behind the scenes.There was a great sense of optimism last week.But it became pretty clear there was a standoff developing after Tuesday.Arlene Foster had appeared before the cameras and said that a stand-alone Irish language act was not something the DUP could accept.Sinn Féin came out and said there would be no deal unless it included one of those.We understand both parties met on Wednesday morning and quickly realised there was going to be no middle ground on an Irish language act.Then it was a matter of who was going to pull the plug first.Reporters were waiting in Stormont's Great Hall and we all thought we would hear from Sinn Féin first.Then the statement from Mrs Foster popped up on Twitter, making it very clear that this phase of negotiations was over.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was ""disappointed"" and ""angry"" at the failure of the talks, and claimed it had left the Good Friday Agreement ""in peril"".He said the Stormont parties must resist a return to direct rule from Westminster, with ""the DUP having the whip hand"".Under an agreement struck last summer, the Conservative government relies on the DUP's support to stay in power at Westminster.Mr Eastwood said the parties must ""not allow this moment to be the destruction of all that we have achieved"".""We can't allow this British government, or this DUP to think that they're going to govern Northern Ireland on their own - that cannot be allowed to happen,"" the SDLP leader said.Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), described the talks process as a ""shambles"".He said: ""What I think we need to know, and what Northern Ireland clearly needs to know, is the door to devolution now firmly closed?""Mr Swann called on the Northern Ireland secretary to provide clarity on whether it was the end of the talks or whether more negotiations were planned.The leader of Alliance Party, Naomi Long, said there was ""no prospect of a deal and no process in place that could lead to a deal"".""We are in a very precarious situation at this point in time, we are essentially in uncharted territory,"" she added.Hopes of an imminent deal had been ""falsely raised"" over the weekend, she said, and ""now we have seen them dashed yet again"".Speculation of a breakthrough mounted over the weekend, as both the UK and Irish leaders prepared to travel to Stormont to help seal a deal.But Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Varadkar left Belfast on Monday with no sign of agreement.Former DUP minister Simon Hamilton described their visit as ""a bit of a distraction"".""I don't think it was entirely helpful in getting us to a successful conclusion,"" he told a press conference on Wednesday.Northern Ireland has been run by civil servants since the power-sharing executive made up of the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed in January last year.The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness pulled Sinn Féin out of the coalition after a bitter split between the governing parties.Londonderry Chamber of Commerce President, Jennifer McKeever said the lack of a deal was ""disappointing and frustrating"".""The collapse of the latest round of talks will come as another body blow for businesses in the North West which are facing the greatest economic challenge of our generation,"" she said. ""Thirteen months is too long to be without devolved government and the lack of leadership from Stormont in the Brexit negotiations has been particularly frustrating for the business community,"" she added."

In the end these are people's feelings and people's feelings matter.""""We must accept that many [Remainers] are actuated by entirely noble sentiments, a real sense of solidarity with our European neighbours and a desire for the UK to succeed,"" he said.""If we are to carry this project through to national success - as we must - then we must also reach out to those who still have anxieties.""I want to try to anatomise at least some of those fears and to show... that Brexit is not grounds for fear but hope.""According to Mr Johnson, Brexit is ""not some great V-sign from the cliffs of Dover"", but ""the expression of legitimate and natural desire to self govern of the people"".""That is surely not some reactionary Farageist concept,"" he added in a reference to former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who hit back on Twitter.As for @BorisJohnson’s comment on “Faragiste reactionaries”, he should be careful - 72% of the public wanted tighter immigration controls at the time of the EU referendum. They now want to see a clear plan.End of Twitter post  by @Nigel_FarageAlongside his calls to Brexit supporters not to ""gloat"" and ""sit back in silent satisfaction"", Mr Johnson said holding another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU - as some campaigners are calling for - would be a ""disastrous mistake that would lead to permanent and ineradicable feelings of betrayal"".He frequently used variants of the 2016 referendum's ""take back control"" argument - on things like regulations and tariffs so businesses did not have laws affecting them ""imposed from abroad"" when they have no power to elect or remove the people making them.It would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit, he said.Mr Johnson said the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters, saying other countries were able to trade with the EU without paying membership fees.However, during a transition period immediately after the UK leaves in March 2019 things would ""remain as they are"", he said.Pro-EU campaigners hit back at his overtures to Remain voters - with Labour MP Chuka Umunna describing the speech as an ""exercise in hypocrisy"".Mr Umunna, of the anti ""hard Brexit"" Open Britain campaign, said: ""We are already a great country, we are already internationalist and we are already global.""Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said the speech revealed the government's intention to ""casually cast aside"" rights and protections and ignore the benefits of the EU single market.""Nobody will be fooled or reassured by the foreign secretary's empty rhetoric,"" he said.Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston accused Mr Johnson of an ""optimism bias"" about the benefits of Brexit.The SNP's Brexit spokesman Stephen Gethins said he was not reassured by Mr Johnson's speech and said the government ""still can't really tell us what leaving the EU will mean"".And Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said the speech was mainly about ""Boris' ambitions to become the next prime minister"".Conservative MP Nigel Evans said the foreign secretary had reflected the views of many people, irrespective of how they voted in 2016, that the UK now needed to get on with the process of leaving.""It's also about the opportunities that are now going to exist for the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the speech may have come as a surprise to those who, in his opinion, mistakenly believed the government was set ""to reinvent a customs union, forego an independent trade policy and accept the need to follow all new EU laws"".That Boris speech - we know that the Foreign Secretary’s speech today was checked and approved by 10 Downing Street, and is a statement of government policy. https://t.co/LR3FK9h3HLEnd of Twitter post  by @johnredwoodFor many Remainers, Boris Johnson is the bogeyman of Brexit, heartily loathed for his approach and some of his claims during the referendum campaign.He set himself an ambitious aim of trying to reassure Remainers - but at times it sounded as if we were back in the campaign, which served to highlight just how divisive that debate was.I was left with the thought that perhaps the person most relieved would be Theresa May, as he repeatedly and doggedly stuck to the principles set out in her Lancaster House speech.Asked about Mr Johnson's speech, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hit back at suggestions from some critics he is seeking to create an EU ""superstate"".Mr Juncker replied: ""Some in the British political society are against the truth, pretending that I am a stupid, stubborn federalist, that I am in favour of a European superstate.""I am strictly against a European superstate. We are not the United States of America, we are the European Union, which is a rich body because we have these 27, or 28, nations.""The European Union cannot be built against the European nations, so this is total nonsense."""

But the laughing stopped when a British journalist asked him about the foreign secretary's suggestion that there was a plan to build an EU superstate.  ""Total nonsense,"" said President Juncker, who complained that the British political class always misrepresents him.But he had just spoken about plans for a bigger EU budget and his dream of a directly-elected president of the EU, which some might say made Boris Johnson's point for him. The foreign secretary's speech has been noted in Brussels - particularly his reference to organic carrots - but negotiators are waiting for the UK to adopt a formal position about its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union."

2018-02-14,"Give tenants a right to pets, says Labour",https://web.archive.org//web/20180214232233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43045552,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour wants to strengthen the rights of tenants to keep a pet in their properties as part of a package of proposed animal welfare measures. Some rental agreements drawn up by landlords insist on no animals. Tenants can seek permission to keep pets but Labour wants a default right for them to do so unless there is evidence their pet will be a nuisance.Other Labour ideas include a ban on foie gras imports and an end to the export of live animals for slaughter.Shadow Environment Secretary Sue Hayman told the BBC that the party was promising action on issues that were ""close to people's hearts"".She rejected claims that Labour was ""playing catch-up"" with the Conservatives, saying its ""comprehensive, long-term"" plans were in contrast to the government's ""haphazard, piecemeal"" approach. In recent months, Environment Secretary Michael Gove has proposed increasing maximum sentences for serious animal cruelty to five years in jail and said a ban on pet shops and other third parties selling puppies should be explored as part of a crackdown on unscrupulous breeders. He has also published draft legislation which would commit the government to treat animals as ""sentient beings"" when it makes future laws, following a political row over the issue at the end of last year. Despite the flurry of activity from the government, Labour is insisting it remains ""the party of animal welfare"", citing its backing for the 2005 hunting ban and past steps to tighten the rules on the transport of live animals.The party is now proposing to go further by prohibiting the live export of animals for slaughter or fattening and requiring all slaughterhouses to have CCTV installed.The 50-point draft policy document - entitled Animal Welfare for the Many not the Few - also proposes:Among the most eye-catching proposals is a plan to strengthen the right of tenants to have pets in their homes, which Labour said was a recognition of the growing number of people having to rent well into their 30s. Under the 2015 Consumer Rights Act, a landlord can only refuse permission if it is reasonable to do so, for instance on grounds of the animal's size, the damage it could cause and its impact on future rental prospects. Under Labour's plans, which it says it wants to discuss with landlords and tenant bodies, there would need to be evidence that the animal was a nuisance for permission to be refused. The National Landlords Association said its members should have the right to refuse tenants with pets as long as they justified their actions, including in cases where properties were simply not geared up for animals. But the group's chief executive Richard Lambert added that ""tenants who keep pets do tend to stay for longer periods of time, and there are a few simple steps that landlords can take in order to mitigate the perceived increased risks"" - including insisting on larger deposits. Shelter said that while it was often difficult for landlords to enforce conditions relating to pets, tenants were at greater risk of eviction if they were in breach of tenancy agreements. Labour also envisages creating a new post of animal welfare commissioner, to ensure government policy is continually abreast of the latest scientific evidence. This would also mean animal welfare is taken into consideration in trade deals after Brexit, and in the UK's dealings with international bodies.After the UK leaves the EU, Labour says future farming subsidies must reflect the need to outlaw bad environmental practice and move away from intensive rearing techniques.Responding for the Conservatives, MP Steve Double said ""from introducing mandatory CCTV into slaughter houses to increasing the maximum sentence for animal cruelty ten-fold, the Conservatives will continue taking the action needed to ensure animals receive the proper protection they deserve."" It emerged earlier this month that the government is considering its own ban on the export of live animals for slaughter, and will launch a consultation in the spring.Theresa May, meanwhile, has ruled out a Commons vote on repealing the ban on hunting with dogs during the current Parliament, reversing a manifesto commitment for a free vote. Analysis by Reality CheckCurrently, motorists only have to report an accident involving an animal if they hit certain animals. The Road Traffic Act 1988 requires drivers to inform the police if ""damage is caused"" to horses, cattle, asses, mules, sheep, pigs, goats or dogs. This list excludes cats and poultry, but also wildlife such as badgers and deer. Last year, a petition was launched to seek parity between cats and dogs in the reporting of roadside accidents, reaching 237,500 signatures. Complete statistics are not produced on the amount of animals killed by vehicles each year, but information released by Highways England gives some indication of the animals most likely to be hit. Between January 2016 and April 2017, 611 deer, 534 badgers and 471 foxes were found dead on A-roads and motorways in England. Around 170 cats and dogs were found too; as well as one wallaby on the M1. "

He was then driven to the prison where an attempt was made to substitute the man in place of Mr Adams. Mr Adams was arrested in the staff car park and was subsequently sentenced to 18 months in jail for attempting to escape.Mr Adams began his legal bid to overturn the two convictions in July 2017.Lawyers acting for Mr Adams in the Court of Appeal in Belfast had argued that the order for his internment was legally flawed.Their bid to overturn the convictions was based on government papers recovered from the National Archives in London. They said that a junior minister had signed the necessary document in 1975, when it should have been the Northern Ireland secretary.However, counsel for the Public Prosecution Service argued that a long-established legal doctrine allowed other ministerial figures to lawfully authorise Mr Adams' internment.The appeal with Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, Sir Reg Weir and Sir Ronald Weatherup.

She was arrested on spying charges in April 2016, accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government. Her husband Richard said his wife has experienced difficulty walking as well as extreme hair and weight loss. Redress has written to the UN special rapporteur on behalf of the mother's family, stating that evidence ""strongly suggests"" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's treatment amounts to torture. The letter says her treatment has had serious effects on her physical and mental health, in an attempt ""to demoralise her and put her in a situation of complete powerlessness.""Mr Ratcliffe, from Hampstead in London, said: ""It's very hard for both of us to be hopeful at this point. We were obviously very hopeful at Christmas [for her release] and it didn't happen.""It's always good to hold on to the 'maybe', but also part of us putting in the submission now is because it feels like we're just being gamed.""He added the family were ""waiting for the governments to deliver"" on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release. He told the BBC he believes the charity worker is being used as a bargaining chip in political battles that have nothing to do with her. The 39-year-old was detained in Iran when visiting her parents with her daughter, Gabriella, who remains in the country. In December 2017 Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson travelled to Iran to call for the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcllife on humanitarian grounds.Mr Johnson had been criticised for comments he had made to a parliamentary committee in November.  He told MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists in the country.  He later apologised for the comments.Mr Ratcliffe said extra telephone privileges granted to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe after the foreign secretary's visit have been cut back after demonstrations against the Iranian regime in London last month.

The animal welfare charity said it had been campaigning on the issue for around two decades.In a written statement, Ms Griffiths said she intended to learn from MSP's scrutiny of the Scottish legislation, ""particularly discussion of ethical and welfare arguments for a ban"".She said the new Welsh law should ensure the ban does not effect mobile animal exhibits (MAEs), such as travelling falconry and hawking displays, exotic pets taken into schools for education purposes and reindeer at Christmas events.Ms Griffiths said ministers would launch a consultation on introducing a licensing scheme for MAEs later this year.Claire Lawson from RSPCA Cymru said it was a ""momentous day for animals - with the sight of wild animals touring in circuses in Wales set to be consigned to the history books once and for all"".  ""The RSPCA has fought for years to see this ban become a reality - and we are absolutely delighted that the Welsh Government has confirmed its intention to bring forward legislation to end this outdated and cruel practice on this country's soil.""Linda Joyce Jones, who presented a petition with around 3,800 signatures to the Welsh Government in January calling for a ban, welcomed the news and said she ""hopes it will lead to legislation"". ""I'm glad they listened to the people who signed my petition,"" she said. ""Over 30 countries have banned this practice all over the world including Scotland and Ireland. I hope Wales will do same.""A ban on wild animals in all circuses in the Republic of Ireland came into force in January.A total of 18 other EU countries have banned or restricted the use of wild animals in travelling circuses, in addition to 14 other countries.A UK government review in 2007 found insufficient evidence to support a science-based ban on welfare grounds."

""Everyone has a right to use social media without the fear of abuse or intimidation.""He added some attacks on members had come from anonymous accounts. There was no way for the party to know who the individuals are, Mr Jones said, but ""remember that you can report them to the platform moderators in question if they post abusive messages"".Several days before the email was sent, former Plaid Cymru AM and ex-deputy leader Helen Mary Jones said she had faced ""veiled threats, calls for my expulsion and woolly allegations about my supposed participation in some sort of imaginary conspiracy"" on Facebook.She said she received the messages after she had signed a petition that was automatically shared on her page, which called for Mr McEvoy not to be reinstated to the Plaid group. It had pre-dated his expulsion.Ms Jones said it would have been better for her to have posted her support on social media, rather than have signed the petition. But she said she would not put up with ""abuse and threats and insinuations"" and said she would report people if needed.A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said: ""Plaid Cymru takes its respect agenda seriously.""In the current climate where online abuse has intensified, it is only appropriate for the party to fulfil its duty to remind the membership of that fact."""

The MPs' report said ministers should consider taking the process back in-house from Capita, Maximus and Atos when contracts come up for renewal in 2019 and 2020.Committee chairman Labour MP Frank Field said the shortcomings were causing ""untenable"" human and financial cost.""No-one should have any doubt the process needs urgent change,"" he said.A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ""As the Work and Pensions Select Committee highlights, assessments work for the majority of people, with 83% of ESA claimants and 76% of PIP claimants telling us that they're happy with their overall experience.""The DWP had already accepted more than 100 recommendations from five independent reviews of the Work Capability Assessment and commissioned two independent reviews of PIP assessments, he added.Capita said it was ""firmly committed to delivering a high-quality service"" and that its qualified healthcare professionals were ""dedicated to delivering professional and empathetic assessments for all claimants"".The Maximus-operated Centre for Health and Disability Assessments said it had achieved its quality standards in January but was ""fully committed to making further improvements"".And Independent Assessment Services - formerly known as Atos Healthcare - said its focus was on providing a ""professional and compassionate assessment service""."

She said the parties were trying to find an accommodation in which one language is not valued over another in a way which amounts to cultural or language supremacy.Mrs Foster was asked on several occasions whether the package she is discussing includes an Irish language act or bill, but did not directly answer the question.The DUP leader said her test for any proposal is whether it impinges on the rights of those who are British or in any way weakens the union.Her message was reinforced by a standard letter issued to DUP elected representatives to use if they receive any criticism.The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the BBC,  says the party's manifesto makes it ""absolutely clear"" that the DUP ""won't sign up to any deal that diminishes Northern Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom"".It elaborates on some of the aspects touched on by Mrs Foster, saying that ""if that's the price of a deal, then there will be no deal"".Sinn Féin's Conor Murphy said the DUP needed to ""make up their mind"" about whether they are ""up for a deal or not"".""They [the DUP] know that the agreement requires an Acht Gaeilge.""""There is a responsibility on all involved not to react to some of the noise from people who simply don't want an agreement,"" he added.

What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine. ""I drink claret. Two glasses a day. My doctor knows it and says it's OK!""You can hear the full interview with Barbara Hosking on the Emma Barnett Show on BBC 5 live at 12.30 on Wednesday 14 February."

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

2018-02-14,Day of reckoning?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180214232233/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43031541,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe starting pistol for the review of university tuition fees in England will be fired as early as next week.Or at least that's the latest claim in the political twisting and turning over one of the toughest domestic decisions facing a fragile government.The last time Theresa May's review of fees seemed to be approaching, neither the education secretary Justine Greening nor the universities minister Jo Johnson seemed particularly enthusiastic - and within weeks both of them were out of their jobs. The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"
2018-02-14,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180214232233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42966047,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim:  The cost of childcare in the UK is the highest in the world. Reality Check verdict: Yes, according to the OECD, but only when the cost of childcare is applied to a specific demographic - in this case, a relatively well-off couple. The claim that the UK has the highest childcare costs in the world was made by campaigner Joeli Brearley.Ms Brearley was referencing a study carried out by an international economic body, the OECD, which provides a snapshot of childcare costs among its 35 members.One important thing to note is that even though the OECD refers to the United Kingdom, its study only looks at childcare costs in England. That's because the other nations have different childcare policies and the OECD has not produced separate findings for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.That aside, what does the data reveal?The graph shows what it would cost to send two children (aged two and three) to a ""typical"" childcare centre (or nursery) for at least 40 hours each week.It assumes both parents are in full-time employment, where one parent earns an average wage and the second parent earns 67% of average earnings.The study also takes into account any financial support provided by governments, such as child benefit, to help towards childcare costs.On this measure, the UK (England) is clearly way out in front with the net cost of childcare working out at 55% of average earnings. This is 15 percentage points higher than New Zealand, the next most expensive country.But before drawing any firm conclusions, there are some important points to consider.Firstly, the data needs to be understood in the context of who is affected.In this example - which the claim is based on - we're looking at a relatively well-off couple. Parents on lower incomes in England may be eligible for additional support, which will reduce their childcare costs.Mike Brewer, an economics professor from the University of Essex, says that the childcare element of the working tax credit (which is being replaced by universal credit) is heavily means-tested and ""very generous to low-paid families"" relative to other countries.Under the childcare element of universal credit, parents in the UK can receive up to 85% of childcare costs.So with that in mind, what happens if the same analysis is carried out but this time it's applied to a single parent earning half the average wage?When taking this particular snapshot, England falls from being the most expensive OECD country for childcare down to eighth.  As Prof Brewer observes: ""The results in England depend heavily on what sort of family you have in mind, especially when it comes to their earnings, given that we means-test some support.""There are some other important caveats to consider.For one, the study only looks at nursery as a childcare option and not other forms, like childminders or nannies.In the UK, nurseries tend to be viewed as a premium product and more expensive than childminders.Furthermore, the data was compiled back in 2015 and doesn't reflect recent changes in childcare costs or new government policy.Since September, most working parents in England have been entitled to receive 30 hours of free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds.The Department for Education says that 202,783 children in England benefited from the policy and that families could save £5,000 per year on childcare costs.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-14,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180214232233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-14,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180214232233/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will attend for the first time and is expected to raise concerns over Syria. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attempted to reach out to Remain supporters, urging people to unite behind his vision of a ""liberal Brexit"".The devolution of powers, workers' rights and trade are also expected to be covered by other ministers.Mrs May's trip to Berlin comes as the UK and the EU attempt to agree details of the temporary ""transition"" period which will come immediately after Brexit day and is intended to smooth the path to the permanent post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU.Speaking after the last round of talks, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"".The British government, meanwhile, has offered to extend guarantees on EU citizens' rights after Brexit to the 20,000 Norwegian, Icelandic and Liechtensteinian nationals living in the UK.Citizens from the three countries - all members of the European Economic Area - living in the UK for the past five years will be able to apply for settled status on the same basis as nationals from the other 27 EU member states.This would grant them permanent residency and largely the same access as now to healthcare, pensions and other benefits.The UK hopes the offer will be reciprocated and will give similar assurances to the 15,000 British expats in Norway, the 800 in Iceland and 60 in Liechtenstein."

Key recommendations from the report include:An inspection in September 2017 found rats and cockroaches were rife at Liverpool Prison, with one area of the jail so dirty, infested and hazardous it could not be cleaned.Some prisoners were kept for more than 22 hours a day in cells that should be condemned, said inspectors, with exposed electrical wiring and filthy, leaking lavatories.A 2015 inspection led to 89 recommendations, but only 22 had been fully implemented two years later.There were also more than 2,000 outstanding maintenance jobs at the prison, which had its healthcare budget cut last month.The Justice Committee said national, regional and local management had all failed in their oversight of the prison.Mr Neill added: ""It is clear that HMIP require additional resources so they can make sure that their recommendations are properly acted upon.""A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Ministers have been absolutely clear that conditions at HMP Liverpool were unacceptable and we will not stand for them. ""We want to be held accountable when failings persist, which is why Ministers introduced the Urgent Notification process - demanding the Secretary of State introduce tough measures to improve failing prisons.""Head of the prison service Michael Spurr told the committee there was ""a failure at local level to follow through on the recommendations [made by HMIP in 2015]"".He added: ""I accept that from an organisational perspective we did not have enough robust governance above establishment level to make sure that [the recommendations made in 2015] were being delivered properly.""Liverpool Prison's new governor Pia Sinha told the committee she had ""initiated a deep clean of all external areas"" and had increased the number of prisoners cleaning."
2018-02-15,Draft deal in place last week - Sinn Féin,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43074505,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said a draft agreement was in place last week to restore Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive.The talks ended on Wednesday after the DUP declared there was ""no current prospect"" of a deal. Ms McDonald said the agreement included an Irish language Act and the DUP was warned to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.However, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that no draft agreement was in place.Mrs Foster told Sky News that Sinn Féin ""certainly didn't have an offer of an Irish language act"".""We didn't reach an agreement,"" she said.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement - they were insisting that they have this stand-alone Irish language act and that is not something I could sign up to - I have always been very clear about that.""The Prime Minister spoke to the leaders of both Sinn Féin and the DUP on Thursday evening.A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Mrs May ""expressed her disappointment"" that an agreement had not been reached.""The Prime Minister was clear that she still believes the basis for an agreement exists, and urged them both to reflect on the recent phase of talks in order to find the best way forward"".Sinn Féin and the DUP had been in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont.Mrs Foster dismissed claims that she had lost control of her party as ""nonsense"" and said that she had kept her party officers briefed throughout the negotiations.""We have had a number of meetings so I could bring them up to date as to where we are at, but I have never felt that I am in a position that I can make a recommendation and so no recommendation has been made to my officer board,"" she said.Mrs Foster told RTÉ that a ""completely different set of circumstances"" existed in Northern Ireland than in Scotland or Wales, because ""in those places language has not been used as a political demand and that needs to be recognised.""They need to recognise that the majority of people here do not want an Irish language act a la Wales,"" she said.Ms McDonald claimed a draft package in place last week included an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act, and respecting language and diversity act.""The Irish language act included provision for official recognition of Irish, the creation of an Irish language commissioner, the repeal of the ban on Irish in the courts was also to be legislated for,"" the Sinn Féin leader said.""It did not involve at any stage making Irish compulsory or applying quotas to public services. This was not a consideration,"" she added.Ms McDonald said there had been ""no meetings of mind on marriage equality"", but it was agreed that it would be considered in the assembly in the form of a private member's bill.The Sinn Féin leader said the DUP must now explain their position:""The DUP leader brought this phase of negotiations to a close and said 'there is no current prospect of these discussions leading to an Executive being formed'.""It is up to Arlene Foster to explain this given that the DUP and Sinn Féin leaderships had achieved an accommodation across the issues involved."""
2018-02-15,How a deal was not done,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43065460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBack in the tumultuous days after the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal brought down the Stormont Executive, both the DUP and Sinn Féin dug themselves into some very deep holes.Sinn Féin said they wouldn't share power with Arlene Foster as First Minister. Mrs Foster ruled out an Irish Language Act and vowed not to feed the ""crocodiles"".Since then each side's negotiators have been trying to extricate themselves from their respective trenches. As the talks stretched on it became clear Sinn Féin would be willing to drop their refusal to share power with Mrs Foster, but only in return for a clear win on the Irish Language.The DUP softened their position, acknowledging they would legislate for Irish, but only in the context of a wider culture act which addressed their community's concerns.In reality what a law does matters far more than what it is called. However the stand alone Irish Language Act versus an overarching Culture Act took on a totemic significance.The package which the DUP and Sinn Féin have been wrangling over addressed this difference in a convoluted manner. First a new Assembly would have been asked to consider a Respect and Culture Bill.Then Irish and Ulster Scots Bills would follow. All three measures would have become law, with the Irish and Ulster Scots Act eventually forming part of a consolidated Respect and Culture law.Sinn Féin sources say that no matter what the status of the consolidated law turned out to be they would have achieved their all important Irish Language Act which would have remained on the statute books.However unionists would have pointed to the consolidated law as the wider measure they had championed all along.So much for all this dancing on the head of a legislative pin. During the last few days it's become clear that the DUP grassroots are concerned about what any kind of Irish Language law would mean for areas like public sector employment and road signs. Arlene Foster moved to rule out some of the more far fetched fears and DUP representatives were given a pro forma letter to reply to angry e-mails. But senior DUP politicians remained doubtful that, however the package of language laws was dressed up, it would be impossible to sell.Even if a deal had been reached, Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill would have faced a major challenge convincing the public they can work together after so many months of rancour.London and Dublin have both argued that Northern Ireland needs a voice when it comes to Brexit, but the new Executive would have been an administration with two diametrically opposing views on the unique problems Brexit may pose for Northern Ireland.As things stand, it is the Secretary of State Karen Bradley who will now have to consider the way forward. Action on a budget and a rates bill seems inevitable. Will she cut MLAs wages, in line with the recommendations of an independent report?At some point the negotiators may return to the talks table. One joked that the Stormont process has plenty of commas, but no full stops.  Maybe so but this point appears likely to be punctuated with a very long pause. "
2018-02-15,EU 'removes Brexit punishment clause',https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43062112,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU diplomats have removed a so-called ""punishment clause"" from a draft text of the arrangement for the Brexit transition period, the BBC understands.A footnote published by the European Commission last week suggested that the UK would lose access to elements of the European single market if it broke EU rules during the transition period. But officials have now promised new wording that makes reference to the EU's standard infringement procedures.Brexit is scheduled for 29 March 2019.The two sides are set to begin negotiations next month on the terms of transition period after the UK's departure, which the EU has said should last until 31 December 2020.Theresa May has said a time-limited implementation period of about two years will allow businesses to adjust to changes arising from Brexit and enable the UK to negotiate its future relationship with the EU.The EU has said the UK should abide by all existing rules and regulations during the transition phase and, in text published last week, suggested there would be specific sanctions if this was not respected. This angered a number of Conservative MPs who argue the transition terms being proposed are too punitive and, in particular, the UK should not be expected to sign up to any new laws that it has not had any say over. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said that, following a meeting earlier on Wednesday, officials from the other 27 nations promised a new, less tough-sounding paragraph will feature in an expanded draft of the withdrawal agreement - expected to be published by the end of the month. Sounds like the EU27 have decided that the ""'punishment clause"" aka footnote No 4 in the draft #Brexit transition text published last week should be replaced with a less tough-sounding paragraph in the Withdawal Agreement that will refer to standard EU infringement processEnd of Twitter post  by @adamflemingThe EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said agreement on a transition is ""not a given"" since ""substantial"" disagreements remain on issues, such as freedom of movement and customs procedures on the Irish border. Speaking on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it would be ""intolerable and undemocratic"" if the UK was subject to EU laws after Brexit and was not able to determine its own regulations when it came to trading with the rest of the world. He suggested the benefits of being in the single market and customs union were ""nothing like as conspicuous or irrefutable"" as claimed by their supporters.However, Mr Johnson conceded that, during any transition period, things would ""remain as they are""."

Mr Melding was contributing to a debate on mental health in the Senedd. AMs passed a motion expressing regret ""that some people with mental health conditions face injustices and challenges when accessing services"".AM for the South Wales Central region since the beginning of devolution in 1999, Mr Melding told AMs that ""when you get through"" the attacks, ""and when you've had the treatment, the support, whatever it is, the fulfilment you feel, the well-being you feel, and the stability you feel is something beyond measure.""I think any services that get people to that better condition are to be hugely valued. They're not often very intensive."" He added: ""We're not talking about people in serious illness. Let's remember that. ""Anxiety and depression and panic attacks: they may accompany more serious illness, but people who are not seriously ill in terms of their mental health can still be prone to these things."" Mr Melding, assembly deputy presiding officer between 2011 and 2016, concluded that ""mild to moderate ill health can be very, very debilitating [and have] huge effects on the economy as well, and family life and all sorts of things.""The Conservative motion, passed by AMs on Wednesday, also calls on the Welsh Government to ""ensure that Wales's health and social care sectors are able to deliver effective, preventative mental health services"".The Welsh Government supported the motion.Health Secretary Vaughan Gething paid tribute to Mr Melding for his ""bravery for sharing his own experience, both of going through mental health challenges and being able to come out the other side and say, 'I recognise I'm in a better place now as a result.' ""He added, ""we continue to spend more on mental health services than any other part of NHS Wales,"" with nearly £650m specifically dedicated to them in the next financial year.Mr Melding was one of four assembly members who shared their experiences of mental health issues in 2012, including the now Economy Secretary Ken Skates."
2018-02-15,Steel pensions targeted by 'vultures',https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43060272,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBritish Steel pension scheme members were targeted by ""vulture"" financial advisers after Tata was allowed to offload its retirement fund, MPs say.In 2017 the Indian firm announced a restructuring of the £14bn fund to keep its UK loss-making operations afloat.But the government, Tata and regulators failed to protect 124,000 members from a ""major mis-selling scandal"", the Work and Pensions Select Committee said.The UK government has yet to issue its response to the ""neglect"" claim.The Pensions Regulator said it would continue to work to protect savers.The report from the Work and Pensions Select Committee was looking at the closure of the British Steel Pension Scheme (BSPS). Regulators had accepted that Tata Steel UK would be insolvent if it continued to sponsor the scheme.About 8,000 people are employed by Tata across England and Wales, including 3,500 in Port Talbot, but those figures were dwarfed by number of retired steelworkers - more than 100,000 - who were members of the scheme.Those members had to decide what to do with their pension funds after the scheme was separated from Tata last September.Between October and December 2017, they had a choice of entering into a new Tata-backed scheme, BSPS2, or the Pension Protection Fund (PPF).Both were less generous than the scheme that closed but BSPS2 was better for the majority of people than the PPF.A third option was transferring out of the scheme completely - a so-called DB transfer - but the committee said this is ""not usually in someone's interests"".But circumstances surrounding the BSPS ""created perfect conditions for vultures to take advantage"", the MPs concluded.One Tata worker told the BBC he lost almost £200,000 by transferring out of the BSPS after seeking independent financial advice. The committee noted that an outline plan to save Tata Steel UK, the ""sponsor"" of the BSPS, had been in place since May 2017.But it said those signatories to the deal - Tata, the UK government and Pensions Regulator - had neglected the pension scheme's members. Committee chairman Frank Field said: ""Once again we find the pensions regulator fiddling while Rome burns, when it should have seen this rip-off coming.""He added: ""All the responsible authorities must act, now, to stop more people being cheated.""The financial advisers' regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), also faces serious criticism for how it handled concerns over mis-selling.Other criticisms in the report were:Responses to the findings:The FCA said it was reviewing the rules that apply to firms advising on pension transfers.""We believe the committee's recommendations are sensible,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We are currently looking at the register to see how we can make it easier to use."" It said it remained focused on ensuring consumers are protected.The Pensions Regulator said it had fulfilled its primary role by evaluating and approving this complex restructuring of the scheme.""We believe this was the best possible outcome for everyone involved in what was a very challenging situation, bringing greater certainty for thousands of scheme members,"" said a spokesman.""We also helped tackle unscrupulous financial advisers who were exploiting the situation and the current high transfer values available by working closely with the scheme trustees, the FCA and The Pensions Advisory Service (TPAS).""Tata Steel said the consultation process was a major undertaking involving ""complex financial detail"". A spokesman said it was pleased so many pension scheme members made a positive choice to select the best scheme for their future.""We were also pleased to note the trustee expects the new scheme to pass the agreed qualifying conditions to go forward,"" he said. The BSPS trustee welcomed the work being done to ensure that members taking transfers from defined benefit pension schemes ""do so on the basis of suitable advice"". He added that the actions of some financial advisors during the process was ""something that the committee rightly highlights as a concern for all involved"".A spokesman for the steel unions, including Community, said: ""There is clear evidence from this report that some steelworkers were exploited and given poor advice on hugely important choices. ""Regulators need to toughen up when it comes to shutting down irresponsible financial advisers, and warning people about which firms to avoid.""He said they would continue to support members who believe they have been ripped off ""and will keep lobbying government and regulators to ensure measures are put in place so that such a scandal can never again be allowed to happen."""

And still no arrests? How come?""The banners were inspired by those featured in the film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.The Metropolitan Police said its investigation into the fire was ongoing and no arrests had been made.Yvette Williams, one of the organisers, said there were fears the tragedy was ""ebbing out of public consciousness"".Wednesday marked eight months since last year's 14 June fire at the 24-storey tower block, which killed 71 people.The three red and black billboards were paraded through London from 07:00 GMT on Thursday, passing by sites including the Houses of Parliament, London Bridge and St Paul's Cathedral.Ms Williams, 52, who lives in West Kensington and co-founded the Justice 4 Grenfell group, said the campaigners were approached by a creative advertising agency, which had the idea to copy the Oscar-nominated film.The movie, which stars Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, tells the story of a mother who pays for three billboards to demand answers into her daughter's unsolved murder.Ms Williams said: ""When I watched the film, one of the things that stood out for me was that it's really important to keep an issue around justice in the public eye.""We felt that it was really powerful. Over the last few weeks we felt what happened is ebbing out of the public consciousness and people are becoming desensitised.""Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick has previously said the force would do ""whatever it takes"" to bring justice to anyone who had committed a criminal offence linked to the fire.The Grenfell Tower Inquiry, chaired by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was formally opened in September last year.The second procedural hearing will take place on 21 and 22 March to review its progress."

The country Ukraine has been locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014.In the NotPetya attack, businesses with strong trade links with Ukraine, such as the UK's Reckitt Benckister, Dutch delivery firm TNT and Danish shipping giant Maersk were affected. The attack is estimated to have cost companies more than $1.2bn (£850m).Reckitt Benckiser - maker of Dettol, Durex and Strepsils - said the attack disrupted its manufacturing output and shipping capacity for up to two months. On Thursday the UK government took the unusual step of publicly accusing the Russia military of being behind the attack.""The UK and its allies will not tolerate malicious cyber activity,"" the foreign office said in a statement. Later, the White House also pointed the finger at Russia.""In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,"" a statement said.""This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber attack that will be met with international consequences.""Russia, however, said the claims were ""groundless"" and that Russian businesses were among those whose systems were affected.""It's not more than a continuation of the Russophobic campaign,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Foreign Office minister Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon said: ""The UK government judges that the Russian government, specifically the Russian military, was responsible for the destructive NotPetya cyber attack.""""Its reckless release disrupted organisations across Europe costing hundreds of millions of pounds.""We call upon Russia to be the responsible member of the international community it claims to be rather then secretly trying to undermine it.""Mr Williamson warned that the West had ""entered a new era of warfare, witnessing a destructive and deadly mix of conventional military might and malicious cyber attacks"". Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russian President Vladimir Putin in November of attempting to ""sow discord"" in the West by meddling in elections, spreading misinformation and engaging in cyber warfare."

The aim, however, must be to see all firms in the financial sector sign up to the charter and make a concerted effort to improve their gender diversity, particularly in senior roles,"" Mrs Morgan said in a letter.""Huge multinationals including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and UBS are yet to sign up to the charter, and if they don't intend to do so, the Treasury committee wants them to explain why.""The BBC understands Goldman Sachs intends to sign up.The bank said it was ""committed to promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the firm"".""It is critical that we recruit and retain a diverse group of people who bring a broad range of experiences, capabilities and perspectives to our organisation.""Our participation in the Women in Finance Charter is one element of this broader commitment,"" a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said.America's answer to the gender pay gapShared parental leave take-up may be as low as 2%Gender pay gap and equal pay: What's the difference?JP Morgan said it supported the charter's goals of the charter and it was considering signing up.

More than 160 companies with more than 600,000 employees in the financial services industry had signed up to the charter by November.About 50% of the industry's workforce is currently covered by the charter - including pledges from firms including Standard Chartered, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley International and Deutsche Bank.The Treasury said it was ""working hard"" to get more firms to sign up to the charter."

My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine.

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"
2018-02-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42966047,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim:  The cost of childcare in the UK is the highest in the world. Reality Check verdict: Yes, according to the OECD, but only when the cost of childcare is applied to a specific demographic - in this case, a relatively well-off couple. The claim that the UK has the highest childcare costs in the world was made by campaigner Joeli Brearley.Ms Brearley was referencing a study carried out by an international economic body, the OECD, which provides a snapshot of childcare costs among its 35 members.One important thing to note is that even though the OECD refers to the United Kingdom, its study only looks at childcare costs in England. That's because the other nations have different childcare policies and the OECD has not produced separate findings for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.That aside, what does the data reveal?The graph shows what it would cost to send two children (aged two and three) to a ""typical"" childcare centre (or nursery) for at least 40 hours each week.It assumes both parents are in full-time employment, where one parent earns an average wage and the second parent earns 67% of average earnings.The study also takes into account any financial support provided by governments, such as child benefit, to help towards childcare costs.On this measure, the UK (England) is clearly way out in front with the net cost of childcare working out at 55% of average earnings. This is 15 percentage points higher than New Zealand, the next most expensive country.But before drawing any firm conclusions, there are some important points to consider.Firstly, the data needs to be understood in the context of who is affected.In this example - which the claim is based on - we're looking at a relatively well-off couple. Parents on lower incomes in England may be eligible for additional support, which will reduce their childcare costs.Mike Brewer, an economics professor from the University of Essex, says that the childcare element of the working tax credit (which is being replaced by universal credit) is heavily means-tested and ""very generous to low-paid families"" relative to other countries.Under the childcare element of universal credit, parents in the UK can receive up to 85% of childcare costs.So with that in mind, what happens if the same analysis is carried out but this time it's applied to a single parent earning half the average wage?When taking this particular snapshot, England falls from being the most expensive OECD country for childcare down to eighth.  As Prof Brewer observes: ""The results in England depend heavily on what sort of family you have in mind, especially when it comes to their earnings, given that we means-test some support.""There are some other important caveats to consider.For one, the study only looks at nursery as a childcare option and not other forms, like childminders or nannies.In the UK, nurseries tend to be viewed as a premium product and more expensive than childminders.Furthermore, the data was compiled back in 2015 and doesn't reflect recent changes in childcare costs or new government policy.Since September, most working parents in England have been entitled to receive 30 hours of free childcare a week for three and four-year-olds.The Department for Education says that 202,783 children in England benefited from the policy and that families could save £5,000 per year on childcare costs.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-15,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-15,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.

Ed Balls: Small firms back customs union",https://web.archive.org//web/20180216051911/http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-43072181/ed-balls-small-firms-back-customs-union,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. There is no current example of the sort of security agreement the UK is seeking with the EU, Mrs May will say. But she will say the sort of arrangements reached with other countries in areas like trade could be replicated.""However, if the priority in the negotiations becomes avoiding any kind of new co-operation with a country outside the EU, then this political doctrine and ideology will have damaging real world consequences for the security of all our people, in the UK and the EU,"" she will say.""As leaders, we cannot let that happen.""Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work.""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said.Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like."

This is about 8% of the charity's income.The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending.In a statement, Ms Mordaunt said that following a meeting with Oxfam bosses on Monday, the charity ""has agreed to withdraw from bidding for any new UK government funding until DfID (the Department for International Development) is satisfied that they can meet the high standards we expect of our partners"".She said hundreds of ""good, brave and compassionate"" Oxfam staff had been poorly served by the leadership, adding: ""Clearly Oxfam have a long way to go before they can regain the trust of the British public, their staff and the people they aim to help.""The actions and attitude of the organisation over the coming weeks will be critical.""Ms Mordaunt said she had made three demands of Oxfam - that it makes clear how it will handle any future allegations, that staff members involved are reported to their national governments and that it cooperates with the Haitian authorities.""Oxfam has now confirmed that they have complied with all of these points,"" she said.In other developments on Friday, Oxfam International's executive director Winnie Byanyima said the charity would ""do justice"" and ""atone for the past"" by setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff.She invited victims to come forward ""for justice to be done"" for them, saying she was ""here for all the women who have been abused"". Meanwhile, Oxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, told the Guardian newspaper the scale and intensity of the criticism against his organisation was out of proportion to its level of culpability."

The review will examine how the level of fees and student debt can be balanced with the benefits of having a degree.Former education ministers Justine Greening, Lord Willetts and Charles Clarke have called for the restoration of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students and have raised concerns over the level of interest charges.Lord Adonis, another former education minister, has called for fees to be scrapped entirely.A study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the increase in fees to £9,250 and interest rates of up to 6.1% has pushed average student debt on graduation to more than £50,000.Next week a number of university leaders and representatives will face a select committee inquiry into whether higher education is delivering ""value for money"".The Labour Party has been calling for a complete scrapping of tuition fees.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We will be conducting a major review of funding across tertiary education to ensure a joined-up system that works for everyone. Further details will be set out shortly."" "

She said Sinn Féin warned the DUP to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.However, Mrs Foster has said no draft agreement was in place.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement because they were insisting on having this free-standing Irish language act,"" she said. During Mrs Bradley's walkabout on Friday, she was asked if there was a draft deal between Sinn Féin and the DUP, but she replied that she was not involved in their negotiations.On Thursday night, DUP MP Gregory Campbell rejected any suggestion that DUP party leader Arlene Foster was unable to sell a power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin to her party.Speaking to the BBC's The View programme, the DUP MP said there was no threat to Mrs Foster's leadership.Mr Campbell said: ""Arlene Foster has no difficulty within the party, didn't have any difficulty last weekend, and won't have any difficulty this weekend. ""Any nonsense that people are peddling, that calls into question Arlene Foster's leadership - you really need to get a grip,"" he added.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said there was an easy way for Sinn Féin and the DUP ""to solve the mystery of what they did agree or didn't agree"". ""Whether they called it an accommodation, a draft agreement, a heads of agreement or some other type of a deal, it's time for both parties to publish them and publish them now,"" he said. "

Three-quarters of them live with a partner, and around 60% have children.The proportion of these middle earners owning a home (27%) has moved closer to the likelihood of those with a low income (8%) than those on a high income (64%).Tom Bourlet pays £535 per month to rent a room in a flat in central Brighton.""I've been renting it for two-and-a-half years. It really is money down the drain,"" the 30-year-old says.""I don't really see much for it - it's not the biggest room.""The location is handy for work, and is close to the railway station, but Mr Bourlet would prefer to have somewhere ""to be proud of, and build up myself"", he adds.However, buying somewhere is ""completely beyond budget at the moment"".""It's absolute Mission Impossible,"" he says.""From rent, to paying for trains... all the utility bills keep shooting up. I mean, I'm nowhere near, I'm not even slightly close. I'm saving every month, but the deposit is so high that it just seems beyond reach at the moment.""Andrew Hood, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: ""Home ownership among young adults has collapsed over the past 20 years, particularly for those on middle incomes. ""The reason for this is that house prices have risen around seven times faster in real terms than the incomes of young adults over the last two decades."" Property price rises were significant in the South East of England. As a result, the region has seen the proportion of homeowners among 25 to 34-year-olds fall from 64% to 32% in two decades.Every region of Britain had seen a 10 percentage point drop over the same period, the IFS said. This will lead to some tough decisions for today's 20 to 30-somethings, according to Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money blog.""It is really hard to see how we can make this better when we are still seeing a huge demand for housing and that housing demand is not being met with the right number of houses,"" she said.""Individuals are having to decide for themselves: do I want to rent and have the flexibility but pay more for it, or do I want make a lot of difficult decisions to get on the property ladder sooner and potentially stay put for many, many years to come?""Housing minister Dominic Raab said that schemes such as Help to Buy and the removal of stamp duty for most first-time buyers had helped people to buy their first home.He also said that £45m would be invested into community projects that would help kick-start the building of thousands of new homes. John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: ""This research should be a wake-up call for Conservative ministers. After almost eight years of failure on housing, the government is still failing to tackle the fundamental problems with our broken housing market.""He said a Labour government would build 100,000 first-buy homes.

Key recommendations from the report include:An inspection in September 2017 found rats and cockroaches were rife at Liverpool Prison, with one area of the jail so dirty, infested and hazardous it could not be cleaned.Some prisoners were kept for more than 22 hours a day in cells that should be condemned, said inspectors, with exposed electrical wiring and filthy, leaking lavatories.A 2015 inspection led to 89 recommendations, but only 22 had been fully implemented two years later.There were also more than 2,000 outstanding maintenance jobs at the prison, which had its healthcare budget cut last month.The Justice Committee said national, regional and local management had all failed in their oversight of the prison.Mr Neill added: ""It is clear that HMIP require additional resources so they can make sure that their recommendations are properly acted upon.""A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Ministers have been absolutely clear that conditions at HMP Liverpool were unacceptable and we will not stand for them. ""We want to be held accountable when failings persist, which is why Ministers introduced the Urgent Notification process - demanding the Secretary of State introduce tough measures to improve failing prisons.""Head of the prison service Michael Spurr told the committee there was ""a failure at local level to follow through on the recommendations [made by HMIP in 2015]"".He added: ""I accept that from an organisational perspective we did not have enough robust governance above establishment level to make sure that [the recommendations made in 2015] were being delivered properly.""Liverpool Prison's new governor Pia Sinha told the committee she had ""initiated a deep clean of all external areas"" and had increased the number of prisoners cleaning."

The government has encouraged councils and bus companies to work together to halt the decline.One lobbying group fears the scale of the miles lost are a sign buses are on course to be cut to the same extent railways were in the 1960s.During that decade thousands of miles of track were scrapped and hundreds of stations closed following a report by British Railways Board chairman Dr Richard Beeching.Chris Todd, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""We are not talking a loss of that level, but we are heading that way.""We live in a society that is quite prepared to completely abandon certain groups of people and leave them with no options of getting around.""Communities around the UK say the shrinking bus network is leaving people unable to reach basic services such as shops and GP surgeries.In Chard in Somerset, mother Melissa Whittaker told the BBC how a 10-mile journey to take her autistic son Issac to their nearest community hospital can take three hours, the same time it would take to walk.Villagers in Ditton Priors, Shropshire, who have not had a regular bus service since 2012, say some elderly residents have been forced to move away.And some cut-off communities have even gone as far as setting up their own replacement bus services.Cumbria's Western Dales Bus company runs its routes with the help of 20 volunteer drivers.One of its directors, John Carey, said the National Lottery-funded company was a lifeline for hundreds in the county.He said: ""Without this people would have been cut off, absolutely.""They wouldn't have been able to go to the shops. It has preserved the mobility of elderly residents in the area.""Although car use is at an all-time high, buses remain Britain's most popular form of public transport.But analysis of official statistics by the BBC Shared Data Unit found the UK's bus network has shrunk by 8% in the last decade. That equates to 134 million fewer miles - the equivalent of more than 5,000 trips around the equator.Passenger numbers have increased marginally (0.7%) over the same period.There are a number of reasons why Britain's bus network is shrinking in size, according to John Disney, a transport researcher and lecturer at Nottingham Business School.He said: ""Commercial operators have definitely, over the last 10 years, become much more risk-averse and so they are really concentrating on what they consider to be their core routes and are not really bothered about much else.""He said at the same time many local authorities, which would have stepped up to subsidise unprofitable routes, have reduced this spending.But the trade body for operators, the Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), denied the claim that companies were becoming risk-averse.A spokeswoman said: ""Where routes become unviable, sound business decisions need to be taken and there are many examples of operators continuing to operate lightly used and uneconomic services, or developing innovative ways of meeting passengers' needs.""In England, the scale of the bus network has fallen to levels last seen in 1991, even though passenger numbers are now 8% higher than they were then.The figures show big regional variations, with the North West the worst-hit, losing nearly a quarter (23%) of miles from its network in a decade.London, the East of England and the South East, on the other hand, were the only English regions to see bus mileage increase over the past decade.The capital now accounts for a quarter of all bus miles travelled in England, the highest proportion since this measurement began in 1982.This has prompted campaigners to describe England's public transport system as ""two-tier"".Outside the capital, England's metropolitan areas were hardest hit, which experts believe is linked to increasing congestion. The bus coverage in metropolitan areas has dropped by a tenth since 2013-14 alone, figures show, while rural areas saw bus routes cut by 7.8%.Wales has seen the biggest drop in bus coverage over the past decade.Annual bus mileage fell by a fifth between 2006-07 and 2016-17, a loss of 15 million miles.Experts suggest the slump in Wales could be down to a succession of bus companies going into administration in recent years.A spokesman for the Welsh government said the figures do not reflect growth on some local services and the longer distance TrawsCymru network of buses.Scotland's network shrank by 15% over the past decade.The Scottish region hit hardest was South West and Strathclyde, which saw bus mileage fall by more than a fifth in 10 years.Only one Scottish region saw bus mileage increase: North East, Tayside and Central, which covers Dundee and Aberdeen.Northern Ireland's bus network is publicly-run. It covers 6.4% fewer miles a year than it did ten years ago, a loss of 2.6 million miles.Most of Britain's bus network is provided by commercial companies, although local government can subsidise routes which are deemed unprofitable but socially important.Many campaigners say the shrinking pot of funding available for these subsidies is a major contributor to the decline of Britain's buses.However, the BBC's analysis shows subsidy cuts are only part of the picture.Excluding London, all English regions have seen bus subsidies reduced in the past four years, losing a third (32%) of their subsidised miles on average.But at the same time, bus companies have also been reducing the number of commercially-run miles in the North, while increasing them in the South, the analysis shows.In Brighton and Hove, for instance, its bus network appears to be thriving, despite only 3% of miles now being paid for by the council.Some areas have seen public sector investment pay off.In Nottingham, which has the third highest bus use per head of population in England, passengers can travel with a range of different companies using a Robin Hood card.But the authority there also spends more on buses each year than the whole of Tyne and Wear, which has four times the population.The Local Government Association has said councils could do more to prop up transport routes if they had more Whitehall funding.Its transport spokesman Chris Tett said the shrinking of Britain's bus network was ""hugely concerning"".The government has given English 'metro mayors' new powers to set up Transport for London-style bus franchise systems.It means they could set the routes and timetables for their areas and invite companies to bid to run them.The Bus Services Act 2017 also aims to get local authorities and bus companies in other areas of England to work in partnership to improve services.A spokeswoman for the Department for Transport said: ""Buses connect people, homes and businesses, and that's why we have given councils extra powers to work in partnership with bus companies to improve the service passengers expect and deserve.""The Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.

Ms McDonald said the agreement included an Irish language Act and the DUP was warned to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.However, DUP leader Arlene Foster said that no draft agreement was in place.Mrs Foster told Sky News that Sinn Féin ""certainly didn't have an offer of an Irish language act"".""We didn't reach an agreement,"" she said.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement - they were insisting that they have this stand-alone Irish language act and that is not something I could sign up to - I have always been very clear about that.""The Prime Minister spoke to the leaders of both Sinn Féin and the DUP on Thursday evening.A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said Mrs May ""expressed her disappointment"" that an agreement had not been reached.""The Prime Minister was clear that she still believes the basis for an agreement exists, and urged them both to reflect on the recent phase of talks in order to find the best way forward"".Sinn Féin and the DUP had been in negotiations in a bid to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont.Mrs Foster dismissed claims that she had lost control of her party as ""nonsense"" and said that she had kept her party officers briefed throughout the negotiations.""We have had a number of meetings so I could bring them up to date as to where we are at, but I have never felt that I am in a position that I can make a recommendation and so no recommendation has been made to my officer board,"" she said.Mrs Foster told RTÉ that a ""completely different set of circumstances"" existed in Northern Ireland than in Scotland or Wales, because ""in those places language has not been used as a political demand and that needs to be recognised.""They need to recognise that the majority of people here do not want an Irish language act a la Wales,"" she said.Ms McDonald claimed a draft package in place last week included an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act, and respecting language and diversity act.""The Irish language act included provision for official recognition of Irish, the creation of an Irish language commissioner, the repeal of the ban on Irish in the courts was also to be legislated for,"" the Sinn Féin leader said.""It did not involve at any stage making Irish compulsory or applying quotas to public services. This was not a consideration,"" she added.Ms McDonald said there had been ""no meetings of mind on marriage equality"", but it was agreed that it would be considered in the assembly in the form of a private member's bill.The Sinn Féin leader said the DUP must now explain their position.""The DUP leader brought this phase of negotiations to a close and said 'there is no current prospect of these discussions leading to an Executive being formed',"" she said.""It is up to Arlene Foster to explain this given that the DUP and Sinn Féin leaderships had achieved an accommodation across the issues involved."""

2018-02-16,"Should everybody get £10,000?",https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43078920,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government should give £10,000 to every citizen under 55, a report suggests.The Royal Society for the encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) said it could pave the way to everyone getting a basic state wage.The idea sees two payments of £5,000 paid over two years, but certain state benefits and tax reliefs would be removed at the same time.The RSA said it would compensate workers for the way jobs are changing. The money would help to steer UK citizens through the 2020s, ""as automation replaces many jobs, climate change hits and more people face balancing employment with social care"", the report said.Payments would come from a British sovereign wealth fund in the form of two annual £5,000 dividends, the RSA proposes.The payments would not be means tested, and applicants would only have to demonstrate how they intended to use the money.Anthony Painter, director of the RSA's Action and Research Centre, said: ""The simple fact is that too many households are highly vulnerable to a shock in a decade of disruption, with storm clouds on the horizon if automation, Brexit and an ageing population are mismanaged.""Without a real change in our thinking, neither tweaks to the welfare state nor getting people into work alone, when the link between hard work and fair pay has broken, will help working people meet the challenges ahead.""A Government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to have a welfare system that supports those who work and cares for those who can't, while being fair to the taxpayer. ""Providing a universal basic income would not allow for the same targeted support that is tailored to meet individual needs.""But the RSA The report says the fund could help people: ""A low-skilled worker might reduce their working hours to attain skills enabling career progression.""The fund could provide the impetus to turn an entrepreneurial idea into a reality. It could be the support that enables a carer to be there for a loved one.""The fund would be built from public debt, levies on untaxed corporate assets and investments in long term infrastructure projects, and be similar to Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.As the dividends would replace payments such as Child Benefit, Tax Credits and Jobseeker's Allowance, the savings for the government could also be ploughed into the fund.Anyone receiving the ""dividends"" would not be able to claim any tax allowances, which the RSA says would act as a disincentive to wealthier earners wanting to apply for the handout.In all, the RSA puts the cost of the scheme at £14.5bn a year if it is fully subscribed to, and a total of £462bn over 13 years, more than half of which would be paid for by government savings. The Labour Party has said it is looking into similar arguments for a Universal Basic Income (UBI).Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour's shadow Treasury minister, said: ""This new report from the RSA raises the right questions about the future of work and the long-term challenges we face, including making sure automation and the changing nature of work deliver a fairer, more prosperous society."" Scotland is considering piloting UBI schemes in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and North Ayrshire.The RSA report suggests that options for funding a full UBI included a tax on wealth, levies on companies' assets, and a tax on tech firms - such as Amazon, Facebook and Apple - using or transferring people's data.The history of UBI can be dated back to Thomas Paine's essay, Agrarian Justice, where he proposes the idea as part of a social security system.More recently the idea has been put into practice in limited ways. For instance, in Alaska all residents have been entitled since 1982 to a yearly cash dividend from the Alaska Permanent Fund. Finland is half way through a two year nationwide pilot scheme, giving 2,000 unemployed Finns a monthly income of €560 (£497) which continues even if they find work. Scotland has provided funding for four local authorities to look into the idea.In the US one Democrat presidential nominee hopeful, Andrew Yang is proposing his version of UBI, a $1,000 a month ""Freedom Dividend"".Even so, some economists believe full UBI can't work.Brexit campaigner Patrick Minford from Cardiff University's Business School said UBI is ""not a workable scheme because it's far too expensive"".""It creates a tremendous tax, a disincentive for the average person further up the income scale who's paying for it all.""There are questions over how much of a social security system UBI would replace.Would citizens still be able to claim disability allowance or help with housing?The RSA believes that properly done UBI would help people get into work, give them an opportunity to rethink their lives and contribute to better health and wellbeing. Others claim it would be a disincentive. However, a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research into the Alaska Permanent Fund concluded that ""it does not significantly decrease aggregate employment"".A report by the OECD into UBI said that its effect would be hugely different depending on the circumstances of each individual and the existing tax and benefits systems.UBI could also be ruinously expensive for governments and provide limited benefit for the poor, it said. According to the OECD report, if the UK were to fund UBI only with money saved by abolishing the existing benefits system it would lead to higher levels of poverty.It adds: ""However, even in the case where taxes are raised significantly to pay for [UBI] it does not significantly reduce poverty."""
2018-02-16,Council may feed children 365 days a year,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-43078340,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Scottish council is planning to provide free meals 365 days a year to children from low income families.North Lanarkshire Council said its proposal would help tackle ""holiday hunger"".The ""Food 365"" programme would cover the 175 days of the year when lunches are not served in school.If approved, the council will run a pilot project in the spring break and could then extend the scheme over the summer holidays.Frank McNally, convener of education, said: ""These proposals to tackle weekend and holiday hunger are the most ambitious in the country.""Groups like the Trussell Trust are struggling to cope with demand from parents and research has suggested that pressure on food banks doubles during the holidays.""North Lanarkshire has one of the highest concentrations of deprivation in the country and this is only going to be exacerbated by further welfare reforms.""The council cited national research which suggests that almost a third of parents with incomes under £25,000 skip meals during the school holidays so that their children can eat, and nearly two thirds are not always able to afford food outside of term time.This rises to half and three-quarters respectively for parents with incomes under £15,000.In a survey carried out by the National Union of Teachers in England, 80% of teachers noted a rise in ""holiday hunger"" where children return from holidays suffering from poor nutrition.Almost three-quarters of teachers said this was negatively affecting children's education.While some councils in the UK have committed to holiday programmes, these do not include weekends. North Lanarkshire Council said its scheme would be the most comprehensive in the country.Mr McNally continued: ""A good diet plays a key role in healthy growth and development, supporting learning and social skills and sets a positive habit to be continued later in life.""Our plans will do much to promote healthy eating and address some of the symptoms of poverty for children who need it most.""John Dickie of the Child Poverty Action Group warmly welcomed the proposal.But he warned it was vital to provide the meals in such a way that there was no risk of children or their families feeling stigmatised.He said: ""I haven't seen the detail of this proposal but in general terms we would welcome extension of free school meals but also stress that's it's really important that healthy free holiday lunches are offered as part of a wider package of holiday activities""Every effort should be made to avoid the risk of stigmatising holiday provision, for example by making sure it is open to those who pay for school lunches too and isn't promoted purely as a feeding programme.""The local SNP group welcomed the proposal but said the council should not axe school breakfast clubs.SNP's education spokesman Councillor Tom Johnston said: ""I am delighted that this council has finally agreed with our position that children shouldn't go hungry simply because the schools are closed for holidays.""He said SNP proposals to introduce the policy in 2003 had been blocked by the Labour administration.""The SNP will support this proposal but we will amend it to go further and reverse the Labour decision to cut breakfast clubs from this summer,"" he added.""Our proposal will commit this council not only to continuing breakfast clubs, but extending them from August to cover every primary school in North Lanarkshire.""The Scottish government said tackling poverty and inequality was a ""key priority"". A spokesman added: ""Our £1m a year Fair Food Fund supports projects which promote sustainable solutions to food poverty. ""In addition, local authorities also have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs.""Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP said: ""Delivering free school meals for low income families for every day of the year may be a noble objective but it is undoubtedly expensive if each child is to have a nutritious meal.""Hopefully the council has carefully considered all its options and explained to parents how it will be paying for this service.""North Lanarkshire is one of the nine ""challenge authorities"" in Scotland with the highest levels of deprivation. Nearly 21% of children live in low income households. If the pilot is successful, the programme would be delivered in 23 ""hubs"" across the authority area, usually in community facilities. Based on demand for other previous holiday initiatives, the cost is estimated to be £500,000.The proposals will be discussed by councillors at a meeting of the education committee on 20 February."

My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy.

What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay.

2018-02-16,Behind the famous door,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-43063979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrantic, frightening but ""terrific fun"" is how Robert Armstrong looks back at his time as the UK's most powerful civil servant. He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

2018-02-16,Day of reckoning?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43031541,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe starting pistol for the review of university tuition fees in England will be fired early next week.Or at least that's the latest claim in the political twisting and turning over one of the toughest domestic decisions facing a fragile government.The last time Theresa May's review of fees seemed to be approaching, neither the education secretary Justine Greening nor the universities minister Jo Johnson seemed particularly enthusiastic - and within weeks both of them were out of their jobs. The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"
2018-02-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals - click here to see the current sticking points.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. if all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that has become used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. Like Mr Cameron, Mrs May was against Britain leaving the EU but she played only a very low-key role in the campaign and was never seen as much of an enthusiast for the EU. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.But predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 7% in the year to October 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams meet face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing a ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour's position on Brexit was tweaked in mid-August, when the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, announced that the party now wanted to keep the UK in the single market and a customs union during a transition that could last for up to four years.Labour would also accept free movement of people, payments into the EU budget and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the transition. This is a considerably ""softer"" version of Brexit than the one advocated by the government, but there are still divisions within the party about whether the UK should try to stay in the single market in the longer term.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-16,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180216224346/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Following the vote, Mr Bolton, who had been in the job for less than five months, said he feared the result would see UKIP ""taken off the battlefield"" of British politics for months.He said: ""I think it's going to be difficult to unite the party, what we have effectively had is a rejection of a new draft constitution, a reorganisation and indeed a new way of doing politics.""Mr Bolton again said he had ""strong affections"" for his former girlfriend, who he said sent him a good luck text message before the meeting.Asked if he was going to get back together with Ms Marney, he said: ""I have said all along that once we got the EGM out of the way I would spend time sorting out my private life.""He was elected in September in the wake of UKIP's disastrous performance in last year's general election.The party's national executive committee expressed no confidence in him last month, triggering the ballot. He lost the no confidence motion by 867 votes to 500.Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden said: ""Henry Bolton has been removed by the democratic decision of the membership.""The members ballotting pic.twitter.com/qn0KffwKbaEnd of Twitter post  by @UKIPMr Bolton was the party's fourth leader in 18 months.He had replaced Paul Nuttall, who quit after the general election - which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015.When Henry Bolton was elected just five months ago, many in UKIP had hoped he'd be the unifying force the party needed, bringing its focus back to Brexit. But like his two predecessors, his tenure was short lived, and now UKIP is once again seeking leadership and direction. The party's most senior figures are optimistic that they can find a strong leader who will rally the members and give UKIP a voice in the Brexit debate. But among some activists who attended the emergency meeting there was frustration, even anger, at the continued turmoil at the top.Some fear another divisive contest - not least because of the financial implications for the cash-strapped party. UKIP might survive - most think it will - but for now some don't see how it can regain its place on the political playing field as the influential force it once was. Mr Batten, London MEP, said UKIP's membership had made the right decision to sack Mr Bolton.The interim leader said: ""I believe that you have made the best decision that you could in the circumstances.""Mr Bolton said he was considering legal action as a result of the way the process to get rid of him was handled, but Mr Batten responded by saying: ""Get on with the rest of your life.""Prior to the vote ex-leader Nigel Farage had backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance""."
2018-02-17,MPs want Brexit fund for UK farmers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180218053020/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43088855,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs scrutinising the government's plans for the agriculture industry after Brexit want funding for farmers when EU subsidies end, they said in a report.Without an EU-UK trade deal, farm exports face tariffs from March 2019.UK shoppers would also likely see price rises from EU imports such as Danish pork and French cheese, the MPs found.However the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it could both ""secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting farmers"".The environment secretary Michael Gove told farmers in January the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level only until the 2022 election.The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee assessed the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) levels of tariffs and regulations being applied to UK-EU food trade, if no deal came out of Brexit negotiations. It today published its report, Brexit: Trade in Food. The report acknowledges the Government's intention to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement and customs agreement with the EU, but says ""there is no guarantee that this will occur.""""In the event that the UK leaves the EU without a free-trade agreement, UK-EU trade will proceed under WTO rules. Reverting to WTO tariffs will have a significant impact upon agriculture as tariffs are higher for agricultural products than for other goods and services,"" the report states.UK exports would become less competitive in EU markets if WTO rules applied. MPs on the committee suggested the switch from the single market to potential import and export tariffs on food between the UK and EU 27 could force the government to offer funding to farmers as they adjust.The report says ""Defra should consider providing a fund to support our food producing industry to adapt effectively to the challenge ahead.""The National Farmers Union (NFU) echoed the report's findings and its chief EU exit adviser Gail Soutar said there would be ""significant impact on Britain's farmers and domestic food supply"" if no deal was reached.The committee said the sheep farming industry could in particular be worse-off if the EU slapped WTO tariffs on UK lamb.The MPs on the committee heard ""the EU is very important for UK sheep meat exports, with more than 95% of its export volume destined for the EU.""The report said if sheep meat exports defaulted on to the usual tariff, which would increase their prices by 50%, they would become uncompetitive on the EU market.British shoppers would also see prices rise at the supermarket, if this import tax pushed up production costs for food made here or if the UK government slapped tariffs on food imports from the EU.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said the committee's report highlighted the cost of a no-deal outcome for farmers, food producers and shoppers across the UK.""If the UK leaves the EU with no trade agreement, the average WTO tariff of 22% that would be applied to imports, would increase prices for consumers... this would be an unappetising hit to their weekly food bills. ""Given that over two thirds of our food that is imported comes from the EU to supplement UK production, the scale of this potential impact is clear.""Ms Dickinson said that the UK government should not simply cut all tariffs on imported food to help consumers out.""The answer does not lie in unilaterally dropping tariffs to zero, due to the devastating consequences this would have for the UK's agricultural industry.""The committee's report said such a reaction would ""put many UK farmers out of business and render the UK dependent on imported food"".The NFU also warned against the country lowering tariffs across the board, which would open the UK market up to more, potentially cheaper, food imports.The industry is concerned cheaper imports will be available because of lower environmental and animal welfare standards in the countries they are produced - and that the UK's import rules may be softened in order to sign trade deals.However a Defra spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting our farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food.  ""Any future [EU-UK] deal must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers, and we will not compromise on our high environmental or welfare standards."" The agriculture industry employs one in eight people in the UK.Farm and food production is worth around £110bn per year and the EU is both the largest recipient of British farm produce and the largest exporter of such goods into the UK."

""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks.A spokesman for the Department for Education said the ""major review"" would examine ""funding across tertiary education to ensure a joined-up system that works for everyone""."

""We murdered babies in their cots?"" Mr Goldring also suggested that critics are motivated by an anti-aid agenda.The charity boss said that ""anything we say is being manipulated... even apologies only make matters worse.""He acknowledged Oxfam could have acted faster but said ""what I felt really clearly is many people haven't wanted to listen to explanations"".Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country director hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam.The charity faced more criticism when it emerged that it had not shared details of the allegations with the Haitian government.Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in today's Guardian in which it says sorry to the people of Haiti and the charity's supporters. The ad, paid for by supporters rather than the charity, also sets out the actions the organisation plans to take, including tripling Oxfam's safeguarding capacity and establishing a review into improving its culture.Another charity - Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - has now come under question as the president of Haiti called for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country.Jovenel Moise, asked why the medical charity MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members.He told the Reuters news agency:  ""The Oxfam case is the visible part of the iceberg,""It is not only Oxfam, there are other NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the same situation, but they hide the information internally.""MSF said it took reports of staff misconduct seriously and was seeking to clarify questions raised by the president.Oxfam has agreed to stop bidding for UK government funding until it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had ""a long way to go"" before regaining the trust of the public, its staff and the people it aims to help.The charity, which had a total income of £409m last year, received £31.7m from the government in 2016, accounting for about 8% of the charity's income.The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending.Oxfam is setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff.Other planned reforms include new funding for safeguarding measures and a crackdown on references issued to former staff.Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

She said Sinn Féin warned the DUP to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.However, Mrs Foster has said no draft agreement was in place.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement because they were insisting on having this free-standing Irish language act,"" she said. During Mrs Bradley's walkabout on Friday, she was asked if there was a draft deal between Sinn Féin and the DUP, but she replied that she was not involved in their negotiations.On Thursday night, DUP MP Gregory Campbell rejected any suggestion that DUP party leader Arlene Foster was unable to sell a power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin to her party.Speaking to the BBC's The View programme, the DUP MP said there was no threat to Mrs Foster's leadership.Mr Campbell said: ""Arlene Foster has no difficulty within the party, didn't have any difficulty last weekend, and won't have any difficulty this weekend. ""Any nonsense that people are peddling, that calls into question Arlene Foster's leadership - you really need to get a grip,"" he added.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said there was an easy way for Sinn Féin and the DUP ""to solve the mystery of what they did agree or didn't agree"". ""Whether they called it an accommodation, a draft agreement, a heads of agreement or some other type of a deal, it's time for both parties to publish them and publish them now,"" he said. "
2018-02-17,May urges new EU security deal by 2019,https://web.archive.org//web/20180218053020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43088246,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU.New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit.Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly.  To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space.The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added.She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"".President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues.""Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations.The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"".EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects.The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"".In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders.The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed.""The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on.""Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security.  Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work.""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said.Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like."
2018-02-17,Lecturers want 'radical' fee review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180218053020/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43075768,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUniversity staff are calling for a ""radical"" overhaul of tuition fees and higher education funding in England in a review of student finance.Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, says the review must be more than ""tinkering at the edges"".The review, to be formally announced in the next few days, follows a promise by the prime minister to examine the cost of university.Theresa May said the review would show ""we have listened and we have learned"".Ms Hunt, whose members are threatening strike action next week in a pensions dispute, says there needs to be a ""fundamental look at university funding"".""Too often recent reviews have simply resulted in finding new ways to saddle students with record levels of debt,"" said Ms Hunt.The system of student fees and loans should be based on an assumption that ""higher education is a public good,"" she said.The fees review, expected to be announced by the prime minister and Education Secretary Damian Hinds, will consider cutting or freezing £9,250 fees and lowering interest rates of up to 6.1% for repayments.There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages.But universities are concerned about a loss of funding - and Ms Hunt said that businesses should be asked to make a ""fairer contribution"" to the cost of higher education.The Russell Group of leading universities has warned that any changes to fees and funding should not mean a limit on places.""Finding the right balance is likely to involve making a series of difficult trade-offs,"" said a spokesman for the university group.The Russell Group said that the funding model that emerges from the review needs to give universities a ""predictable and sustainable"" income - as well as fees that reflect the benefits to students from having a degree.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said he was concerned the review would focus too much on tuition fees and not ""spend enough time on things like part-time funding and students' cost of living"". The review will examine how the level of fees and student debt can be balanced with the benefits of having a degree.Former education ministers Justine Greening, Lord Willetts and Charles Clarke have called for the restoration of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students and have raised concerns over the level of interest charges.Lord Adonis, another former education minister, has called for fees to be scrapped entirely.A study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that the increase in fees to £9,250 and interest rates of up to 6.1% has pushed average student debt on graduation to more than £50,000.Next week a number of university leaders and representatives will face a select committee inquiry into whether higher education is delivering ""value for money"".The Labour Party has been calling for a complete scrapping of tuition fees.A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We will be conducting a major review of funding across tertiary education to ensure a joined-up system that works for everyone. Further details will be set out shortly."" "

Three-quarters of them live with a partner, and around 60% have children.The proportion of these middle earners owning a home (27%) has moved closer to the likelihood of those with a low income (8%) than those on a high income (64%).Tom Bourlet pays £535 per month to rent a room in a flat in central Brighton.""I've been renting it for two-and-a-half years. It really is money down the drain,"" the 30-year-old says.""I don't really see much for it - it's not the biggest room.""The location is handy for work, and is close to the railway station, but Mr Bourlet would prefer to have somewhere ""to be proud of, and build up myself"", he adds.However, buying somewhere is ""completely beyond budget at the moment"".""It's absolute Mission Impossible,"" he says.""From rent, to paying for trains... all the utility bills keep shooting up. I mean, I'm nowhere near, I'm not even slightly close. I'm saving every month, but the deposit is so high that it just seems beyond reach at the moment.""Andrew Hood, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: ""Home ownership among young adults has collapsed over the past 20 years, particularly for those on middle incomes. ""The reason for this is that house prices have risen around seven times faster in real terms than the incomes of young adults over the last two decades."" Property price rises were significant in the South East of England. As a result, the region has seen the proportion of homeowners among 25 to 34-year-olds fall from 64% to 32% in two decades.Every region of Britain had seen a 10 percentage point drop over the same period, the IFS said. This will lead to some tough decisions for today's 20 to 30-somethings, according to Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money blog.""It is really hard to see how we can make this better when we are still seeing a huge demand for housing and that housing demand is not being met with the right number of houses,"" she said.""Individuals are having to decide for themselves: do I want to rent and have the flexibility but pay more for it, or do I want make a lot of difficult decisions to get on the property ladder sooner and potentially stay put for many, many years to come?""Housing minister Dominic Raab said that schemes such as Help to Buy and the removal of stamp duty for most first-time buyers had helped people to buy their first home.He also said that £45m would be invested into community projects that would help kick-start the building of thousands of new homes. John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said: ""This research should be a wake-up call for Conservative ministers. After almost eight years of failure on housing, the government is still failing to tackle the fundamental problems with our broken housing market.""He said a Labour government would build 100,000 first-buy homes.

I think I'm a little bit in danger of becoming a gay icon!""Barbara Hosking has come out at the age of 91, as she reflects on a remarkable life in the corridors of power.As a senior civil servant she worked for two prime ministers, Edward Heath and Harold Wilson, as well as a television executive.She battled sexism throughout her career, fighting for equal pay and even to be in the room during some meetings.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett Show she explained why she never told her family about her sexuality.""My parents wouldn't have understood and they would have been shocked.""They loved me very much, but my father was very old-fashioned and conventional. My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine. ""I drink claret. Two glasses a day. My doctor knows it and says it's OK!""You can hear the full interview with Barbara Hosking on the Emma Barnett Show on BBC 5 live at 12.30 on Wednesday 14 February."

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"
2018-02-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180218053020/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-18,Minister calls for tuition fee 'variety',https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43075769,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMore ""variety"" is needed in the price of university education, the secretary of state said ahead of a government review of the system.Damian Hinds also suggested tuition fees should reflect each degree's value ""to our society as a whole"".It comes as a committee of MPs said there was no justification for such ""high interest rates"" on student loans.Labour said another review would not solve the problems posed by interest rate increases and fee rises.The review, to be launched by Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday, will consider cutting or freezing £9,250 tuition fees and lowering interest rates to reduce levels of graduate debt.There will also be discussion of funding for vocational courses and apprenticeships to tackle skills shortages.Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Hinds would not go into specifics about the review, which he said would be carried out by an independent panel.He defended the current system - under which students begin to repay fees when they earn over £21,000, rising to £25,000.But he said that when it was devised, ministers had not expected so many courses to be charging the same fee.""What we need to look at is the different aspects of pricing - the cost that it is to put on the course, the value that it is to the student and also the value to our society as a whole and to our economy for the future,"" he said.He said politicians would not be setting the price of different courses, but added: ""What we are doing in the review is looking at how that system works, making sure there are alternatives, making sure there is more variety.""This could include cheaper ways of delivering university education like shorter courses and part-time study, he said.Mr Hinds' predecessor as education secretary, Conservative MP Justine Greening, said student finance should not be a ""political football"" and warned against the issue being ""kicked into the long grass"" with a review.She predicted the review would face a ""challenge"" in trying to work out which degrees were most beneficial to the country.Labour's education spokeswoman Angela Rayner said the government had announced three reviews of tuition fees in 12 months and that another one would not ""solve the problem of the hike in interest rates which this government has done and the tripling of tuition fees"".BBC education correspondent Sean CoughlanThis might have been heralded as taking an axe to tuition fees, but in practice it sounds more like prudent pruning. Damian Hinds has signalled that university fees and student debts in England are much higher than anyone really expected when the current system was introduced in 2012. The forthcoming review will look for ways to push down the cost - such as lowering interest rates, restoring maintenance grants or reducing fees for some courses. The most definite impact for students is that tuition fees are not going above £9,250 any time soon, and the freeze on fees could continue indefinitely.But there is no sign of any radical cutting of the headline figure for fees or pressure for a fundamentally different system. And Mr Hinds seemed to play down suggestions of any intervention from ministers to set different fee levels for sciences, arts and humanities. On schools, Mr Hinds has positioned himself as a pragmatic traditionalist. He's supportive of grammar schools - but there are no plans for any new grammars to be opened.And he will revive the prime minister's stalled plan to allow more free schools to be set up by faith groups.According to the Treasury select committee, the review should reconsider the level of interest rates and whether these charges should be applied when students are still studying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown that students in England will run up more than £5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university.Former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have all raised concerns about the level of interest charges.There is also a call to consider reinstating maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, after these were abolished last year.Committee chairwoman Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary, warned that the maintenance loans available to students were not enough to cover all their living costs.""If a student can't access additional sources of income, they may be priced out of university,"" said the committee chairman.The MPs are also asking for a clearer explanation of why such a high level of tuition fee is necessary.The review of fees, first promised in the autumn by the prime minister, will examine whether students are paying a fair amount, whether it is the most efficient way of funding universities and whether students are getting value for money when they are graduating with an average of £50,000 in debt.It will also consider the funding of the broader post-18 education system and whether students not on three-year degree courses are getting enough support.Part-time student numbers fell sharply after the last fees increase - and the Treasury Select Committee has called on the review to find ways to reverse this.Peter Horrocks, vice-chancellor of the Open University, said the committee of MPs ""rightly recognised that part-time students have been the real victims of the 2012 reforms"". ""The collapse in part-time student numbers in England is undermining attempts to tackle the skills crisis in the economy,"" said Mr Horrocks."

There have been many stories of rural land owners effectively holding operators to ransom for access to some sites, which has slowed down rollout and added considerably to the cost.""The government said commercial arrangements would be made locally between dioceses or parishes and mobile operators and broadband providers but gave no further details.Two-thirds of Anglican churches are in rural areas and their location at the heart of their communities means they are well-placed to help deliver improved mobile connectivity, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said.Secretary of State Matt Hancock said: ""Churches are central features and valued assets for local communities up and down the country. ""This agreement with the Church of England will mean that even a 15th Century building can help make Britain fit for the future, improving people's lives by boosting connectivity in some of our hardest-to-reach areas."" There are already about 120 examples of broadband and mobile services being delivered from parish churches across the country, according to the Church of England.These take a variety of forms - from wireless transmitters in spires to aerials, satellite dishes and cables. The equipment is used to boost both voice and data coverage.The Dioceses of Norwich and Chelmsford have been signed up to programmes for at least five years. The Bishop of Chelmsford, the Right Reverend Stephen Cottrell, said: ""Encouraging churches to improve connectivity will help tackle two of the biggest issues rural areas face - isolation and sustainability.""Our work has significantly improved rural access to high-speed broadband.""The Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham James, said using parish churches ""creatively"" would enhance their value to communities.According to Ofcom's figures, published in December, 4G coverage - where a signal is available from all four mobile operators - is currently available across 43% of the UK. For calls and text messaging, 70% of the UK can receive a signal from all four operators.At the time, Lord Adonis, the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission, urged Ofcom to improve mobile service, which he described as ""deplorable""."
2018-02-18,Davidson defends foreign aid commitment,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-43104143,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDefending the UK's foreign aid budget has been made harder by the Oxfam scandal, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said.In an interview on Peston on Sunday, she condemned charity workers who exploited the vulnerable people they were supposed to be helping. And she criticised the ""arrogant"" response of Oxfam's chief executive.But she said it was important that people understood how UK foreign aid benefits people around the world. The UK government is committed to spending 0.7% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on foreign aid. That amounted to £13.3bn in 2016, according to the Department for International Development. However, earlier this month a petition was delivered to Downing Street by Jacob Rees-Mogg calling for the foreign aid budget to be cut. It coincided with revelations that some Oxfam aid workers in Haiti used prostitutes, following the huge earthquake which killed more than 200,000 people in 2010. The charity has been accused of covering up the behaviour of their former employees by failing to reveal the full extent of the allegations at the time. In an interview by Robert Peston, Ms Davidson said it was important that people did not ignore ""all the good"" done with the help of UK foreign aid. She pointed to funding of child vaccination programmes, mine clearance operations and the education of women. She said: ""We can't ignore all the good that aid does, and I know that the 0.7% debate is a big debate.""I think (those who support UK aid) have all got a bigger job to do to explain what it actually is that British aid does around the world, and I think what Oxfam has done has just made that job 100% harder.""The MSP for Edinburgh Central added: ""The idea that international helpers that go to a country that has had a terrible disaster like Haiti and use their position, which is to help the most vulnerable, to then exploit them is probably pretty much the lowest circle of hell that you can find. ""The idea that instead of addressing that behaviour, instead of reporting it, instead of allowing the authorities in the country to deal with it, instead of allowing victims of that behaviour to see justice being done, the idea is that we'll protect the reputation of what we've built up ourselves. ""I think that's what's really hurt people at the centre of this affair. ""She gave the interview after returning from a trip to Afghanistan with Scottish charity, The Halo Trust, which is running a mine clearance operation in the country. The Halo Trust suspended a Burmese employee in January pending an investigation into an allegation of sexual assault. "

Following the vote, Mr Bolton, who had been in the job for less than five months, said he feared the result would see UKIP ""taken off the battlefield"" of British politics for months.He said: ""I think it's going to be difficult to unite the party, what we have effectively had is a rejection of a new draft constitution, a reorganisation and indeed a new way of doing politics.""Mr Bolton again said he had ""strong affections"" for his former girlfriend, who he said sent him a good luck text message before the meeting.Asked if he was going to get back together with Ms Marney, he said: ""I have said all along that once we got the EGM out of the way I would spend time sorting out my private life.""He was elected in September in the wake of UKIP's disastrous performance in last year's general election.The party's national executive committee expressed no confidence in him last month, triggering the ballot. He lost the no confidence motion by 867 votes to 500.Outgoing chairman Paul Oakden said: ""Henry Bolton has been removed by the democratic decision of the membership.""The members ballotting pic.twitter.com/qn0KffwKbaEnd of Twitter post  by @UKIPMr Bolton was the party's fourth leader in 18 months.He had replaced Paul Nuttall, who quit after the general election - which saw UKIP's vote share shrink to 1.8% from 12.6% in 2015.When Henry Bolton was elected just five months ago, many in UKIP had hoped he'd be the unifying force the party needed, bringing its focus back to Brexit. But like his two predecessors, his tenure was short lived, and now UKIP is once again seeking leadership and direction. The party's most senior figures are optimistic that they can find a strong leader who will rally the members and give UKIP a voice in the Brexit debate. But among some activists who attended the emergency meeting there was frustration, even anger, at the continued turmoil at the top.Some fear another divisive contest - not least because of the financial implications for the cash-strapped party. UKIP might survive - most think it will - but for now some don't see how it can regain its place on the political playing field as the influential force it once was. Mr Batten, London MEP, said UKIP's membership had made the right decision to sack Mr Bolton.The interim leader said: ""I believe that you have made the best decision that you could in the circumstances.""Mr Bolton said he was considering legal action as a result of the way the process to get rid of him was handled, but Mr Batten responded by saying: ""Get on with the rest of your life.""Prior to the vote ex-leader Nigel Farage had backed Mr Bolton, saying  ""for all his faults"", removing him would hasten UKIP's path to ""irrelevance""."
2018-02-18,MPs want Brexit fund for UK farmers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43088855,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs scrutinising the government's plans for the agriculture industry after Brexit want funding for farmers when EU subsidies end, they said in a report.Without an EU-UK trade deal, farm exports face tariffs from March 2019.UK shoppers would also likely see price rises from EU imports such as Danish pork and French cheese, the MPs found.However the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it could both ""secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting farmers"".The environment secretary Michael Gove told farmers in January the government would guarantee subsidies at the current EU level only until the 2022 election.The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee assessed the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO) levels of tariffs and regulations being applied to UK-EU food trade, if no deal came out of Brexit negotiations. It today published its report, Brexit: Trade in Food. The report acknowledges the Government's intention to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement and customs agreement with the EU, but says ""there is no guarantee that this will occur.""Newport West's Paul Flynn sits on the Commons' environment committee but opposes a recommendation in a report on how leaving the EU could impact the food trade.The Labour MP said a special fund should not be set up to help, because in some cases it would be ""income support for super rich"".""In the event that the UK leaves the EU without a free-trade agreement, UK-EU trade will proceed under WTO rules. Reverting to WTO tariffs will have a significant impact upon agriculture as tariffs are higher for agricultural products than for other goods and services,"" the report states.UK exports would become less competitive in EU markets if WTO rules applied. MPs on the committee suggested the switch from the single market to potential import and export tariffs on food between the UK and EU 27 could force the government to offer funding to farmers as they adjust.The report says ""Defra should consider providing a fund to support our food producing industry to adapt effectively to the challenge ahead.""The National Farmers Union (NFU) echoed the report's findings and its chief EU exit adviser Gail Soutar said there would be ""significant impact on Britain's farmers and domestic food supply"" if no deal was reached.The committee said the sheep farming industry could in particular be worse-off if the EU slapped WTO tariffs on UK lamb.The MPs on the committee heard ""the EU is very important for UK sheep meat exports, with more than 95% of its export volume destined for the EU.""The report said if sheep meat exports defaulted on to the usual tariff, which would increase their prices by 50%, they would become uncompetitive on the EU market.British shoppers would also see prices rise at the supermarket, if this import tax pushed up production costs for food made here or if the UK government slapped tariffs on food imports from the EU.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium said the committee's report highlighted the cost of a no-deal outcome for farmers, food producers and shoppers across the UK.""If the UK leaves the EU with no trade agreement, the average WTO tariff of 22% that would be applied to imports, would increase prices for consumers... this would be an unappetising hit to their weekly food bills. ""Given that over two thirds of our food that is imported comes from the EU to supplement UK production, the scale of this potential impact is clear.""Ms Dickinson said that the UK government should not simply cut all tariffs on imported food to help consumers out.""The answer does not lie in unilaterally dropping tariffs to zero, due to the devastating consequences this would have for the UK's agricultural industry.""The committee's report said such a reaction would ""put many UK farmers out of business and render the UK dependent on imported food"".The NFU also warned against the country lowering tariffs across the board, which would open the UK market up to more, potentially cheaper, food imports.The industry is concerned cheaper imports will be available because of lower environmental and animal welfare standards in the countries they are produced - and that the UK's import rules may be softened in order to sign trade deals.However a Defra spokesperson said: ""Leaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free trade deals while supporting our farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food.  ""Any future [EU-UK] deal must work for UK farmers, businesses and consumers, and we will not compromise on our high environmental or welfare standards."" The agriculture industry employs one in eight people in the UK.Farm and food production is worth around £110bn per year and the EU is both the largest recipient of British farm produce and the largest exporter of such goods into the UK."
2018-02-18,Oxfam chief: 'Attacks out of proportion',https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43095679,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOxfam's chief executive, Mark Goldring, has said the scale and intensity of the criticism against his organisation in the wake of claims its workers used prostitutes in Haiti is out of proportion to its level of culpability.He told the Guardian newspaper: ""The intensity and the ferocity of the attack makes you wonder, what did we do? ""We murdered babies in their cots?"" Mr Goldring also suggested that critics are motivated by an anti-aid agenda.The charity boss said that ""anything we say is being manipulated... even apologies only make matters worse.""He acknowledged Oxfam could have acted faster but said ""what I felt really clearly is many people haven't wanted to listen to explanations"".Earlier this month, news reports said that during a humanitarian mission in Haiti in 2011, the charity's country director hired prostitutes at a villa paid for by Oxfam.The charity faced more criticism when it emerged that it had not shared details of the allegations with the Haitian government.Oxfam apologises in a full page advertisement in today's Guardian in which it says sorry to the people of Haiti and the charity's supporters. The ad, paid for by supporters rather than the charity, also sets out the actions the organisation plans to take, including tripling Oxfam's safeguarding capacity and establishing a review into improving its culture.Another charity - Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) - has now come under question as the president of Haiti called for an investigation into the activities of aid agencies working in his country.Jovenel Moise, asked why the medical charity MSF had repatriated 17 of its staff members.He told the Reuters news agency:  ""The Oxfam case is the visible part of the iceberg,""It is not only Oxfam, there are other NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in the same situation, but they hide the information internally.""MSF said it took reports of staff misconduct seriously and was seeking to clarify questions raised by the president.Oxfam has agreed to stop bidding for UK government funding until it can show it meets the ""high standards"" required, ministers say.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the charity had ""a long way to go"" before regaining the trust of the public, its staff and the people it aims to help.The charity, which had a total income of £409m last year, received £31.7m from the government in 2016, accounting for about 8% of the charity's income.The amount also represents about a quarter of a percent of the government's annual foreign aid spending.Oxfam is setting up a commission to investigate past and present allegations of exploitation by staff.Other planned reforms include new funding for safeguarding measures and a crackdown on references issued to former staff.Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

She said Sinn Féin warned the DUP to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.However, Mrs Foster has said no draft agreement was in place.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement because they were insisting on having this free-standing Irish language act,"" she said. During Mrs Bradley's walkabout on Friday, she was asked if there was a draft deal between Sinn Féin and the DUP, but she replied that she was not involved in their negotiations.On Thursday night, DUP MP Gregory Campbell rejected any suggestion that DUP party leader Arlene Foster was unable to sell a power-sharing deal with Sinn Féin to her party.Speaking to the BBC's The View programme, the DUP MP said there was no threat to Mrs Foster's leadership.Mr Campbell said: ""Arlene Foster has no difficulty within the party, didn't have any difficulty last weekend, and won't have any difficulty this weekend. ""Any nonsense that people are peddling, that calls into question Arlene Foster's leadership - you really need to get a grip,"" he added.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said there was an easy way for Sinn Féin and the DUP ""to solve the mystery of what they did agree or didn't agree"". ""Whether they called it an accommodation, a draft agreement, a heads of agreement or some other type of a deal, it's time for both parties to publish them and publish them now,"" he said. "
2018-02-18,May urges new EU security deal by 2019,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43088246,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has called for a new ""deep and special partnership"" to ensure the UK and EU can continue to work together on security after Brexit. She said new arrangements in foreign and defence policy cooperation should be effective by next year. In a speech to the Munich Security Conference the prime minister said the UK would remain committed to Europe's security after leaving the EU.New security arrangements have yet to be negotiated for after Brexit.Theresa May said that, without cooperation, the UK would no longer be able to help the European police agency Europol as it currently does or extradite suspects as quickly.  To maintain coordination on security Theresa May said the UK and EU should continue to work together on sanctions, operations on the ground and developing capabilities in defence, cyber and space.The prime minister warned that ""rigid institutional restrictions or deep-seated ideology"" should not jeopardise the security of UK citizens. ""We must do whatever is most practical and pragmatic in ensuring our collective security,"" she added.She said the UK and EU's enemies would ""like nothing better than to see us fractured"".President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said the ""security bridge between the UK and the EU would still be maintained"" but added ""you cannot mix it up with other issues.""Theresa May noted that the EU had comprehensive relationships with other countries on trade and argued that there is ""no legal or operational reason"" why similar agreements could not be reached on security. During talks with Angela Merkel on Friday, Mrs May said both sides need to be ""bold and ambitious"" in framing their future relations.The German chancellor said that while the UK could not replicate its existing membership outside the EU, she wanted relations to be ""as close as possible"".EU member states currently work closely in the fight against organised crime and terrorism.Key initiatives include the European Arrest Warrant - under which suspects can be speedily extradited between member states - Europol, the EU intelligence agency, and the Schengen Information System of real-time alerts about suspects.The UK says that while the legal framework for its membership of these arrangements will end when it leaves the EU in March 2019, it wants to draw up new working arrangements - which ministers have described as being ""as close to the status quo as possible"".In her speech, Mrs May pointed to the arrest of suspected terrorists and operations against people traffickers as examples of the benefits of cooperation across borders.The moderator at the event, Wolfgang Ischinger, said that the UK's decision to leave the EU was ""extremely regrettable"" and that ""everything would be so much easier if you stayed.""The Lib Dem's defence spokesman Sir Menzies Campbell said it was ""high time"" the prime minister said ""what she wants and what she is willing to give way on.""Theresa May has spent months calling for a deep and special economic partnership with the EU after Brexit and now her focus turns to security.  Again she's asking for a unique arrangement. Britain will be outside the EU, a ""third"" country, and it would be unprecedented for the current close cooperation  to continue. But the thrust of the British government's argument is that we should be a special case. The UK is offering its substantial resources (the second largest defence budget in NATO) and expertise in counter terrorism. The prime minister wants a treaty to enshrine what Downing Street describes as the real, tangible benefits of cooperation, and says failure to sign up will play into the hands of our enemies who'd like nothing more than to see Europe divided. Her warning to EU leaders is blunt. Don't let your deep seated ideology put Europe's citizens in danger. Mrs May has consistently said that she won't use security as a bargaining chip, that her offer is ""unconditional"" but that's no guarantee that the EU would simply accept a request from the UK to continue to be a part of Europol or the European Arrest Warrant. Her hope is that the EU takes a practical, pragmatic approach because they accept that continuing to work together is mutually beneficial. Earlier this year the outgoing head of Europol, Rob Wainwright, told the BBC Brexit would mean the UK losing influence on cross-border policing and security work.""We will find other ways of influencing, more informal ways, but they will be less direct, less pronounced and probably less successful than they are now,"" he said.Mrs May's speech is one of a series dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" with her government under pressure to set out in detail what it wants life outside the EU to look like."

I think I'm a little bit in danger of becoming a gay icon!""Barbara Hosking has come out at the age of 91, as she reflects on a remarkable life in the corridors of power.As a senior civil servant she worked for two prime ministers, Edward Heath and Harold Wilson, as well as a television executive.She battled sexism throughout her career, fighting for equal pay and even to be in the room during some meetings.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett Show she explained why she never told her family about her sexuality.""My parents wouldn't have understood and they would have been shocked.""They loved me very much, but my father was very old-fashioned and conventional. My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine.

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

2018-02-18,Day of reckoning?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43031541,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe starting pistol for the review of university tuition fees in England will be fired early next week.Or at least that's the latest claim in the political twisting and turning over one of the toughest domestic decisions facing a fragile government.The last time Theresa May's review of fees seemed to be approaching, neither the education secretary Justine Greening nor the universities minister Jo Johnson seemed particularly enthusiastic - and within weeks both of them were out of their jobs. The new team - Damian Hinds and Sam Gyimah - will know they have to deliver, with the prime minister and Mr Hinds expected to lead the charge.As they head for the weekend TV studios, the next big question is what problem the fees review is trying to solve?Is it trying to kill off a political problem - with middle England still unconvinced by young people leaving university with £50,000 in debts and interest rates up to 6.1%?Or is it trying to find a fairer way of balancing the cost between student and taxpayer - and to support those who might currently be missing out, such as those in vocational training and those wanting to study part-time?There are some outcomes that are predictable. For instance, the freeze on annual fees at £9,250 is going to stretch further than this year.You can't announce a review to show you are listening and then increase fees even more, so there will either be a long-term freeze or a big cut.Lord Willetts, a former universities minister and author of A University Education, says the review could be politically ""high risk"".The government can't ""trump Corbyn"", with Labour having already established its promise to scrap fees.Lord Willetts argues that the current system is essentially a good model - it ensures that students do not have to pay up-front and it ensures universities the reliable funding that allows them to keep widening access.Where he would make changes, he says, is to reduce interest rates and give students more financial support when they are studying.This would also help parents who end up paying for their student children's living costs.There have been suggestions - often attributed to the Treasury - that the review will consider varying the level of fees depending on the likely return in graduate earnings.But Lord Willetts says this would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", concentrating more funding in the most prestigious universities and in courses that lead to the most lucrative careers.A former Labour education secretary, Charles Clarke, says the review will need ""absolute clarity of purpose"", because it is such a complicated system with so many interlocking parts.""No one seems to know what the aim of the reform in 2018 will be,"" he says.Mr Clarke says that linking fees to the likely financial returns of specific courses would ""significantly reduce fees for millions of students"".He backs cutting interest charges - and says that poorer students should have access to maintenance grants.In a theme that the current education secretary is likely to keep hearing, Mr Clarke also highlights the need to provide more support for students when they are studying.He says there should be loans that cover the real living costs and that since students are adults, this shouldn't be dependent on parental income.The former education secretary, Justine Greening, thinking more freely from the backbenches, wants maintenance grants reinstated and has raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham and biographer of prime ministers, also wants a return of maintenance grants.He wants a cut in interest rates for loans, saying the current level ""undermines the credibility of the whole scheme"".But he wants a clearer message that repayments from students are a form of graduate contribution and not a ""debt"".There are also calls for the fees review to be much wider than academic study at university - and to look more broadly at support for post-18 students taking vocational courses.Robert Halfon, chair of the education select committee, recently warned that taxpayers were currently expected to ""lavishly furnish universities"", when the real shortage was in vocational skills. But universities face their own problems.This year's Ucas application figures have been much worse than superficially they might have appeared.Among applicants in England, the numbers are the lowest since at least 2009 - even below the slump that happened when fees trebled in 2012.There is also an emerging pattern of high status universities getting bigger and attracting more applicants, while others, often doing the hardest work in widening access, are seeing a collapse in student numbers and funding.If universities were Monty Python characters, they would be like the knight who has his arms and legs chopped off - and says ""It's only a flesh wound.""They never want to look like they are in trouble. But behind their shiny prospectuses and fixed smiles, there are some university leaders who are seriously concerned about a review that can only bring them less money.But this is about politics and this is a subject which has a remarkable track record for sudden switches.It is easy to forget that in 2005 Theresa May was a shadow minister going into a general election with a Conservative manifesto promising to scrap all tuition fees.In the previous year, it had been Labour that had been on the ropes over plans to increase fees to £3,000 per year.In the general election, the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, lead the Tory campaign to end fees.He lost his seat to a youngster called Tim Farron and his education brief went to another newcomer, David Cameron. Whatever happened to them?"
2018-02-18,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-18,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat.

May replies to 'regrettable Brexit' remark",https://web.archive.org//web/20180219054140/http://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-43096455/may-replies-to-regrettable-brexit-remark,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them.  ""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them.The EU has previously said the UK will not be able to adopt its own standards and regulations and expect them to be recognised across Europe.Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said: ""The UK wants to take back control, it wants to adopt its own standards and regulations.""But it also wants to have these standards recognised automatically in the EU. That is what UK papers ask for.""This is simply impossible. You cannot be outside the single market and shape its legal order."""
2018-02-19,May rules out scrapping tuition fees,https://web.archive.org//web/20180220020254/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43106736,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe prime minister has called for better value for students in England, but has ruled out completely scrapping tuition fees.Theresa May has launched her review of tuition fees and university funding, to be chaired by the author and financier, Philip Augar.Labour has said it would abolish fees and bring back maintenance grants.But Mrs May said scrapping fees would push up taxes and mean limiting the number of university places.The prime minister, in a speech in Derby, said she remained committed to the principle that students ""who benefit directly from higher education should contribute directly towards the cost of it"".Announcing the year-long review of student finance and university funding, Mrs May warned that the system has failed to deliver sufficient competition on price.Almost all courses are charged at the maximum £9,250 per year and interest rates are up to 6.1%.The prime minister said students in England faced ""one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"" and ""the level of fees charged do not relate to the cost or quality of the course"".There are ""serious concerns"" about the cost among parents and grandparents as well as students, she said.There is a temporary freeze on fees at £9,250 and that is likely to be extended for at least another year during the review.But there were no signs from ministers of any radical cutting in the headline price of fees.Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the review was an ""unnecessary waste of time"" and showed that ""Theresa May has finally admitted that her government got it wrong"".""Labour will abolish tuition fees, bring back maintenance grants and provide free, lifelong education in further education colleges,"" said Ms Rayner.But the prime minister said that completely scrapping fees would be unfair and damaging to universities.She argued it would mean higher taxes for those who did not go to university and would mean universities had to compete for funding with schools and hospitals, with the likely outcome that limits would be introduced on the number of university places.Education Secretary Damian Hinds said he wants ""more variety"" in the level of fees, rather than almost all courses and universities charging the maximum amount.He also calls for more flexibility in how courses are delivered, such as two-year degrees, encouraging ""commuter degrees"" where students live at home and making it easier for part-time students and those who want to carry on working while studying.Former Labour education minister, Lord Adonis, called for a more significant change - arguing that fees should be much lower or abolished, in the way that had happened in Germany.He accused universities of being ""bloated"" on high fees and said they needed to ""get real"" over how much they should charge.Lord Adonis rejected the idea of different subjects having different costs as a ""big backward step"", which would reduce numbers applying for science subjects, if they became more expensive than arts and humanities.The tuition fee review also will consider ways of reducing costs such as cutting interest rates on loans and reintroducing maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, as well as examining the level of fees.Mrs May said that sure poorer students should have an ""equal chance"" in higher education - but that at present they had the greatest burden of debt.Students from poorer families are offered bigger loans for living costs than better-off students, who are expected to be partly supported by their parents, but it means they graduate with bigger debts.Restoring maintenance grants for poorer students, scrapped last year, would reduce their level of borrowing.Support for vocational training and apprenticeships in ""post-18 education"" will also be considered.The prime minister warned that the route into further technical and vocational training is ""hard to navigate"", saying the standards across the sector ""are too varied"" and the funding ""is patchy"".The Treasury select committee, chaired by former education secretary Nicky Morgan, has raised concerns about the high level of interest rates.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says students in England face more than £5,000 in interest charges before they have even left university - contributing to average graduate debts of more than £50,000.Other former Conservative and Labour education ministers Ms Greening, Lord Willetts, Lord Adonis and Charles Clarke have all raised concerns about the level of interest charges.Mrs Morgan has also called for more support for part-time students, saying that their numbers had ""collapsed"".She said that the review needed to find a way to encourage more flexibility in courses and costs, saying that when the fees system was introduced it was ""naively assumed"" there would be be more competition.But there have been warnings against different levels of fees for sciences or humanities and arts, or for different types of university.Lord Willetts said higher fees for courses with the highest graduate earnings would become a ""reverse pupil premium"", giving even more money to the most advantaged courses and institutions.Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, backed calls for more flexible approaches - such as two-year degree courses - but warned that setting different fee levels would be a ""bad idea"".Dame Janet Beer, president of Universities UK, said the current system needed to be ""better understood and feel fairer to students"". The priorities should be support for disadvantaged students and reversing the collapse in numbers of part-time and mature students, said the university group leader.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning"

""As co-guarantor to the agreement, the government will continue to engage with the parties in Northern Ireland and the British government to support the urgent formation of a new executive by the mandated political parties,"" Mr Varadkar said in a statement.""The government's firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements must be implemented in full, and in this context the Taoiseach and Tánaiste re-iterated that the Irish government does not want to see the introduction of direct rule in Northern Ireland.""Mrs Foster said ""frontline staff"" had been living ""hand-to-mouth"" for too long and that Northern Ireland's people deserved better.""School principals, hospital managers and infrastructure planners have been in limbo for months unsure of budgets and unable to get ministerial direction,"" she said.""I am not prepared to allow this to continue.""Mrs Foster said she would be raising the issue again at Westminster on Tuesday and would also be meeting the prime minister later this week, where she would ""affirm our commitment to devolution but not at any price"".Both Sinn Féin and the DUP had engaged in negotiations in a bid to end a 13-month impasse at Stormont.Sinn Féin is also expected to meet Theresa May in London later in the week.Ms McDonald has said the party still believes a restoration of devolution is possible and said the two governments should urgently convene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to avoid a prolonged stalemate.""We don't accept any call for a cooling off period, in fact we're saying very clearly that there cannot be a vacuum, we need action and we need the two governments to be decisive at this point,"" she said.""Direct rule is not acceptable. Direct rule is not on the table.""Ms McDonald also appealed to the DUP to return to the talks.Earlier on Monday, Mr Coveney said direct rule from London would not be acceptable to anyone in Northern Ireland because ""people wanted their own government and their own decision-making"".Sinn Féin has accused the DUP of collapsing the talks and party leader Ms McDonald has claimed a draft deal was in place earlier this month, which included an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act and a respecting language and diversity act.Ms McDonald has said talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn Féin about legislation for the Irish language.Mrs Foster has previously said no draft agreement was in place.""I regret that we didn't reach an agreement because they were insisting on having this free-standing Irish language act,"" she said."

We can all argue about economic forecasts and none of them are 100% accurate but you have to rely on them and if you reject evidence you don't like then you are likely to end up producing faith based policies.""Asked whether some of his former cabinet colleagues were resistant to the facts and evidence, he replied, ""not so much former cabinet colleagues.""I think there are politicians who would prefer not to have the evidence there.""Earlier this month MPs were allowed to see a set of regional forecasts that predicted hits to economic growth across the UK, based on three possible new trade arrangements.The government has faced calls to publish all of its analysis of the impact of Brexit in full, but says that to do so at this stage would damage its hand in negotiations.It also argues that its preferred option of a bespoke trade deal has not been modelled in the leaked forecasts.Mr Green added: ""If analysis is being produced then publish it. And frankly there will be a big political debate it. Let's have this argument in public, that's what democracies do.""He described Brexit as probably the hardest task faced by Whitehall since the Second World War.Ministers are still discussing ""the very big picture. which end state we want"" he said, adding: ""it's not a surprise to anyone there are differences of view inside the government on that"".Speaking on the same programme, former Brexit minister Mr Jones praised the civil service's response to the challenge of preparing for Brexit, but added: ""Probably the last of the Remain tendency are deep within the bowels of the Treasury.""There is a constitutional aversion in the Treasury to Brexit as a concept and I think in the Treasury there is an effort being made at the moment to try and drag the process out and soften it.""Mr Jones also said that Brexit Secretary David Davis had wanted the Department for Exiting the EU - set up after the Leave vote - to be called ""Department X"".He added: ""David Davis said subsequently that he preferred Department X because it had suitably sinister overtones which I think appealed to him as a former Special Forces officer."""

But while those seem to be attracting record levels of interest, that hasn't yet translated into filling the depleted ranks, he added.Mr Williamson said he wanted ""recruits who meet our world class standards [to] start their training as soon as possible"".Computer systems used in recruitment for the Army, Navy and RAF have recently been upgraded for the first time in 20 years.But while the lack of new recruits has been blamed in part on sub-standard recruitment processes, the quality of candidates has also been an issue.An Army spokesperson said ""large numbers"" of people had been turned away because they were not ""medically or physically up to it"".Two thirds of those who failed to meet the required medical standards had breathing problems, back injuries or leg injuries.The Ministry of Defence said ""a national recruiting call centre on its own has not worked,"" so it is now ""returning to a more traditional system where potential recruits get help from professional recruiters and inspiring soldiers in their local areas"".A spokesman added: ""We know it's been taking too long and people have gone elsewhere, which is why we're also making every effort to smooth the selection process and make further improvements to the time it takes to get new recruits to the start of their training.""Capita is yet to respond to the BBC's request for comment.The news comes a month after head of the Army General Sir Nick Carter said Britain's ability to respond to military threats from Russia will be ""eroded"" without further investment."

That takes the total number of jobs lost to 1,141 since the UK's second-largest construction company collapsed last month.The failure has also led to job cuts and widespread disruption among sub-contractors.However, the Official Receiver said it had saved 7,610 jobs, including 942 over the past week, as other firms buy contracts held by Carillion.The Work and Pensions and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committees have already taken evidence from former Carillion directors. On Monday, the MPs released details of written comments from the company's big shareholders.Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said there was a ""disconnect"" between what Carillion directors told MPs and the information from shareholders.""On one hand, the Carillion directors told us all was sunny"" until a major contract in Qatar went wrong.""On the other hand, investors were fleeing for the hills, and it appears those who looked closest ran fastest,"" Mr Field said.  It has emerged that one leading investor - Kiltearn Partners - considered suing Carillion.The company, which at one stage held 10% of Carillion's shares, said in a letter to the committees that it believes ""there are clear grounds for an investigation into whether Carillion's management knew, or should have known"" about the need for a major financial provision earlier than July 2017.In that month Carillion shocked the City with a profit warning and by writing down the value of contracts by £845m.Kiltearn's letter says that if Carillion had not gone into liquidation, it would have ""considered participation in civil legal action against Carillion with a view to recovering a proportion of its clients' crystalised losses"".Kiltearn began selling shares in August. At a meeting with Carillion on 13 October, they said former interim chief executive Keith Cochrane could only provide ""limited and vague"" responses to ""fundamental"" questions - and consequently Kiltearn sold all shares by 4 January this year.The investment firm Standard Life Aberdeen, in a letter to the MPs, said it began a process of divestment in December 2015 due to concerns about financial management, strategy and corporate governance.Standard Life said these were issues it raised with the board in regular meetings from the end of 2015 until the firm sold up completely in July 2017.Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee, said investors spotted that Carillion was heading for disaster and fled.The difficulty in getting a true sense of Carillion's financial health raised ""serious"" corporate governance issues, she added.""KMPG will have to explain why they signed-off on accounts which appeared to bear so little relation to reality,"" Ms Reeves said."

""Where there are allegations of this sort, MPs should be prepared to be open and transparent.""The director of the Czech Security Service Archive told the BBC that their files suggest Mr Corbyn was seen as a possible ""contact"" but no more than that. ""Mr Corbyn was not a secret collaborator working for the Czechoslovak intelligence service,"" Svetlana Ptacnikova said. ""The files we have on him are kept in a folder that starts with the identification number one. ""Secret collaborators were allocated folders that start with the number four.

""Jeremy neither has nor offered any privileged information to this or any other diplomat,"" it added.Meanwhile, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said the leader had instructed lawyers to contact Conservative MP Ben Bradley over a tweet he said was libellous.""Jeremy has instructed solicitors to contact Ben Bradley to delete his libellous tweet or face legal action,"" the spokesman said.The tweet, which claimed the Labour leader ""sold British secrets to Communist spies"", has now been deleted."
2018-02-19,'Bring forward' Commons boundaries vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20180220020254/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43111790,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are being urged to decide at the earliest opportunity whether to cut the size of the Commons, to avoid outdated boundaries at the next election.Current changes are being drawn up on the basis of a 2011 law which agreed in principle to cut numbers by 50 to 600.But many MPs do not now support it and could reject it in a vote this autumn.The Public Administration Committee said there would then be no time to start again and the 2022 poll would be held on out-dated boundaries.The last time boundaries were reviewed were between 2004 and 2006 in time for the 2010 general election.Since 2011, the Boundary Commissions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are required to redraw the UK's political map every five years to take account of changes in population shifts. Officials started work on a new review in 2016, which is due to report to Parliament by September 2018.However, the situation is complicated by the fact that they are working on the assumption - no longer supported by many MPs - that the House of Commons will be reduced from its current size of 650 MPs.This was a commitment made by David Cameron in the wake of the 2009 Commons expenses scandal, when he proposed a smaller legislature among measures to cut the cost of politics.The principle was set out in legislation passed by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government in 2011, which also included changes to make constituencies more uniform in size. But following wrangling between the Tories and Lib Dems, MPs voted in 2013 against beginning the process in time for the 2015 election, pushing it back to 2018. As a result, last year's snap general election was also held on the 2010 boundaries.In the meantime, the mood in Westminster has hardened against the idea of smaller Commons.Conservative and Labour MPs are sceptical about the idea of doing away with 32 constituencies in England and 11 in Wales, arguing it will favour one party over the other and increase the workload of the remaining MPs. The SNP are opposed to plans to reduce Scottish representation at Westminster by six seats while the DUP, on whom Theresa May relies upon for her Commons majority, has expressed concerns about the proposed changes in Northern Ireland, which would see one seat disappear and others change in character. Proposed breakdown in seats if numbers cut to 600The cross-party committee said it was ""unlikely"" that MPs would support the move later this year and that there had to be a Plan B for Parliament to consider.""The time to decide this in principle is now,"" said Bernard Jenkin, the Tory MP who chairs the committee.""If the government waits until the autumn, Parliament will be faced with an invidious choice - either approve the new boundaries or hold the next election on boundaries that will be over 20 years out of date.""But if we decide this now, it would be possible to change the law so new boundaries at 650 seats can be in place before the next election.""Labour suggested the existing proposals were ""undemocratic"" and called for the review to fully take into account ""community ties and geography"".Shadow minister Cat Smith said her party was ready to work with others to ensure a boundary review could go ahead ""in a way that benefits our democracy, not just the Conservative Party"". The Boundary Commission for England, which completed its consultation on its revised proposals in December, said Mr Jenkin was correct there would not be enough time for them to restart their work should the existing review be rejected.

Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

I think I'm a little bit in danger of becoming a gay icon!""Barbara Hosking has come out at the age of 91, as she reflects on a remarkable life in the corridors of power.As a senior civil servant she worked for two prime ministers, Edward Heath and Harold Wilson, as well as a television executive.She battled sexism throughout her career, fighting for equal pay and even to be in the room during some meetings.Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett Show she explained why she never told her family about her sexuality.""My parents wouldn't have understood and they would have been shocked.""They loved me very much, but my father was very old-fashioned and conventional. My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine.

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

That is, not going anywhere positive.After the false dawn of 2010, there followed years of economic calamity as the financial crisis morphed into a currency crisis and the economic collapse of Europe's smaller, indebted economies, led by Greece and infecting Portugal and Ireland, as well as Spain.European Union growth rate at 10-year highHammond joins Brexit roadshowBank hints at earlier and larger rate risesA currency and quasi-political union ill-suited to the flexibility needed to deal with countries at very different stages of the economic cycle was stamped ""basket case"". Many critics of the European project polished their dancing shoes, ready for a tango on the EU's grave.Those problems are still extant. The closer political and economic union proposed by France, for example, is the next big test of the EU's governments and economies.As well as the very high, though falling, unemployment levels across continental Europe, particularly amongst the young.  But, the project (without, in the future, Britain, of course) is still together - tensions and all - and growth has finally bounced back, across not just the eurozone, but the European Union as well.Today's Eurostat figures show that the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, was particularly strong across most EU members as global growth momentum starts kicking in.Germany, France and Spain rely on exports just as the UK does and higher demand has led to higher profits for businesses.The latest UBS data on firms' earnings per share - a good proxy for how positive corporate data are looking - showed a 2017 figure of 12%.Its eurozone economic surprise index - a measure of whether economic data is better or worse than forecast - is comfortably in the mid-60s (where above 50 is positive), figures not seen since the beginning of 2014.Structural reforms across the EU have helped, particularly in Spain and France, where Emmanuel Macron is the new darling of business.But it is global growth that is lifting all boats, boosted by monetary policies set for a broadly recessionary landscape.Interest rates in the eurozone, for example, are still negative.Central banks are slowly catching up with the better economic figures and withdrawing some of the expansionary booster rockets.But they are on a gentle path, given that there is little evidence of an inflationary spike any time soon.For Britain, where growth is still reasonable but has slowed since the Brexit referendum, better EU growth is good news.Nearly half of all we export goes to the EU.And we are still in the single market and the customs union, which gives us tariff free access to the EU.That relationship will change.But the UK is still a major beneficiary as the EU marches forward.

2018-02-19,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180220020254/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

It's about timing.As we've discussed many times before, Theresa May's base in her party are the Eurosceptics.With no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival.They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions.But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit."

It reported contacts Mr Corbyn is alleged to have had with Mr Sarkocy, who was working in the Czechoslovakian embassy in London, towards the end of the Cold War in 1986 and 1987.Czech officials have since told the BBC Mr Corbyn was a ""person of interest"" to their intelligence agencies but not an informant, contradicting claims reportedly made by Mr Sarkocy.The story has been widely reported by British newspapers, prompting calls by Theresa May for Mr Corbyn to be open about his past actions and one cabinet minister to accuse him of ""betraying"" Britain. Mr Corbyn has previously declined to comments on the claims, but earlier on Tuesday at an event in London he was asked directly whether he was a Czech spy, replying ""no"".The Labour leader has now upped the ante, releasing a video message to supporters accusing newspapers of reporting ""increasingly wild and entirely false"" claims made by Mr Sarkocy.""In the last few days, The Sun, The Mail, The Telegraph and The Express have all gone a little bit James Bond.""It's easy to laugh, but something more serious is happening,"" he said.""Publishing these ridiculous smears that have been refuted by Czech officials shows just how worried the media bosses are by the prospect of a Labour government. ""They're right to be. Labour will stand up to the powerful and corrupt - and take the side of the many, not the few.""Mr Corbyn said the right-wing press had become less powerful in the era of social media and ""their bad habits were becoming less and less relevant"". ""A free press is essential for democracy and we don't want to close it down, we want to open it up. At the moment, much of our press isn't very free at all. ""In fact it's controlled by billionaire tax exiles, who are determined to dodge paying their fair share for our vital public services.""Instead of learning these lessons they're continuing to resort to lies and smears. Their readers - you, all of us - deserve so much better. Well, we've got news for them: change is coming.""The BBC understands the phrase ""change is coming"" refers to Labour's plans to go ahead with a second stage of the Leveson inquiry into press ethics as well a review of media ownership and plurality.The Sun issued a statement hitting back at the Labour leader and defending its coverage.""Over the past few days, we have revealed substantial, documented evidence from the Czech security archive that a Czech spy met with Jeremy Corbyn at the height of the Cold War,"" it said, adding that it was in the public interest to know details of the meeting.""Those questions are yet to be answered and we will keep asking them, no matter how inconvenient they might be, nor how many times we are threatened with 'change' - whatever that may mean.""They are questions that we would put to anybody who aspires to the highest office in the land."""
2018-02-20,Peers urged to retire to cut Lords size,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43126321,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May is urging Labour and the Liberal Democrats to encourage more of their peers to retire to cut the size of the House of Lords.The prime minister said the Tories had a better record of ""embracing retirement at the appropriate time"".She also vowed to end the ""automatic entitlement"" to a peerage for holders of high public office.Labour said the PM was just putting off Lords reform ""to some uncertain time in the future"" with her comments.The House of Lords - with 792 members - is the world's second largest Parliamentary chamber.Mrs May was responding to calls by the cross-party Lord Speaker's committee for a ""two out, one in"" system to cut the number of peers by a quarter to 600 - 50 fewer than the House of Commons.The PM committed to reducing the size of the chamber but said a call for a maximum term of 15 years to cap numbers requires ""further careful thought and wider engagement"", including with MPs.In a letter to the Lord Speaker Lord Fowler, she said she would be appointing a ""small list"" of new Tory peers ""in due course"" but vowed to continue acting with ""restraint"" when it came to political appointees.And she suggested senior police officers, judges and other public office holders should no longer automatically expect a peerage, although this would not apply to Bishops, who are selected under a different process.In his cross-party report, committee chairman Lord Burns set a target of 139 departures by 2022 - and Mrs May said this could only be achieved if all parties encouraged their peers to retire earlier.The average retirement age for peers, since 2015, is 83, according to a House of Lords Library briefing.Lord Fowler welcomed the PM's ""statement of intent"" to cut the size of the Lords, saying: ""She has challenged the House and its members to deliver their part in reducing numbers. ""The ability to reduce the size of the House is now within our own control. I intend to work with the political leaders in the House to agree how best to take this forward.""But a Labour Party spokesman said: ""With this Conservative government everything seems to be put off to some uncertain time in the future - Lords reform included. ""As well as ending the hereditary principle for good, we ultimately want to see an elected second chamber but Theresa May has ducked giving a proper response.""Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for a ""slimmed-down, fairly-elected chamber,"" said the PM should should ""lead by example and suspend all new appointments until there are real plans for reform"".The Conservatives are the largest party in the Lords with 250 peers (31%), followed by Labour with 199 (25%) and the Liberal Democrats 100 (13%). There are 184 crossbenchers (23%), 24 Bishops and 41 othersAs of 11 December 2017, the oldest member was 98 - and two members shared the youngest age of 39The mean age was 69There were 216 female members (26%), an increase from 24% in June 2015Source: House of Lords Library briefingSince entering Downing Street, Mrs May has appointed eight peers, including three political appointments as ministers.She also appointed five ""distinguished public servants"" including the Lord Chief Justice, a former Bishop of London, a former Metropolitan Police commissioner, a former chief of defence staff and a former private secretary to the Queen.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has appointed just one peer, former Liberty director Baroness Chakrabarti, in that time. The Lib Dems have not appointed any new peers.Across all parties, 24 peers have been created and two hereditary peers elected, while 28 have retired, and 16 have died - and two have been removed for non-attendance.It has left the overall size of the Lords down by 20 members under Mrs May's premiership - and her official spokesman said she ""intends for that trend to continue"".At the moment, peers can serve for life once appointed, although rules introduced in 2014 making it easier for them to retire, has increased the turnover in the House.Since July 2016, 11 Conservatives have retired from the Lords, compared with four Labour members, three Liberal Democrats, one DUP member and nine cross-benchers, who have no party allegiance. Under Lord Burns' formula, 129 Conservative peers would be expected to depart by 2027 while Labour and the Lib Dems would see 102 and 50 departures respectively and 93 crossbenchers would also leave.Britain is thought to be the only democracy in the world with a second chamber larger than its first.The only assembly which is bigger is the Chinese National People's Congress with 2,924 members but that does not have a second chamber. The European Parliament, with 751, has slightly fewer members than the House of Lords."

British business could ""never be cheaper than China"" and must focus instead on product and service quality.He also suggested a Brexit deal by the end of 2018 was ""well on the cards"". The Brexit secretary's address to Austrian business leaders in Vienna is the latest in a series of speeches the UK government is calling ""the road to Brexit"" as it faces demands to spell out details of the future partnership it wants with the EU.The UK says it wants to avoid obstacles to smooth trade with the EU although it is leaving the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in March 2019.Mr Davis said this can be achieved if both sides recognise each other's standards and regulations, promising the UK will ""continue our track record of meeting high standards"" once outside the EU.The government has previously spoken of adopting a ""new economic model"" to stay competitive if it is locked out of the EU single market after Brexit, and Labour has claimed the UK could be turned into a ""low-wage, offshore tax haven"".Mr Davis hit back at the government's critics in his speech, invoking the Mad Max series of action films which portray societal collapse in a lawless future world.""They fear that Brexit could lead to an Anglo-Saxon race to the bottom,"" Mr Davis said.""With Britain plunged into a Mad Max-style world borrowed from dystopian fiction. These fears about a race to the bottom are based on nothing, not our history, not our intentions, not our national interest.""But while I profoundly disagree with those who spread these fears — it does remind us all that we must provide reassurance.""What did we learn from the Brexit secretary @Jo_Coburn asks @BBCVickiYoung #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/IgTD52MqQuEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsThe UK, he said, would never prosper in a new era of intensified globalisation by cutting standards since it ""would never be cheaper than China or have more resources than Brazil"".He said UK's post-Brexit economic relationship with the EU should be based on the principles of ""open trade and fair competition"".As part of this, once the UK has left, it would not allow firms heavily subsidised by EU governments ""unfettered access"" to its markets nor permit mergers between UK and EU firms which reduced consumer choice. ""A crucial part of any such agreement is the ability for both sides to trust each other's regulations and the institutions that enforce them,"" he added.""Such mutual recognition will naturally require close, even-handed co-operation between these authorities and a common set of principles to guide them.""Last year EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""simply impossible"" for the UK to adopt its own standards and regulations while also having them recognised automatically in the EU. Labour said past comments by some senior ministers showed they wanted to use Brexit as a vehicle to ""drive down"" environmental standards and employment rights when, instead, they should be extended. ""David Davis's promise... isn't worth the paper it's written on,"" said shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer.The general secretary of the GMB union, Tim Roache, said: """"If the best this Government can do is promise Britain will not turn into a 'Mad Max' nightmare - it's no wonder people are worried about their post-Brexit lives.""The Institute of Directors' Allie Renison said they were ""pleased that Davis acknowledges the importance of keeping a level playing field on state aid and competition policy. Minimising trade barriers can and should go hand in hand with a future deal with the EU"".Trust levels in the UK were fairly high as EU finance ministers arrived for a regular meeting in Brussels today. After all, they have seen their British colleagues largely play by the rules for the last four decades. But what happens next?Luxembourg's finance minister sees it as a balance: stick to European standards and goods will flow freely between the two, go your own way and trade won't be as smooth.And the EU doesn't just want a pledge, they want rules, a process, a mechanism that binds the UK into what Brussels calls the Level Playing Field, or the LPF. Magdalena Andersson of Sweden summed up why, saying: ""Of course I trust David Davis but we don't know who will come after him some day in the future.""""They have all talked about further liberalising the labour market and part of the problem ... is their record"" @ChukaUmunna before criticising the record of Iain Duncan Smith #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/FrxwzWU2xYEnd of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politics""Let me give you a list of them, I wrote them out before I came"" Iain Duncan Smith on regulations #bbcdp pic.twitter.com/2BK4uYpHXFEnd of Twitter post 3 by @daily_politics"

STORMONT EXCLUSIVE: 'The Draft Agreement Text' - By Eamonn Mallie and Brian Rowan https://t.co/UK0s1thCjvEnd of Twitter post  by @EamonnMallieHe says: ""On page 5 under the heading: Respecting Languages and Culture, there is specific reference to the Irish (Respecting Language and Diversity) Bill and the Ulster Scots (Respecting Language and Diversity) Bill and a Respecting Language and Diversity Bill.""It has to be stated that square brackets obtain in this eight-line paragraph - meaning it had not yet been signed off and agreed.""Journalist Brian Rowan, who worked alongside Mr Mallie on the leaked document, told BBC NI's Spotlight programme that at no stage during the negotiations was there a ""done deal"".However, he said he had seen correspondence between senior members of the DUP and Sinn Féin under the heading ""draft agreement text"".There were ""presentational"" issues over the language bills, he suggested, with Sinn Féin viewing them as stand-alone acts but the DUP seeing them as a package.Mr Rowan said these presentational issues were contained within square brackets within the draft document, as they were ""matters still to be resolved... particularly around how they would be presented by the two parties"". ""We were at the 59th minute of the 11th hour and someone panicked,"" he said.""Someone took cold feet and this thing got unpicked.""The papers show that DUP leader Arlene Foster would have been first minister in the event of an agreement.They also suggest that a longer time to resolve differences had been allocated in the eventuality that the executive would collapse again. This would see an initial period of six weeks, and an additional period of 18 weeks for parties, in which parties could attempt to resolve future issues. Therefore, avoiding the immediate dissolution of the assembly that happened when Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in January 2017. Mr Rowan said the documents showed no signs of resolution over the issue of same-sex marriage. Eamonn Mallie says the 13-page document he has obtained was sent by DUP negotiators to their Sinn Féin counterparts late on the night of Friday 9 February. That's five days before the Stormont talks collapsed. The paper says the two main priorities of any new executive would have been implementing health reforms and dealing with the impact of Brexit. A section on language confirms plans for three separate bills, dealing with Irish, Ulster Scots and the importance of respect and tolerance. Square brackets indicate some details may still have been under discussion, but there are clear plans for the creation of Irish and Ulster Scots commissioners, simultaneous translation for people speaking at the Assembly and a translation unit within the finance department. The document says English would remain the language used in courts, but Irish and other languages could be facilitated when deemed necessary.  On same-sex marriage, the Mallie document says only that the parties hold different policy positions on the issue. The DUP's Edwin Poots said the party would not be publishing any of the papers as ""it would be an act of bad faith"". ""If others wish to publish elements of the talks that's a matter for them,"" he said.""Such a publication will not undermine anything that the DUP has said in public or private.""Sinn Féin and the DUP had been in negotiations to end the 13-month stalemate at Stormont.The devolved government collapsed in a row over a botched green energy scheme.After the latest talks collapsed on Wednesday, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said a deal had been in place the week before.She said the DUP was warned to ""close the deal before those opposed to it could unpick"" it.The DUP leader has said no draft agreement was in place. Mrs Foster said the talks failed due to disagreements with Sinn Féin about legislation for the Irish language.Mrs Foster has called on Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to set a budget and take key decisions about the region's schools, hospitals and infrastructure. But in an update to MPs on Tuesday, Mrs Bradley declined to immediately re-impose direct rule from Westminster.She also raised the prospect of another Assembly election.Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet the DUP and Sinn Féin leaders at the House of Commons on Wednesday."

Mr Corbyn pointed to the ongoing attempt by manufacturing turnaround firm Melrose to gain control of engineering giant GKN as a further example of ""short-term performance and narrow shareholder value (being) prioritised over long-run growth and broader economic benefit"".Labour would broaden the scope of the public interest test applied to such takeovers, he said.Mr Corbyn also discussed Brexit, saying businesses needed clarity on market access regulations.Taking questions afterwards about his party's position, he said ""we have to have a customs union"" with the EU after Brexit. And while the UK would no longer ""automatically"" be a member of the EU's single market after Brexit, Labour wanted a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".Responding to his remarks for the Conservatives, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury Robert Jenrick said:  ""Labour don't know how to handle the economy and would end up harming Britain's businesses, and there would be fewer good jobs for people as a result. ""We are stepping in to make sure businesses play by the rules, after Labour's failure to properly regulate the banks.""At the same EEF event, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will hail the UK's manufacturing sector, saying the government is already ""laying the groundwork"" for new trading relationships across Africa and Asia after Brexit."

The 1998 Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, demands mandatory coalition government involving both unionists and nationalists.Responding to Mr Coveney's comments, UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said that he was ""not conscious of anybody talking down the Good Friday Agreement, adding that ""certainly nobody in government has"". Speaking in Vienna, Mr Davis said that ""everything we are doing is aiming towards ensuring we meet every aspect of it (the 1998 Agreement), so I don't foresee that being a problem"". The three Brexiteers have expressed support for a rethink of the political arrangements brought about by the Good Friday Agreement after the failure of the latest attempt to restore devolution.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Féin blamed each other after talks broke down in acrimony last week over the Irish language.

Mr Hannan said his objections to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) ""were not on orange or green grounds but on democratic grounds"".Ms Hoey argued that her scepticism of the 1998 accord had ""nothing at all to do with Brexit"". She tweeted: ""Hiding head in sand over viability of sustainability of mandatory coalition is reckless and wrong.""Ms Hoey was responding to criticism from her Labour Party colleague, Owen Smith, the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland. Mr Smith said it was ""reckless and utterly wrong to question the value and sustainability of the Good Friday Agreement"".

He added that the current British and Irish governments remain ""absolutely committed to GFA"".Mr Coveney's party colleague, Fine Gael Senator Neale Richmond, was even more forthright in his criticism of Brexiteers.He tweeted: ""Not content with stirring up horrible xenophobia in the campaign, they now want to destroy peace in Ireland for their petty brand of British nationalism!""Not content with stirring up horrible xenophobia in the campaign, they now want to destroy peace in Ireland for their petty brand of British nationalism!

Brexit is emphatically not a threat to peace in Northern Ireland. https://t.co/n46LqyQMmiEnd of Twitter post 2 by @OwenPatersonMr Paterson also pointed to a recent interview with former Ulster Unionist Party leader, Lord Trimble, one of the architects of the 1998 peace deal. Lord Trimble told BrexitCentral that it was ""rubbish that Brexit will undermine the Good Friday Agreement"".Mr Paterson, who served as Northern Ireland secretary from May 2010 to September 2012, now supports calls for interim direct rule from Westminster in the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive.He said this would also provide time ""to discuss practical improvements to Belfast Agreement"".The Conservative MP told those who were angered by Ruth Dudley Edwards' article they ""should recognise that NI citizens deserve good government"" as their health services were ""falling behind the rest of the UK"". In December the UK and the EU reached a deal on Brexit which specifically referenced the Good Friday Agreement. The deal contained a ""fallback"" clause regarding Northern Ireland in which the UK undertook, in the absence of other agreed solutions, to ""maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which, now or in the future, support north-south co-operation, the all-island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement"". The latest political exchanges come as British and EU officials are working on how to put the Brussels deal into a more legally enforceable form."

I think it is going to become impossible for the party to influence the Brexit debate,"" he told BBC Radio Kent.On his own future, he said he was not ""in the mood to do nothing"" but dodged the issue of whether he was planning to launch a new pro-Brexit party.Mr Bolton has three children, including a daughter who his wife, Tatiana Smurova-Bolton, gave birth to at London's St Pancras Station in 2016, after going into labour on a train."
2018-02-20,Oxfam scandal: Thousands cancel donations,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43121833,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAbout 7,000 people have stopped making regular donations to Oxfam since it emerged some of its staff used prostitutes in Haiti, MPs have heard.Oxfam boss Mark Goldring apologised to the International Development Committee for the damage done to people in Haiti and the wider efforts of aid workers.He said 26 claims of sexual misconduct had been made since the scandal broke.Save the Children's Kevin Watkins also gave evidence, saying his charity had investigated 53 allegations in 2016.Mr Goldring and two other senior Oxfam executives faced an uncomfortable morning of questions from MPs about the sexual misconduct of the charity's workers in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010.The urgent session, called by the committee in response to allegations appearing earlier this month in the Times newspaper, was marked by repeated apologies.Oxfam, which has almost 10,000 staff working in more than 90 countries, has denied a cover-up but its handling of the scandal is being investigated by the Charity Commission.Since the story broke, Mr Goldring, who became chief executive in 2013, said 26 reports of recent and historic incidents had been made by Oxfam workers - 16 of them outside the UK.Of the scandal, he said: ""I am sorry, we are sorry, for the damage Oxfam has done both to the people of Haiti but also to wider efforts for aid and development by possibly undermining public support.""He denied there had been a cover-up, saying Oxfam had been trying to deliver a huge programme with 500 staff, and his predecessors would have believed they were making the right decision at the time. ""I don't defend that decision,"" he said. Mr Goldring also said he was ""deeply sorry"" for his remarks in a Guardian interview in defence of Oxfam when he said the attacks on the charity were as if it had ""murdered babies in their cots"".He told MPs that at the time of the original investigation, Oxfam issued a press release revealing its findings of ""serious misconduct"" involving bullying, intimidation and breaches of the charity's code of conduct - but did not mention sexual exploitation.""At the time, people thought that was being transparent. We know now that that was not enough,"" said Mr Goldring.""I suspect there was a balance of saying 'Oxfam is delivering life-saving assistance to a million people in Haiti. We have got to keep that work going'.""He added: ""Not every organisation chooses to tell the public about something they got wrong.""He said there was now a safeguarding team and helpline at Oxfam and the charity was seeking more independent support.Caroline Thomson, the chair of trustees since 2017, and Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International, both told the committee they were ""ashamed"" of what happened in Haiti.Ms Byanyima said the situation was ""painful"" as she has spent her life protecting women. The number of lost donations referred to by Mr Goldring relates to direct debits. Oxfam confirmed later it had lost 7,094 direct debits - representing about 3.5% of the total number of donations received through that method. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningCommittee chairman Stephen Twigg said MPs would conduct a full inquiry into sexual misconduct in the aid sector.Save the Children UK's chief executive Mr Watkins told the committee said his charity had produced two reports warning that ""predatory men"" were seeking to use aid work as an opportunity for abuse.""What has come to light over the past few weeks cautions all of us against complacency,"" he said.He said Save the Children has been pushing for an ""international humanitarian passport"", which could be revoked if aid workers breach rules.Mr Watkins said of the 53 ""safeguarding cases"" it had investigated in 2016, 20 files had been passed to police and 11 staff members had been dismissed.He added across Save The Children UK and International there were 35 cases of staff harassment reported and 19 staff dismissed.A redacted version of an internal Oxfam report from 2011, released on Monday, revealed that three of the men accused of sexual misconduct in Haiti physically threatened witnesses during an investigation.It also showed an employee was dismissed and three resigned for using prostitutes on Oxfam premises and the use of underage prostitutes was not ruled out.During the committee hearing, it emerged that one of them was re-employed for Oxfam on a short-term contract in another country.In the report, the charity said director of operations in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, ""admitted using prostitutes"" at his Oxfam residence. Last week, he denied paying prostitutes for sex.He was granted a ""phased and dignified exit"" and was allowed to resign, the report added, so long as he fully co-operated with the rest of the 2011 investigation.It is not known if he was one of the suspects accused of threatening witnesses.Do you have any information related to this story that you wish to share?

2018-02-20,Gove backing Brexit farm workers support,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43127524,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government would support a special deal for EU farm workers after Brexit, Michael Gove has signalled. The environment secretary said the case for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme after the UK leaves the EU next year was ""compelling.""Agriculture needed access to foreign workers to remain productive and profitable, he told the National Farming Union's annual conference.NFU president Meurig Raymond said a ""reliable workforce"" was essential.The farming industry has called for clarity on the rules which will apply to EU migrants living and working in the UK after March 2019, and during a proposed ""implementation period"" up until the end of 2020. The UK has said those living in the UK for more than five years can apply for permanent residence, but the status of temporary and seasonal labour is less clear.  Mr Gove acknowledged concerns that the number of EU workers coming to the UK for short-term employment picking fruit and harvesting crops was falling, partly - he said - due to the growing strength of EU economies. Contrary to what was often reported, he said many EU nationals working in British agriculture were highly skilled - such as the 90% of UK abattoir vets hailing from the continent - and would be difficult to replace. Continuing access to temporary and permanent labour, he said, had to be at the centre of a special ""transition"" deal for the industry, which has been guaranteed current levels of EU subsidies will continue until 2022.""Farming currently depends on access to labour abroad, both seasonal and more permanent,"" he said.""In future, we will need to look further afield than just the EU and we will need to think more creatively. But I also understand you need to action quickly, not least to deal with imminent pressures in the year ahead. ""And the NFU has put forward strong and, in my view, compelling arguments for a seasonal agricultural workers scheme.""Recognising the industry's ""impatience"" for reassurance, he said the government expected to announce more details about the scheme shortly. While farming had to become more capital and less labour-intensive in the long-term, he said immigration policy after Brexit must take into account the fact that many businesses were dependent on foreign, flexible labour.""We need that labour if we are to keep our farming sector productive and profitable.""The UK operated a six-month seasonal agricultural workers scheme for decades until it was closed in 2013. Some Brexit supporters say this allowed UK farmers to become hooked on cheap, foreign labour, perpetuating low productivity and denying opportunities to British workers.The farming industry is worried about the impact of leaving the single market and customs union, given that the EU accounts for 60% of exports and 70% of imports.Several ministers have said Brexit could help lower food prices, by enabling the UK to reduce tariffs on imports from developing countries and do trade deals more geared to the UK's needs. But NFU president Meurig Raymond suggested there would be a price to be paid from pursuing a ""cheap food policy"".""Those who advocate... scouring the world for low-cost food should bear in mind the price paid in traceability, in standards and in the off-shoring of environmental impact,"" he said.""British farmers are extremely proud of the standards they adhere to. We mustn't let those standards slip and be undermined by a bad trade deal during Brexit negotiations.""Britain's farms need access to the EU market, we need access to a reliable workforce and we need measures to help our food and farming industry be more productive."""

2018-02-20,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-20,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43113714,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Cutting tuition fees for university students without changing anything else would make the system less progressive.Reality Check verdict: If no other parts of the system were changed, a simple cut in tuition fees would not help those lower-income graduates who would not repay their loans within 30 years and would help higher-income graduates who would repay them.  Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer.

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

2018-02-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-20,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221014401/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Here's what happened. It was a noisy, boisterous session, which had the Speaker in full headmaster mode even before Mr Corbyn had got to his feet - it was the first of several interventions from John Bercow.""We have recently had a report on harassment.  Let's try to behave properly in these sessions"" says the SpeakerHe tells MPs: ""I could not care less about the press gallery. Huge numbers of people outside this place disapprove of this sort of behaviour.” #pmqs pic.twitter.com/1v0BpBlnxgEnd of Twitter post  by @daily_politicsMr Corbyn decided to focus on Brexit - and managed to raise a smile from the PM with his first question on David Davis's ""Mad Max"" speech, in which the Brexit secretary reassured the country life outside the EU would not be like a scene from a lawless Aussie dystopia. ""Doesn't the PM feel he (Mr Davis) could set the bar just a little bit higher?,"" asked Mr Corbyn. The PM was clearly amused by the Labour leader's joke - a rare thing indeed - but her reply was pure government boilerplate, complete with a swipe at Labour's shifting position on Brexit.""Doesn’t the PM feel he could set the bar, just a little bit higher?” @jeremycorbyn asks @theresa_may who replies the Labour front bench ""can't even agree with themselves what their policy is"" #PMQs pic.twitter.com/1VaVxvUUHeEnd of Twitter post 2 by @daily_politicsMr Corbyn ploughed on with his attack on the government's apparent divisions over Brexit and tore into the PM over the protection of workers' rights and the environment. He claimed that the 62 Brexiteer Tories who sent her a letter setting what they wanted from Brexit were in favour of weakening protections.

Jeremy Corbyn mined a rich seam of quotes from ministers, producing laughs from his backbenchers, but nothing new from the prime minister.The interest in all this is less what was said and more whether it signals an evolution in Labour's Brexit strategy. The questions reflected Labour's long-standing rhetoric about a ""jobs-first Brexit."" But the time is coming when they will have to take a position on, for example, UK membership of ""a customs union,"" after Brexit. So were these questions an attempt to start reaching out to Europhile Tory backbenchers who might rebel on forthcoming amendments to the Trade Bill? Perhaps the divisions among Tory MPs have finally proved an irresistible target.Elsewhere the PM has being trying to find positive notes to strike - and she was prepared to engage in a positive way with questions from Labour's Chris Bryant on rehabilitation for spinal injuries and the Conservative Sir Mike Penning on the safety of medical treatments. The session also saw a series of long and vehement rebukes to noisy MPs from Mr Speaker - and a couple of direct slap-downs to SNP MPs. This is one of the most Speaker-intensive PMQs for quite a while, and it looks as if, in the wake of the various concerns about bullying in Westminster, John Bercow has decided to launch a bit of a clampdown,Jeremy Corbyn proves the foolishness of that Mad Max line from DD by using it in his first question.End of Twitter post  by @IsabelHardmanMay tells Paul Scully re EU citizens post-Brexit ""v imp point"" + they ""make huge contribution to our country"".

The BBC's Norman Smith said some of the document published by David Davis's Brexit department would make ""uncomfortable reading"" for Tory Brexiteers.It contains no ""pushback"" on EU demands for free movement of people to continue in the same form during the transition phase, no suggestion of a veto to block new EU laws and no power to implement new international trade deals without the EU's permission, he said.The document's publication comes after more than 60 Eurosceptic Tory MPs set out a list of Brexit demands for the prime minister - and a day before ministers meet at Chequers to try to thrash out a way forward.The EU has said the transition phase should end on 31 December, 2020, the end of its budget period.But in the UK's ""draft text for discussion"", it says the length ""should be determined simply by how long it will take to prepare and implement the new processes and new systems that will underpin the future partnership"".It adds: ""The UK agrees this points to a period of around two years, but wishes to discuss with the EU the assessment that supports its proposed end date.""Labour MP Chuka Umunna, of the pro-EU Open Britain campaign, said: ""It appears the government wants transition to last indefinitely - a never-ending road to nowhere because the cabinet can't agree on our future trading relationship with the EU"".Speaking on the BBC's Daily Politics, Brexit Minister Steve Baker said: ""I'd be quite happy for us to have the minimum period necessary to get out successfully into the new arrangements but that is a matter to negotiate with the European Commission.""You can see that they want us to exit at the end of the budget period (31 December, 2020) the prime minister is suggesting two years. But what will be the case is, when we've agreed, there will be a fixed date.""One area where the two sides have been expected to clash is citizens' rights, and whether people from the EU arriving in the UK during transition will have an unrestricted right to stay.The UK government has said such people should be treated differently to those who are already here before Brexit day - something the EU says it cannot accept.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the leak suggested the UK ""has softened its position"".Govt source accepts UK has softened its position on EU citizens being able to come and settle in UK after Brexit during transition period - faced EU brick wall altho PM has always said it had to be differentEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakShe added that the UK side thinks the positions are close:Belief in govt UK text and EU text side by side demonstrate not huge distance btw the two sides over the transition period - their political priority for March is getting that bit doneEnd of Twitter post 2 by @bbclaurakGiving evidence to a committee of MPs, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes stuck to the government's line, saying EU citizens would ""not be subject to the same rights"" once Brexit takes place in March 2019.""I think there's an important point that EU citizens who come here after we've left the EU will have done so knowing that we're leaving the European Union and will have different expectations to those who have been here for some time and are entitled to settled status,"" she said.The letter to Theresa May from 62 Tory MPs says the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"".  Earlier Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was time for Mrs May to spell out clearly what kind of relationship she wanted with the EU, accusing her of ""waffle and empty rhetoric"" on Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions.""Businesses need to know. People want to know. Even Tory backbenchers are demanding to know.""He suggested the PM had downgraded her negotiation goals from a tariff-free trade agreement to ""as much tariff-free trade as possible"".

In the last few days a number of Brexit supporters have suggested that the 1998 agreement may no longer be fit for purpose. ""I've seen it myself in the last day or two when I've said something about, maybe the Belfast Agreement could be refreshed and we could look at ways of, as if you're sort of, you know, I don't know, saying you want to kill all babies at birth or something,"" she said.The DUP and Sinn Féin have disagreed on whether or not a deal was on the table before talks collapsed.Broadcaster Eamonn Mallie has published 13 pages of a draft document on his website. Sinn Féin said it included an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act, and respecting language and diversity act.The DUP said the published papers did not ""undermine anything"" it had said.Mr Eastwood made comments about devolution during a meeting of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.In one exchange with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, he said: ""Everybody tells me that your party signed up to an Irish Language Act but it's for you to answer and it's for you to answer the people of Northern Ireland as to why we don't have a government. You and Sinn Féin.Mr Shannon replied: ""For the record Mr Chairman, we in the DUP did not agree to an Irish Language Act. ""Our party is very clear on that and for fear of any thoughts otherwise. I just want to put it on the record never, never, never, to use the words that were used yesterday in parliament.""Mr Eastwood said: ""I've heard 'never, never, never' before. ""And those things disappear like snow off a ditch when it's time to do government. ""In my view, from the people I have spoken to, and the papers I have read, you did agree to an Irish Language Act.""I know poor Mr Campbell (DUP MP Gregory Campbell) has had to go out and bat for that position for the past week and rarely do I feel sorry for Mr Campbell, but he's had a tough job over the last week defending that position.""The Foyle MLA repeated calls for a British Irish Inter-Governmental Conference to be reconvened with the British and Irish Governments putting their best guess of what a deal should be on the table.""It needs to happen urgently, because we have found in the last 13 months our institutions are very easy to pull down and not that easy to put back together again,"" he said.""Most people in this room remember the five years where we didn't have a government. I think we would be lucky to get these institutions back in five years. ""It is time for an intervention and the two governments have the responsibility to do that.""The leader of the Alliance Party, Naomi Long, pulled out of the hearing in protest at the decision to also invite the loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson to give evidence. Mr Bryson was a prominent campaigner during the union flag protests, which began in December 2012.At one point, Mr Bryson was asked by Labour MP John Grogan: ""You're on the fringe of Northern Ireland politics. Could you remind me - I think you've had some electoral adventures - what's the most votes that you've got?""Mr Bryson replied: ""I did stand for election before but to be clear... in 2011 when I think I was 21 it was 167 (votes) in a local council election.""The quota was about 350. I'm not sure how that's relevant to Unionist Voice Policies Studies which I'm here to represent. ""As you say, my view on Northern Ireland politics and the people I represent may not be a majority view but it is a view of a considerable amount of people within the unionist community who have felt left behind by the political process and all people like to engage in the political process. ""So I don't think it's fair to insinuate that because somebody does not have majority support behind them they cannot engage in the process.""During his evidence, Mr Bryson said the Belfast Agreement was a surrender to the violence of the IRA and a ""moral stain"" on the British parliament ."

Minette Batters, a beef farmer from Wiltshire, takes over from Meurig Raymond, who held the post for four years. She had just one opponent, Essex farmer Guy Smith, who will become her deputy. Ms Batters fought her campaign on championing the industry to those outside of the farming community and gaining certainty around Brexit. The NFU, which represents more than 50,000 farmers and growers in England and Wales, announced the result at its annual meeting in Birmingham.Ms Batters was brought up on a farm, but did not stand to inherit the tenancy for the land from her father.However, in 1998 she managed to convince the landlords that, in exchange for renovating two derelict cottages in the farmyard, she could take on the farm buildings and 300 acres. She told the Love British Food campaign that from starting with just 20 Simmental cross suckler cows, the business has grown to a herd of over 300 pedigree Hereford cattle, a small flock of pedigree sheep, fields and a converted Tythe barn wedding venue.She also runs a catering business specialising in home grown produce, and employs two full-time and up to 20 part-time staffMs Batters first got involved with the NFU locally, believing it was a way of ""driving change"". However, she said it was a gradual process to reach the position she has achieved, rather than an ambition. She told the campaign: ""I have to say I never planned to have a career in agricultural politics.""It's down to the encouragement and persuasion of other farmers that I am where I am today.""After becoming a grassroots member, she rose through the ranks to NFU county chairman, serving as Wiltshire's council delegate and also as regional board chairman for the South West.  She has also been a member of NFU Governance Board and the agricultural representative on the SW Environment Agency Flood and Coastal Committee.  Ms Batters has co-founded campaigns such as Ladies in Beef and the Great British Beef Week, and supported others, like Love British Food."

Save the Children said it had commissioned ""a root and branch review of the organisational culture"" at the charity ""addressing any behavioural challenges among senior leadership"".The charity said concerns were raised about ""inappropriate behaviour and comments"" by Mr Forsyth in 2015.It said two trustees carried out separate investigations into a total of three complaints made by female employees.""Both reviews resulted in unreserved apologies from the CEO. All the parties agreed to this and the former CEO apologised to the women in question. At that time the matters were closed.""A Unicef spokesman said: ""We welcome Mr Forsyth's decision to come forward and acknowledge past mistakes. ""We are discussing this matter with Mr Forsyth and his former employer so we can take appropriate action.""   An investigation by BBC Radio 4's PM programme, found the complaints against Mr Forsyth included women receiving a series of inappropriate texts, and comments on how they looked, what they were wearing and how he felt about them.If they did not respond, Mr Forsyth would follow up his messages with an email, asking if they had seen the text. If they still did not respond, he would ask someone to send them to him for a ""quick word"".A woman who complained at the time said the longer she was at the charity the more she was exposed to ""some of the bravado"". ""That is both at head office and in the field,"" she said.""Other women tell you to watch out for certain senior people. You start to hear rumours about some of the directors but of course until it happens to you - which it did - you don't really appreciate how hard it is to deal with."" She said it did not seem the complaints were being treated with the ""appropriate degree of seriousness"" and it was ""troubling"" that the then chairman of the charity's board of trustees, Sir Alan Parker, became involved. Sir Alan is the founder of the PR firm Brunswick.Another former employee of Save the Children told the BBC: ""The centre of this crisis was not in Haiti or Chad. It was in London. ""Young professional women at Save the Children felt unsafe. They felt that their careers could depend on ensuring they responded to unwanted attention and to bullying.""  In his statement, Mr Forsyth said he had made ""some personal mistakes during my time at Save the Children"".""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I now know caused offence and hurt. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved.

The MPs say the UK must not be stopped from negotiating trade deals with other countries, once it leaves the EU, and must gain full ""regulatory autonomy"".  The letter was sent by the European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Opposition critics accused the PM of being ""too weak"" to confront the ""hard Brexiteers"" in her own party.The letter, signed by 62 MPs including several ex-ministers and former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, includes a number of ""suggestions"" for securing a successful Brexit.It backs the PM's vision for Brexit, as set out in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017, including leaving the customs union and single market.But it says she ""must"" ensure the UK can change its laws without authorisation from the EU from the moment it leaves in March 2019.The MPs also insist the UK must be ""free to start its own trade negotiations"" during the planned two-year transition period that would kick in after Brexit day.And it urges the UK government to resist EU efforts to set the timetable for Brexit negotiations.""The UK should negotiate as an equal partner. Ministers may not want or be able to accept the EU's timing and mandates as fixed, and should be able to set out alternative terms including, for example, building an agreement based on our World Trade Organisation membership instead,"" says the letter.It comes ahead of a crunch cabinet meeting on Thursday to thrash out an agreement on how to proceed in negotiations with the EU.The government is also set to publish its its response to the EU's proposals for how the two-year transition period after Brexit should work later on Wednesday.The UK wants a mechanism to object to new European legislation introduced during the implementation phase.The prime minister had suggested that EU nationals who arrive during the transition period should not have the right to settle permanently in the UK. Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergWith no majority, she knows that she needs to keep the dozens and dozens of Brexit-backing Tory MPs broadly with her for her own government's survival.They have accepted some shifts from the government that they used to find intolerable - a Brexit departure lounge of a couple of years rather than a sharp exit, and a bill of tens of billions.But they are not, as this letter makes clear, up for swallowing many more compromises when it comes to getting trade deals done immediately after Brexit.Read Laura's full blogLabour claimed the MPs' letter ""exposes the deep divisions that run through the heart of this Tory government"". Shadow Brexit minister Paul Blomfield  said: ""It is clearer than ever that Theresa May cannot deliver the Brexit deal Britain needs.""She is too weak to face down the fanatics in her own party and to deliver a final deal that protects jobs and the economy.""The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""It is clear from this list of demands that the Tories don't want either a transition deal or a ‎future relationship with the EU.""Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said it appeared the prime minister had ""one arm tied behind her back by the Tory militants who are now nakedly acting like a party within a party"".In other Brexit news, a group of pro-Leave economists claim to have ""comprehensively debunked"" leaked government forecasts predicting a hit to the UK economy outside the EU.The Whitehall forecasts - which predicted lower growth across the UK as a result of Brexit - sparked a row when they emerged last month.Now Economists for Free Trade have published their ""alternative"" calculations, saying the civil servants' version ignored what they said were the ""clear objectives"" set out by Mrs May of free trade with Europe and the rest of the world.Using government models, this would suggest a 2% rise in GDP over 15 years, the group claimed.Mr Duncan Smith said the report ""deserves to be taken very seriously"".Mrs May is meeting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte for talks in Downing Street and is expected to update him on Brexit progress."

2018-02-21,Productivity growth strongest since 2008,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221165022/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43140646,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK has seen the strongest two quarters of productivity growth since the recession of 2008, according to the latest data.Output per hour rose 0.8% in the three months to December, the Office for National Statistics said. It follows growth of 0.9% in the previous period.There was also a better than expected rise in wages. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5% year-on-year.However, unemployment edged higher, but still remains low at 4.4%.The growth in productivity - as measured by the amount of work produced per working hour - will provide encouragement to policy makers who have wrestled with the challenge of low productivity growth since the financial crisis.The economy: Three better things, one worryUK economic growth exceeds forecastsThe ONS said the surprise rise in the unemployment rate raised the question of whether the UK's long run of falling unemployment might be over.The rise in wages still lags behind inflation which stood at 3% at the end of last year. So average pay has not increased in real terms. But a pick up in wage growth is another sign that the UK economy could be shifting tack.Economists suggest that the rise in wages is significant.Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG in the UK, said: ""There are signs that average weekly earnings, which rose by 2.5% in the fourth quarter, are beginning to respond to the tightness of the labour market, although households are still feeling the squeeze when accounting for inflation, with real earnings falling by 0.3%.""She also described the productivity figures as ""very encouraging"".""If stronger productivity continues into 2018, the Bank of England may decide to hold at least once on raising rates this year,"" she added.Earlier this month the Bank of England indicated that interest rates were likely to go up more quickly than previously expected if the economy remained on its current track. Economist predicted there might be a rate rise as early as May.The increase in unemployment for the three months to the end of December was the first rise in the jobless rate for two years. However, the total number of people in work also continued to rise, jumping by 88,000 in the same period. Some of that increase was due to people previously classed as inactive and not looking for work moving into the workforce or registering as unemployed.""There are mixed messages in the data we've had out this morning,"" says Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC.""You've got a big rise in unemployment, a big rise in employment and a big rise in the workforce. It's not clear any one of those in isolation is a start of a trend.Ms Martins said she expected the unemployment rate to continue to rise but that rising numbers out of work could be part of the explanation for increased productivity growth.""If GDP is growing more than the number of people working in it, then productivity will grow as there is more growth per head. ""It's not the nicest way to get productivity but it is effective as long as GDP growth doesn't slow too,"" she said. We used to take it for granted that we would each get better off as the economy grew. As companies and the government invested in better technology and skills, each worker could produce more goods or services per hour, bringing in more revenue to their employers - and as a result, each worker could be paid more per hour. Those improvements in productivity were for most of the last 200 years the motor of economic growth, so regular they could be taken for granted.In the past decade, that engine of improved prosperity broke down. By June 2017, the amount produced per hour was only 0.4 per cent larger than it had been nine years before. While we had had economic growth, most of it wasn't growth in the amount each worker produced or earned, but simply growth in the number of people working. Because an economy is simply people and their economic activity, when the number of people grows, so does the economy. But it may not be the sort of growth where individuals are getting better off. So used to the ""productivity puzzle"" have economists become that when the ONS estimated productivity growth of 0.9% in the third quarter of last year, many dismissed it as a blip. But now, with another estimate of 0.8 per cent in the final quarter, fewer are scoffing. Maybe that old motor has some life in it yet.  "

""I remember the nurse leaving - they call them pads but they are effectively adult nappies - on my bedside cabinet in the hospital ward,"" he said.""She went out of the room and I just remember lying there and I burst into tears.""When Mr Lewis was elected as Plaid AM for South Wales East in 2016, he became the youngest assembly member at 32.The AM, who previously worked as an adviser to party leader Leanne Wood, soon became Plaid's Brexit spokesman.He said his experience with the disease had confirmed his belief that it is possible to win in politics ""without having to bludgeon your opponents"". ""I still think if you can win an argument and inspire people and actually talk very little about your opponents, I think you can win.""He said the ""love and solidarity"" shown to him by members of all parties has been ""phenomenal"".It had shown, he said, that: ""Actually, politics aside, we are human beings who care for one another and when the chips are down we can be there for one another and be tidy to each other"".Wales Live, BBC One Wales, 1030 GMT"

The shadow home secretary also said the parents of child refugees who come to the UK should be allowed to join them.The Tories said this risked creating an increased incentive for children from war zones to try coming to the UK.In a speech to the Policy Institute in London, Ms Abbott said the ""right to a family life"" and the principle of family reunion would be at the heart of her party's ""humanistic"" approach to immigration policy after Brexit.""We don't want to see the break-up of families from the EU in the way we currently do for non-EU families.""She suggested her party's refusal to ""scapegoat"" immigrants had contributed to its gains in last year's election, contrasting Labour's rhetoric on the issue with that of other left-of-centre parties across Europe. She said it was ""not fair nor reasonable"" to separate children from their parents on immigration grounds or bar the parents and carers of children granted asylum or leave to remain in the UK from joining them.""This commitment underlines our commitment to human rights. This is the application of Labour values and it is the right thing to do,"" she said. As part of a proposed overhaul of deportation rules, she called for an end to situations where migrants and asylum seekers told they could not settle in the UK were forcibly returned to countries with which they had little connection. She also pledged to end the indefinite detention of asylum seekers and migrants and review the role of private companies in running holding and removal centres. She rejected suggestions Labour continued to support an open-door immigration policy, saying it backed ""sensible and humane"" controls that recognised that immigration was not always an ""unalloyed benefit"" and created pressures on public services in parts of the UK.Labour's approach, she argued, would not be based on numbers but a system of ""fair rules and reasonable management"", which prioritised the economy and jobs and ensured a level-playing field for migrants, wherever they originated from. She claimed the government's target of reducing annual net migration to below 100,000 was resulting in much-needed doctors and nurses from outside the EU being turned away and landlords and health professionals effectively being transformed into immigration enforcement officials. ""We won't have artificial targets or 'go home' vans,"" she said. ""In a global world, we need migration and migrants. They should not be subjected to a hostile environment.""A Conservative spokesman said the government was committed to giving a home to those ""most in need"" and that the UK had resettled 23,000 of the most vulnerable refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, including 9,000 children, over the past year. ""Labour's policy would risk breaking up families by creating a dangerous incentive for children to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean and on to the UK on their own,"" he said."

Sinn Féin is likely to tell Mrs May it will oppose any form of direct rule and call for the establishment of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference - which promotes co-operation on matters of mutual interest between the British and Irish governments.On Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley declined to immediately re-impose direct rule from Westminster.Sinn Féin and the DUP - Northern Ireland's two main parties - had been in negotiations to end a 13-month stalemate at Stormont.The devolved government collapsed in a row over a botched green energy scheme.Talks between the DUP and Sinn Féin collapsed last week, and the two sides blamed each other for an impasse over a proposed Irish language act. The parties still disagree on whether or not a draft agreement was on the table before the talks broke down. On Tuesday, parts of the draft agreement being worked on were leaked and published.These confirmed what had already been reported about a three-stranded approach to the language question -  which would have resulted in an Irish language act, an Ulster Scots act, and a so-called respecting language and diversity act.But there was a degree of ambiguity as to whether this had been fully signed off by all the parties.Meanwhile, on Wednesday morning, MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs committee will take evidence on the issue of devolution.They will hear from a range of witnesses including SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson.

2018-02-21,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221165022/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-21,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221165022/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43113714,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Cutting tuition fees for university students without changing anything else would make the system less progressive.Reality Check verdict: If no other parts of the system were changed, a simple cut in tuition fees would not help those lower-income graduates who would not repay their loans within 30 years and would help higher-income graduates who would repay them.  Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine.

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""

The Remainers Boris Johnson wanted to reach out to were waving 'Exit from Brexit' signs on the balcony of the building where he was to give his speech.Almost two years since the starting gun was fired on the referendum campaign, here was a message from one of the leading Leave figures to the other side: Brexit can't be stopped, but I understand your concerns and I promise there's nothing to fear. It was an attempt to bridge the divide and convince doubters of the merits of Brexit. This was a return to his key campaign themes - taking back control of laws, embracing the world beyond Europe - in a speech heavy on rhetoric. But if the foreign secretary's aim was to heal divisions, the response only served to reveal how entrenched both sides still are. Brexiteers largely welcomed it as a rousing and optimistic outline of what lies ahead for post-Brexit Britain, while those in the pro-EU camp scoffed at the reassurance. The speech was billed by Downing Street as the first in the series to be given by senior cabinet ministers which would flesh out the government's Brexit plans in the coming weeks. But this was Boris Johnson once again sketching out a rough outline of a big picture - notably light on detail. Downing Street had dubbed this the beginning of the ""road map to Brexit"" - but the Cabinet are not yet closer to agreeing on the desired destination. Boris Johnson once again made clear his opposition to sticking closely to the EU after Brexit as some of his colleagues wish to - warning it would be ""mad"" to go through all this upheaval if we weren't going to fully take advantage of the possible freedoms. Continuing to follow Brussels' rules would be ""intolerable"", he said. Though there was much concurring with what Theresa May has said on Brexit so far - no Boris going off message as he often has in the past - when it comes to the Brexit road ahead, we are no clearer on the government's direction of travel."

The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-21,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180221165022/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-22,May holds crunch Brexit talks at Chequers,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43136076,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May and her senior ministers are meeting at the PM's country retreat in the latest attempt to settle the government's approach to Brexit.The group of 11 are at Chequers to decide how closely the EU and UK should align after exit day in March 2019.There have been clear differences between ministers over the way forward - but Cabinet Minister David Lidington said he did not foresee a problem.It is thought the meeting could continue late into the evening.The Brexit sub committee includes key figures like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who were on opposite sides of the EU referendum argument in 2016. Mrs May will be hoping to secure sign-off for a key Brexit speech she is expected to give in the next month.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington insisted the gathering was one of ""a whole number of meetings"" on Brexit, adding: ""All of us in Cabinet are determined to get the best possible deal for every part of the United Kingdom.""BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth said Mrs May will ""lay out more detail of her vision, hopefully to answer the call for clarity that has been growing"" in a speech expected next week.""But first she needs to get her top team to agree to compromise.""As well as finding agreement within her government, the prime minister will need to convince the EU of her approach.Documents released on the eve of the Chequers gathering suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from.Slides published online by the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market.But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"".By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorIt is safe to say that the differences in the cabinet are real, if not as dramatic and dastardly - or indeed as straightforward - as portrayed.It is, therefore, also safe to say that getting to a clear, detailed and bold picture after months of tensions, in one day, is unlikely if not impossible.And if very much is to move forward and be agreed it will either require, as one minister gently lamented, ""the PM to actually make a decision"", overtly, on her own position and force others along - or for others to budge.One former minister described the situation as this: ""If everyone is happy it's a fudge. If anything's genuinely decided someone has to be unhappy.""Either Philip Hammond has to agree that he is signed up to divergence, or Boris Johnson has to agree that he can accept alignment, or, someone resigns.""Number 10 would, of course, not agree with that characterisation.Read Laura's full blog on the Chequers meetingBefore the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated.On Wednesday the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work.The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission.It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"".No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years.But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra £4bn-£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020.He said that the current £35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU  budget period at the end of 2020.For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations.Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe.Amnesty International is claiming the government's key EU (Withdrawal) Bill could ""significantly reduce existing human rights protections"" in the UK.In its annual report, Amnesty pointed to the decision to exclude the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights from the bill, which translates EU legislation onto the UK statute book.The UK government has said human rights will not be jeopardised by Brexit, saying protections in the EU charter will be covered by domestic law.The Wellcome Trust - one of the biggest voices of sciences in the UK - has also weighed into the debate, urging continued collaboration between scientists in the UK and Europe, saying ""excellent science is critical to the future of this country"".Former MI5 boss Eliza Manningham-Buller, now chair of the Wellcome Trust, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Over the history of the EU, collaboration between this country and the countries of the EU has been extensive. It's delivered fantastic results for society, for health and for our economies.""Collaboration comes best with close alignment because science is never done in isolation. Collaboration also comes from harmonising regulation. Regulation in this area protects privacy - patient data - it protects patients - patient safety. It protects the use of animals in research."""
2018-02-22,"UK net migration falls to 244,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43154308,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September, figures show.But 220,000 EU nationals still moved to Britain over the same period, the Office for National Statistics found.That is 47,000 fewer than the previous year.It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years.The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK.Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"".Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons.""By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014.Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed.This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years.   BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected.He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU.Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period.This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving.The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos.By home affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000.  But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000.  At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe.Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said.Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.You might also be interested in:Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said net migration was still double the government's target and accused the Home Office of turning away qualified doctors despite a recruitment shortage in the NHS.""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said.The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18.Separate figures from the Home Office showed more than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme.Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020.Other figures from the Home Office show there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year.This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.   "

""If it does not, we will expect to hold a further evidence session, where you will be required to provide a very much more convincing case for the continued operation of this MoU than has been presented so far.""NHS Digital is required by law to co-operate with the Home Office but it retains the right under the MoU to seek more information about requests for data and turn them down if ""not satisfied that request is in the public interest"". Dr Wollaston said in her letter: ""We do not believe that NHS Digital has fully considered and appropriately taken account of the public interest in maintaining a confidential medical service.""Launching the consultation, the Department of Health said there was evidence that ""fear of deportation is a barrier to seeking care"". But it added: ""There is currently however much less evidence about the impact of data-sharing arrangements and specific knowledge of those arrangements on deterring undocumented immigrants from seeking healthcare and treatment.""As a result, it has asked Public Health England to ""undertake a review within two years of the impact on public health and health-seeking behaviour arising from the disclosure of personal data in relation to the investigation of criminal offences, including immigration offences"". Submissions to the review should be sent by 30 March."

That link has now been seemingly broken.""Mr McDonnell said: ""Seven years of Tory austerity have dragged our public services to an existential crisis - the figures for local government are genuinely shocking.""He urged Chancellor Philip Hammond to use his Spring Statement next month to bring forward the funding needed ""to place our local authorities on to a sustainable financial footing, for at least the next year"".A Labour government would restore funding to public services, with a £21bn pledge over the Parliament to address cuts made to the Work and Pensions budget, including £3bn a year for universal credit, he said.""We will do so through making sure a fair rate of taxation is paid by those wealthy people and businesses that can afford it,"" Mr McDonnell said.""We will also do so by making sure corporations and the wealthy pay their taxes.""He said falling productivity was a direct result of a failure to invest. And cheap, insecure work had replaced investment in the capital, skills and technology ""that can create decent jobs for the future"".In a question-and-answer session following his speech, Mr McDonnell was asked about newspaper claims about Cold War meetings with spies.He said he had been a council officer in Camden at the time.

The parties still disagree on whether or not a draft agreement was on the table before the talks broke down. Baroness Paisley said the DUP needed to accept responsibility over the energy scheme that led to the collapse of government.DUP leader Arlene Foster was the minister in charge of the Stormont department that ran the scheme.""If you are a minister and someone in your department is wrong, the buck stops at your desk,"" said Baroness Paisley.""You have got to do what is right and stand down from your position until the matter is sorted out.""If that had been done at the beginning, there would have been a very different situation that the one we are in at the minute. ""We would not be in the mess we are in.""She said politicians should cut out the ""nonsense and lies and start anew"".""If they had followed the example that the late Martin McGuinness and my husband set for them, this would not have happened,"" she said.""They would not have got into this mess in the first place.""Baroness Paisley said politicians were ""hiding from the truth"" and people in Northern Ireland needed ""proper government"".

He told the BBC that he was ready to give Ofwat new powers. Mr Gove said concerns were ""not a chimaera"" and would be taken seriously.The privatised water companies have come under attack in recent years after studies revealed they had increased their levels of debt and paid out big dividends to shareholders. Water bills set to fall from 2020Bank left Thames Water with £2bn debtThames Water fined £8.5m for leaksA study by the University of Greenwich found the companies had earned about £18bn in pre-tax profits over the past decade, and paid out about the same amount in shareholders. Water prices have outstripped inflation by 36% since privatisation, Ofwat figures show.Sir Ian Byatt, the first chief executive of Ofwat, said if he were still in the job he would insist on an immediate 10% cut in prices. He said the regulator also needed to bring in a form of dividend cap, where if payouts to shareholders became too great, prices would be cut accordingly. That would ensure the benefits of privatisation were ""shared with customers, not just financiers,"" he said.At the same time there has been concern over action on leakages and pollution, particularly at Thames Water, which serves one-quarter of the population. It has been handed a heavy fine for polluting the Thames, and been criticised for issuing nearly £2bn worth of dividends in the past decade, the payment of little corporation tax and the use of subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands, a tax haven.Thames Water has recently cancelled its dividend and said it would scrap the Caymans' companies. Steve Robertson, the chief executive, said criticism of the payments overlooked the industry's strong record of investment, with, he claimed had resulted in £10 of investment in infrastructure for every £1 paid to shareholders. ""The debate around nationalisation is getting bogged down in dogma, ideology, and not focussing on outcomes,"" he said.Mr Gove's promise of more powers for the regulator relies on Ofwat asking for them. Rachel Fletcher, Ofwat's chief executive, said a dividend cap was not in its current thinking, nor direct action on executive pay or tax structures. Instead, she said, Ofwat would require water companies to provide more public information on each of the areas of concern.You can download the podcast of Dominic's full report on the Today programme here."
2018-02-22,UK economic growth revised downwards,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43154467,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK economy expanded by less than previously thought in the last three months of 2017, official figures say.GDP grew by 0.4% in the October-to-December period, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, down from the initial estimate of 0.5%.The revision was due to slower growth in production industries, the ONS said. In 2017 as a whole, the economy grew by 1.7%, also slightly lower than previously thought and the weakest since 2012.The ONS had previously estimated that the economy grew by 1.8% last year.The statistics body said that household spending grew by 1.8% last year, also the slowest annual rate since 2012. It said the slowdown was partly because of shoppers facing higher prices in stores.""A number of very small revisions to mining, energy generation and service were enough to see a slight downward revision to quarterly growth overall,"" said ONS statistician Darren Morgan.One drag on the UK economy at the end of last year was the shutdown of the Forties pipeline system for a large part of December 2017.The closure of one of the UK's most important oil pipelines cost about £20m a day in lost activity, according to Oil and Gas UK.Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said that some areas of the UK economy looked ""worryingly weak"" in the final months of last year.The data suggested the construction industry is in recession, business investment was stagnant and household spending was seeing only ""modest"" growth, he said.Households have been squeezed by rising inflation coinciding with weak wage growth.John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said that would hold back growth this year to 1.5%.""This would not be disastrous by any means, but would place us towards the bottom of the G7 growth league table together with Italy and Japan, rather than at the top with Germany and the US.The UK's year-on-year growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 1.4%, making it the slowest growing of the world's wealthy nations (comparable figures for Canada are not yet available). The UK is also growing more slowly than the eurozone. The Bank of England is a bit more optimistic about growth prospects.Last month, it raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November.At the time, the Bank indicated that the pace of interest rate increases in the UK could accelerate if the economy remained on its current track.One nagging problem for the UK has been a lack of productivity growth since the financial crisis of 2007.But on Tuesday, official data showed signs of improvement.Output per hour rose 0.8% in the three months to December, the Office for National Statistics said. It follows growth of 0.9% in the previous period.That was the the strongest two-quarter period of productivity growth since the recession of 2008.There was also a better-than-expected rise in wages. Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5% year-on-year.Unemployment edged higher at the end of last year, but still remains low at 4.4%."

Jeremy Corbyn mined a rich seam of quotes from ministers, producing laughs from his backbenchers, but nothing new from the prime minister.The interest in all this is less what was said and more whether it signals an evolution in Labour's Brexit strategy. The questions reflected Labour's long-standing rhetoric about a ""jobs-first Brexit."" But the time is coming when they will have to take a position on, for example, UK membership of ""a customs union,"" after Brexit. So were these questions an attempt to start reaching out to Europhile Tory backbenchers who might rebel on forthcoming amendments to the Trade Bill? Perhaps the divisions among Tory MPs have finally proved an irresistible target.Elsewhere the PM has being trying to find positive notes to strike - and she was prepared to engage in a positive way with questions from Labour's Chris Bryant on rehabilitation for spinal injuries and the Conservative Sir Mike Penning on the safety of medical treatments. The session also saw a series of long and vehement rebukes to noisy MPs from Mr Speaker - and a couple of direct slap-downs to SNP MPs. This is one of the most Speaker-intensive PMQs for quite a while, and it looks as if, in the wake of the various concerns about bullying in Westminster, John Bercow has decided to launch a bit of a clampdown,Jeremy Corbyn proves the foolishness of that Mad Max line from DD by using it in his first question.End of Twitter post  by @IsabelHardmanMay tells Paul Scully re EU citizens post-Brexit ""v imp point"" + they ""make huge contribution to our country"".

Asked to describe the then backbench MP's relationship with the Czech secret police, the StB, Mr Sarkocy told BBC News: ""It's very hard to say, but he was open.""Pressed on whether Mr Corbyn knew Mr Sarkocy was a member of the secret police, he said: ""Yeah, absolutely, because at the time, you know, everyone knew who is who at the Embassy.""Mr Sarkocy, who was interviewed by the BBC in Bratislava, Slovakia, described Mr Corbyn as a ""very, very good source"".Mr Corbyn's spokesman said the Labour leader recalled one meeting with an unnamed Czech diplomat to discuss disarmament in the 1980s but disputed other reported encounters, accusing Mr Sarkocy of making a series of outlandish claims. He said claims he was ""sympathetic"" to the Soviet-backed Czechoslovak regime were false.Mr Corbyn has suggested a series of front page headlines over the past week about his contacts with Mr Sarkocy, who worked in the Czechoslovak embassy in London in the 1980s, were politically motivated.In a Facebook message on Tuesday, he suggested that the coverage, based on a file which the Communist-era Czech intelligence agency compiled on Mr Corbyn, was driven by right-wing newspaper owners who were ""worried"" about the prospect of a Labour government.The director of the Czech Security Service Archive has said the files suggest Mr Corbyn was seen as a possible ""contact"" for the authorities but there was no evidence to suggest he was an informant or collaborator. The body which runs the archives of the former East Germany's secret police, the Stasi, said it had not found ""any records"" on the Labour leader in ""recent searches"". The Federal Commissioner for the Stasi records has now scotched press speculation that the much-feared secret police compiled a dossier on Mr Corbyn after he toured the country with his then girlfriend - Labour MP and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott - in the 1970s.In a statement, the Federal Commissioner said: ""The most recent researches in the written records of the Ministry for State Security of East Germany have not produced any records or any other information on Jeremy Corbyn or Diane Abbott.""It has been reported that East German agents targeted left-wing politicians and groups, infiltrating Labour Action for Peace, a group in which Mr Corbyn was active in during the 1980s. Speaking after Prime Minister's Questions, a Labour spokesman said there was nothing to indicate that Mr Corbyn had been aware of this.More broadly, he said the press had had ""creative fun"" with the spy stories but the claims were based on a single source and had been denied by the Czech intelligence archives.Mr Corbyn, who is said to have ""good records"" of his contacts from the period, remembered meeting one Czechoslovak official to discuss the prospect for peace and disarmament, a discussion that took place at a time when there were growing hopes of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States. The Labour leader was ""not embarrassed"" to have met a wide range of people from both Warsaw Pact and Nato countries during the Cold War, his spokesman said, but some of the alleged meetings were ""demonstrably false"".The MP, he said, had been at a socialist conference in Chesterfield on 24 October 1987, one of the dates in which he was reported to have met Mr Sarkocy.The Labour leader, meanwhile, has called on Tory MP Ben Bradley to apologise or face legal action for a post on Twitter in which he claimed Mr Corbyn had ""sold British secrets to Communist spies"". Mr Corbyn's lawyers have sent a letter to the Mansfield MP urging him to confirm in writing that the ""defamatory statement"" - which they say is damaging and potentially harmful to the Labour leader's reputation - will not be repeated in any form.Mr Bradley, who had already deleted the tweet following criticism on social media, is also being urged to make a donation to a charity of Jeremy Corbyn's choice ""in lieu of damages""."

Decisions made in London and Brussels will have profound consequences for the 250,000 people who live in the UK's 14 overseas territories - yet another thread of complexity in the Brexit process.Gibraltar has always had the potential to cause a Brexit bust-up, even though Article 50 is perhaps less important here than Article 10... of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.That was when Spain ceded sovereignty of the Rock to Britain - a decision it appears to have regretted ever since.Gibraltar voted 96% in favour of remaining in the EU. There was enormous shock in the territory when the UK voted to leave, taking Gibraltar with it.""The atmosphere of disaster and grief was absolutely palpable,"" recalls Marlene Hassan Nahon, an independent member of the Gibraltar parliament.""One of my good friends met me for breakfast. She was dressed in a black dress, crying her eyes out.""Britain's Overseas TerritoriesLocal businesses are beginning to get more used to the idea of operating outside the single market, especially after the government of Gibraltar revealed that roughly 90% of its financial services trade within the single market is actually with the UK.""Somehow we had not realised or considered it before,"" says Joe Garcia, a veteran local journalist who has been covering all things Gibraltar since the 1960s.""People who bet online in Britain, 60% of those bets actually come through Gibraltar, and it's the same with requests for car insurance. When you are out in Britain, look around. One out of every six cars is insured in Gibraltar.""But many of the people who work in the sector live across the border in Spain. And there are persistent fears about the potential for long delays at the border after Brexit, and about the future of the Rock's low tax regime, which Spain sees as unfair competition. ""They will probably try to use [Brexit] to get Gibraltar to stop being what they call a tax haven,"" says Spanish historian Mercedes Penalba-Sotorrio. ""I think one of the main priorities is to stop that.""But the most sensitive issue is Spain's long-standing claim for sovereignty - shared or otherwise - which is rejected outright by both the UK and Gibraltar itself.Suspicion was heightened after the remaining EU27 decided formally that no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without a bilateral agreement between Spain and the UK.Now that language is threatening to complicate negotiations on a transition period for the UK after Brexit.""To the frustration of Brussels and the rest of the EU,"" says Mujtaba Rahman of the political consultancy Eurasia Group, ""Madrid is now arguing that the transition represents one such agreement - and that the transition should not apply to Gibraltar unless Spain explicitly agrees, which it currently does not.""If Gibraltar feels under threat, at least it has some influential supporters in London. Last year The Sun updated its classic early 90s headline ""Up Yours Delors"" for the front-page benefit of Spain: ""Up Yours Senors"".But spare a thought for Britain's overseas territories with rather less clout. The Caribbean island of Anguilla has a sea border with the EU, and is fearful of the future. Devastated by Hurricane Irma last year, and dependent on neighbouring islands, it is now bracing for Brexit.Anguilla's closest gateway to the world lies four miles across the sea in the French half of the island of St Martin, which is officially part of France, and therefore an ""outermost region"" of the EU. Anguilla relies on access to St Martin for many of its daily necessities - from food supplies to MRI scans to the postal service. The nearest international airport lies on the Dutch side of St Martin. ""We have a symbiotic relationship, and we really don't want Brexit to change it,"" says Blondel Cluff, the Anguillan government representative in London. ""But I don't think we've come up in the negotiations yet."" In a report published last year entitled ""Anguilla & Brexit: Britain's forgotten EU border"", the Anguillan government called for a regional customs union with St Martin and a common travel area. Anguilla is also mostly ineligible for British development aid, and is therefore highly dependent on money coming from the EU for more than a third of its budget.""I know it's difficult when we have a population the size of a British village,"" says Blondel Cluff, ""but we need to make sure we don't get forgotten in the mix."" It all means that even half way round the world Brexit is raising concerns about the freedom of movement of goods, of services, and of course of people. ""The fact that people in overseas territories are going to lose an important element of their citizenship, without having been asked about it, may well give rise to legal challenges in the future,"" says Susie Alegre, a lawyer specialising in the rights of citizens in the British Overseas Territories.Given the bewildering range of Brexit issues that need to be resolved, it is hardly surprising that the overseas territories have not received the attention they feel they deserve. But Susie Alegre believes that could change. ""It may well be - and particularly with the case of Gibraltar - that in the next year you'll suddenly see quite serious issues popping up out of these dots on the map."""

2018-02-22,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-22,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43113714,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Cutting tuition fees for university students without changing anything else would make the system less progressive.Reality Check verdict: If no other parts of the system were changed, a simple cut in tuition fees would not help those lower-income graduates who would not repay their loans within 30 years and would help higher-income graduates who would repay them.  Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

My mother would have probably thought it was a difficult, unhappy choice for me to make. Actually I've been very happy. I've had a full life.""Ms Hosking has been in a relationship for 20 years, and chose to come out while writing her memoirs: Exceeding My Brief: Memoirs of a Disobedient Civil Servant.""Men had this great liberating moment when the law changed and they were no longer in danger of being imprisoned or, in earlier days, of being killed.""Women have never had that, but it has been extremely difficult because you could be ostracised very easily.""Ms Hosking moved to London from Cornwall at the age of 21 to pursue a career in journalism.Instead, she joined the Labour Party press office and went on to work for the civil service as a press officer to prime ministers Edward Heath and Harold Wilson.  Despite her Labour background  - she once considered running as an MP - Ms Hosking has some sympathy for Theresa May's current predicament.""She would be a marvellous 'good weather' prime minister with a big majority, but she doesn't have the equipment to cope with what is happening now.""It's a dreadful position for any prime minister to be in, with a divided cabinet and divided MPs behind her.""It's sad because she's got lots of good qualities, but she lacks the killer instinct for doing something. It may be that she looks around and feels she can't.""She believes potential Conservative leadership rivals are ""watching her suffer and watching her cope because they don't want to go in at this stage"".As someone who once discovered that her deputy was being paid more than she was, Ms Hosking says she's dismayed that women are still battling for equal pay.""I find it shocking. What's so difficult about equal pay? It's not happening in a lot of places. Don't tell me that it's accidental that in senior jobs in the BBC, the women are always getting less pay. Is this an accident? It can't be. And it can be solved.""She also fears that Labour's failure to elect a female leader is a symptom of a misogyny problem which the party ""has never lost"".Despite all this, Ms Hosking believes women ""have more freedom to choose to be themselves than at any point in history"".She remembers women being invited to leave the room following a high-level dinner in Brussels.""I said 'I'm very sorry I must go back. I'm with my minister, I'm his private secretary'. They said: 'You can't do that, the ladies retire so the men can discuss'. I said: 'He won't be able to get on without me, I've done all the work on this!' They said I would be the talk of Brussels the following day.""She's hopeful that the #metoo movement will be a turning point for how women are treated: ""It may change the culture, but that's a very difficult thing to do.""Usually in the past it's been something you put up with and you got on with it. You slapped them on the hand or gave them a good push. I suppose you could even knee them if it came to it!""She talks too of her sadness over Brexit, having been with Edward Heath when he signed the Treaty of Rome: ""I am a total Remainer. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. We have done worse than that.""People wanted change. It was an easy whipping boy to blame immigration, or to blame Europe, as if we weren't part of Europe.""And Ms Hosking revealed the secret of her longevity - a daily dose of red wine.

He's one of five former cabinet secretaries to speak to BBC Parliament about working inside No 10 Downing Street  - the scary moments, cabinet splits and the occasional lighter side of life.As the title suggests, the job does involve acting as secretary to the cabinet, preparing the agenda for meetings and taking notes.  The more challenging aspect of the cabinet secretary's role is to advise - and sometimes soothe - the prime minister of the day. ""You had to keep your head,"" said Robert, now Lord Armstrong, who worked for the former Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.  ""The pressure was intense and continuous.""  Between them, the five cabinet secretaries who spoke to Sue Cameron for BBC Parliament span over 30 years of British political life. Some issues, though, never seem to go away.Andrew Turnbull recalled how John Major, Conservative Prime Minister in the 1990s, had a ""very difficult time with the Eurosceptics, the bastards as he called them"".As Theresa May tries to bring her cabinet together on Brexit, Lord Turnbull has some advice - set out the position, explain why it's best for the UK and tell ministers who are not prepared to sign up to leave the cabinet.""That moment's got to come and it's a very, very difficult moment on top of all sorts of other problems,"" Lord Turnbull said.Lord Armstrong isn't impressed with the current cabinet set-up, saying: ""I think it's terribly disorderly isn't it? It creates such a bad impression, not only in this country but in Europe. They don't know where we stand because of the inability of cabinet ministers to have a line and stick to it.""Meanwhile Robin Butler, cabinet secretary to John Major and briefly to Tony Blair, has some sympathy for Mrs May. ""I feel sorry for Theresa May. I feel that everything that can go wrong for the government does seem to go wrong for it.""In his view, at each step of the Brexit negotiations Mrs May has been persuading the ""various camps"" within the cabinet to be ""realistic"" and take the necessary steps to make the negotiations a success.""She's being successful in that and I don't think she could do anything else,"" he concluded.One infamous cabinet 'split' was the fractured relationship between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when Labour came to power in 1997. Lord Turnbull, who was cabinet secretary to Mr Blair, called it ""very wearing"" for both of them and recalled how things got harder in the second term of the Labour government. He said: ""Whereas they had largely divided up the subjects between them in their first term - there were what we used to call Tony's subjects and Gordon's subjects - then, second term, particularly on something like health, they were both competing on the same ground.""I think it exhausted the pair of them."" Gordon Brown wasn't the only source of frustration for Tony Blair during his premiership.One of his cabinet secretaries, Richard Wilson, told BBC Parliament: ""I remember him saying to me 'I feel as though I'm sitting in a Rolls Royce and I don't know how to make it move'.""Lord Wilson wrote four memos on how to get the best out of the government machine, including advice to avoid following the ""Napoleonic model of government"".It was a criticism that Gordon Brown was keen to avoid at the start of his prime ministerial watch.  But did he take it too far?Gus O'Donnell recalled that at Gordon Brown's first cabinet meeting in 2007 every minister was encouraged to express a view on a range of subjects.It slowed things down so much that Lord O'Donnell felt moved to scribble a note to Mr Brown along the lines of: ""prime minister if we carry on like this we'll be here until midnight"".That was a lighter moment compared to what Lord O'Donnell called the ""incredibly scary"" financial crisis of 2008, as the government tried to ""stop the crisis from being a complete meltdown"".He said: ""Alistair Darling, as chancellor, was having the meeting with all the chairmen of the big banks and it wasn't just that one of them was going to be broke. None of them could have opened on that Monday morning without help from the Bank of England.""The government bailed out the banks to the tune of £500bn.An even darker day was 11 September 2001 - the terror attacks in the United States. Amid fears of coordinated attacks around the world, Lord Wilson, cabinet secretary to Tony Blair, recalled:  ""I had images of a plane flying into Big Ben or down into Buckingham Palace."" He can remember, in detail, the somewhat farcical elements to that tragic day.He decided to activate a new team set up to handle civil contingencies but they were on a ""bonding"" exercise in Yorkshire.  It then turned out that the civil servants with the keys to the emergency Whitehall meeting room were en route to an away-day in Herefordshire. Lord Wilson's thoughts turned to evacuation. One option was the tunnels that run under Whitehall.  But there was a problem.""The man who had the key to the tunnel was on holiday and nobody knew where he'd put the key,"" Lord Wilson revealed.There were decisions to be made: closing small airfields, heightening security at Heathrow and shutting the City of London airport.""'Close it down', I said, with authority which I really didn't address at the time. I was just concerned to make sure London was safe and that we looked after the people,"" recalled Lord Wilson.  ""It was only afterwards that I thought: 'What have I been doing?'"""
2018-02-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020. The UK does not agree with all the EU's proposals.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. But before going into any more detail, let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3.1% - the highest for nearly six years - but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 42 year low of 4.3%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it had been called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each set to play roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - a number of UK and EU figures back the idea of having a ""transition"" period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators will, to some extent, be making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.As mentioned already, there has now been agreement on the three 'separation issues' of the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU; the 'divorce bill' the UK pays the EU and also arrangements for the Northern Ireland border. Talks are now on future relations, including trade, between the UK and EU after Brexit. These talks are likely to focus on the terms for a 'transition period' of around two years to smooth the change in relations.Prime Minister Theresa May says leaving the EU with no deal whatsoever would be better than signing the UK up to a bad one. Without an agreement on trade, the UK would have to operate under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanThe agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of the three EEA countries and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.It's worth saying that even if no deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit. It is also worth saying that we don't yet know what rights there will be in future for EU people who want to move to the UK after March 2019 and for British people wanting to move and live in the EU.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of up to three years. However they will have to register. A permanent proposal for post-Brexit immigration is not likely to be known for a few months yet, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK have found their pounds are buying fewer euros or dollars after the Brexit vote. Even if the pound regains some of its value, currency experts expect it in the longer term to remain at least 10% below where it was when the referendum happened. This means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper, but imported goods will get more expensive - some price rises for food, clothing and homeware goods have been seen. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May has said one of the main messages she has taken from the Leave vote is that the British people want to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed significantly since the Brexit vote. This has largely been driven by an increase in emigration from the UK by citizens of Poland and the other East and Central European countries. There were still 230,000 more people coming to live in the UK than leaving in the year to June 2017, according to the latest estimates - still way above the government's target of 100,000 but 80,000 below the previous year. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems highly unlikely. Both the Conservatives and the Labour Party have ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was  proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one. Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM however when enought Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which means that any Brexit deal can become law only if MPs have voted for it. The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in last year's referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides agreed they did not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky.What has been agreed is that the UK 'will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the figure has been thought likely to be one of up to 50bn euros (£44bn). We don't yet know over how many years that will be or what exactly it would include and Downing Street says they are confident it will end up being below £40bn.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.During the referendum campaign, David Cameron said the so-called ""triple lock"" for state pensions would be threatened by a UK exit. This is the agreement by which pensions increase by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest. Theresa May had proposed ditching the 2.5% part of the lock in the party's election manifesto, but as part of the post-election deal with the DUP the triple lock was again guaranteed.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.Could the necessary legislation pass the Commons, given that a lot of MPs in the current Parliament - all SNP and Lib Dems, nearly all Labour and many Conservatives - were in favour of staying? The referendum result is not legally binding - Parliament still has to pass the laws that will get Britain out of the 28 nation bloc, starting with the repeal of the 1972 European Communities Act. The withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament - the House of Lords and/or the Commons could vote against ratification, according to a House of Commons library report.So in theory they could block the UK's EU exit. But in practice that is seen as very unlikely given that a majority of people voted for Brexit in the referendum.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU, as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Martin, from Poole, in Dorset, wanted to know what taxpayers would have got back from the benefit curbs negotiated by David Cameron in Brussels. We don't exactly know because the details were never worked out. HM Revenue and Customs suggested about 20,000 EU nationals receive child benefit payments in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin at an estimated cost of about £30m. But the total saving would have been significantly less than that because Mr Cameron did not get the blanket ban he wanted. Instead, payments would have been linked to the cost of living in the countries where the children live. David Cameron said as many as 40% of EU migrant families who come to Britain could lose an average of £6,000 a year of in-work benefits when his ""emergency brake"" was applied. The DWP estimated between 128,700 and 155,100 people would be affected. But the cuts would have been phased in. New arrivals would not have got tax credits and other in-work benefits straight away but would have gradually gained access to them over a four year period at a rate that had not been decided. The plan will never be implemented now.Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 8.2% at the time of the referendum in June 2016, to 4.5% in October 2017.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The BBC's Kevin Connolly says:The issue of free movement - the rights of EU citizens to live and work in the UK - was a huge issue in the Brexit referendum of course, and will be a big part of the exit negotiations. We've heard quite a bit from the British side already with the government saying that securing the status and rights of EU nationals in the UK and UK nationals in the EU is one of the government's earliest priorities, and specifically that it is looking for a reciprocal deal.So you might feel the mood music is encouraging but all we can say for sure is that, while there are no guarantees yet, it will be a big part of the Brexit negotiations to come.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith says:The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one sort of unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. Kevin Connolly says:At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire. That's what happened, I seem to remember, when the UK joined the EU. Anything else would be expensive and risk flooding the system, after all. The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.Kevin Connolly says:Two different courts here of course, so two different bits of politics. Crucially, the European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.Kevin Connolly says:As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.One bit of good news is that the UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.That matters because in the period when the UK is negotiating a new trade deal with the EU, and that could take years, trade would be conducted under WTO rules.At the moment, for non-food items, that implies an average tariff of about 2.3%.But suppose the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, for example. Well, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.In theory, an economist would say that creates a situation where everyone has an incentive to sort out a better deal for their consumers.The snag is that these things take years, if not decades. They tend to be done on a country-by-country and sector-by-sector basis.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then I'm afraid he's going to have to be patient.Maybe very, very patient.Norman Smith says:There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.My take is that not much is probably going to change.I say that because the UK'll still be a member of significant organisations such as the UN and Nato, and will still be co-operating with EU partners. For example, there will still be close ties on defence with the French.The UK will still be the same old Britain, will still have significant military force, will still be a wealthy country and will still be a nuclear power, so I don't think people will suddenly think the UK's an entirely different country.Kevin Connolly says:Funnily enough, I was discussing this question just the other day with a French politician, a conservative and a real Europhile, and he said he thought if there was a free vote in France tomorrow, as the right wing National Front would like, that the French would vote to leave.But generally speaking I can't see much prospect of a tidal wave of insurrectionist, exitism sweeping the continent. When a country like Ireland has a spat with the EU about tax, for example, it does annoy Irish politicians, but most mainstream leaders in the Europe have grown up with the idea that the EU has brought peace and prosperity for decades.Lots of them see plenty that irritates them about the European Union, but they mainly argue that the benefits hugely outweigh the irritations. And in countries where you do find Euroscepticism, such as Poland and Hungary, there is also a healthy awareness that there are huge financial benefits to membership.As for the future, we will see. If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, I think it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Britain could perhaps join the Free Trade Association along with Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland. But of course it would be joining under existing rules, so the likeliest future for a post-Brexit UK, I think, is a future where it tries to do the best deal possible with the EU and then looks around for other free trade deals.But that would fall short of creating a free trade area based on the UK itself.Kevin Connolly says:I think the question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said in September the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.For those of us for whom Northern Ireland is home, the total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.Conservative leader Theresa May has said we don't see a return to the borders of the past, but the reality is that if Britain leaves the common customs area, then presumably some sort of checks are going to be necessary on that border.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.Kevin Connolly says:Healthcare is one of those issues that remains relatively simple as long as the UK remains in the EU.It is just part of a range of citizens' rights that apply across the entire union. After Brexit, I suppose there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Norman Smith says:If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Kevin Connolly says:I should probably declare some sort of interest here as a dual Irish and British national myself.Of course, anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.Norman Smith says:I think the honest answer is you would have to be a legal eagle to answer this.But my take on it is that legally it looks like once we trigger Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.However, in the real world I think it is likely to be rather different, whatever the legal protocol.I think the truth is, if we were trundling along and decided it was all going to be catastrophic and we have got to pull up the handbrake pretty sharpish, a lot of other EU countries would be probably be laughing at us, but I think at the same time they would probably be quite pleased we weren't going.So I think the short answer is: legally, it doesn't look so good if you want to get out of it, but politically, it probably can be done with the support of other European leaders.Kevin Connolly says:This takes us to the heart of an issue that lots of people really care about. It will be a real and palpable sign of Brexit when there is a new UK passport without the words ""European Union"" on the front cover.Sadly, the short answer is we don't really know when the change will come about.But we can say that the cheapest thing for the government to do would be to phase in the new passports as people's old ones expire. So if you're looking forward to getting back that blue hard-back passport we had in the old days, you may have a long time to wait.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU conclude the citizens' rights negotiations.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-22,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180222184149/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

If he backs membership of a customs union, it could mean Mrs May faces a Commons showdown over the issue - with pro-European Conservative rebels joining forces with Labour MPs. Former prime minister Tony Blair said he would welcome a shift in policy from Labour towards a customs union - and if there was an ""impasse"" in Parliament on the issue, it made the case stronger for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.But Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey told the BBC: ""A referendum would be ridiculous, less than two years after we had one"".Conservative MP Anna Soubry says she has cross-party support for an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently going through Parliament, urging the government to pursue as a negotiating objective forming a customs union after Brexit.A customs union means countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union - but it does not allow members to strike their own trade deals.Supporters of the UK being in a customs union argue it is vital to protect businesses - but opponents fear it would mean ""Brexit in name only"" and the UK should make its own arrangements.Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a customs union was ""one way of getting frictionless trade but it is not the only way"".The government wanted to agree ""frictionless trade by agreement between two sovereign bodies, the United Kingdom and the European Union"", he said.Asked if there was any possibility of the government coming round to the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit, he replied: ""No"".The health secretary was not at the meeting of senior ministers at Chequers on Thursday but said a broad agreement had been reached ahead of a discussion by the whole cabinet and the prime minister's speech next week.""You have divergent views on a big issue like Brexit as you would expect - but the central common understanding is that there will be areas and sectors of industry where we agree to align our regulations with European regulations,"" he said. ""The automotive industry is perhaps an obvious example because of supply chains that are integrated.""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge, and what we won't be doing is accepting changes in rules because the EU unilaterally chooses to make those changes.""Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was at Chequers, told the BBC: ""We all got behind the prime minister and we've agreed the basis for her speech next week and looking forward to it going ahead."" But pro-EU Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna - an ally of Anna Soubry - warned Theresa May her plan to leave the customs union could be defeated by MPs.""There is no majority in the House of Commons for us not to participate in the customs union, that is absolutely clear... it's the reality of the parliamentary arithmetic."" Of the government, he said: ""If they are not going to change their position they are going to lose votes in the House of Commons, it's a straightforward as that.""Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that any ""comprehensive customs union"" would ""mitigate considerably the problems of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland"" and ""protect what we have achieved on the island of Ireland over these past couple of decades"".On Mr Hunt's comments on frictionless trade without a customs union, he said: ""I'm going to be really interested to see that deal because I literally don't understand what they mean. ""This is 'cake and eat it' - it's not just that Europe has made it clear that it won't agree that, it's that the nature of the single market is such is that it has one system of regulation.""Meanwhile the Times has reported that the prime minister is planning a U-turn over the right of EU citizens who arrive in the UK after Brexit, but during the ""transition period"", to remain in the country permanently. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC that would be ""quite wrong"": ""I'd be astonished if Mrs May would make U-turn of that kind; she is a lady of great backbone and for her to kowtow to the European Union is, I think, unconscionable."""
2018-02-23,MPs back bid to change organ donation laws,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43168524,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPlans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England, which it is claimed could save up to 500 lives a year, have been backed by MPs. A bill requiring people to ""opt out"" if they do not want their organs used passed its first parliamentary hurdle.Labour's Julie Elliott, whose daughter is receiving dialysis for a serious kidney disease, said it would give hope to thousands of transplant patients.The MP said her experience had made her realise how ""special"" donors were. Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's private members' bill, which would bring England into line with Wales which already has an opt-out system for consent, passed its second reading on Friday.The government has said it ""wholeheartedly"" supported the bill, which will now receive detailed scrutiny, which it said would be referred to the changes as Max's Law, after nine-year-old Max Johnson, who benefited from a heart transplant.There are 25 million people on the organ donation register but 6,500 patients are waiting for a transplant.At the moment in England, organs can only be used if explicit approval is given, either by signing the register or if the deceased had told a family member of their desire to donate. The UK government is consulting on introducing an opt-out system while Scotland is currently looking at bringing forward similar legislation. Mr Robinson told MPs that while levels of organ donation were considerably higher than a decade ago, the UK had some of the lowest rates of consent in Western Europe and a ""certain inertia"" had set in. According to NHS figures, he said about 500 people were dying every year due to a lack of suitable donors.""This is not good enough. I believe we can do better and be pioneers in making transplants more effective.""While changing the law would ""not make an immediate difference"", he said if the bill was passed by the end of the year it would increase the availability of organs over time and help give more people ""a new lease of life"". He also said he hoped it would make it easier for families to openly discuss the issue.""None of us likes to think about the worst happening,"" he said. ""It is challenging to have conversations with loved ones about their wishes after death.""We know that it is at that moment when families are confronted with the awful situation that very often they back off, sometimes over-riding the wishes of the deceased who happens to be a registered donor.""Ms Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, said her family's life had been transformed by her previously healthy 36-year old daughter Rebecca's diagnosis with a serious kidney complaint in late 2016.""What happened to us over the last 18 months could happen to anyone, rich or poor... and highlights the reality of the need to change the law to a position of deemed consent,"" she said.""From hopefully one day the family member of a recipient, I want to say (to donors) thank you very much from the bottom of my heart - you are very special people.""""Let us make the change in the law to save more lives of the thousands waiting for transplants.""Under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support.There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a brief appearance in the Commons to urge MPs to support the ""wonderful"" measure which he said would ""save an awful lot of people's lives"".In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. Former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said it would be wrong to describe the experience in Wales as a failure.But the Conservative MP said families should have a ""certain latitude"" to change their mind at what was obviously a very sensitive time following the death of a loved-one.

2018-02-23,Plastic straws could be banned in UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43169004,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove has suggested that plastic straws could be banned in Britain.When asked by the Daily Telegraph if he would prohibit plastic straws Mr Gove replied ""watch this space"".He added that a balanced approach would be needed but said: ""If it is bad, then banning it is a good thing.""The Marine Conservation Society estimates the UK uses 8.5 billion straws every year which are among the top 10 items found in beach clean-ups.Michael Gove also argued that outlawing plastic straws would be easier post-Brexit. He said that being in the EU meant there were ""some steps we might want to take environmentally that we can't yet.""But Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said the EU was already ahead of the UK on Twitter:According to the campaign group, Refuse The Straw, plastic straws take over 200 years to break down.  In January the Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to eliminate all avoidable plastic within 25 years.A number of restaurants including JD Wetherspoon, Wagamama and Pizza Express have announced that plastic straws would be phased out or only made available on request. The Queen has also sought to reduce plastic straw usage at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.However, a disability group has expressed concerns about the move to ban plastic straws.The Scottish campaigning group, One in Five, has said organisations were ""racing ahead"" to respond to ""understandable environmental concerns"" without having ""fully considered the needs of some disabled people"".The group argues that paper straws cannot be used for hot drinks and that metal straws could be dangerous for those with Parkinson's.The recent BBC documentary Blue Planet II, narrated by David Attenborough, highlighted the damage caused by plastic in the sea.This included a case of a pilot whale calf which is thought to have died after consuming its mother's milk contaminated with toxic chemicals from plastic.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningA government spokesman said: ""We are committed through our 25-year environment plan to eliminating avoidable plastic altogether by the end of 2042 so we leave our planet in a better state than we found it.""""We are exploring a range of options, and have already introduced a world-leading ban on microbeads, and set out plans to extend the 5p plastic bag charge, improve recycling rates and explore plastic-free aisles in supermarkets."""

2018-02-23,No agreement after Scottish Brexit talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43144393,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTalks between the UK and Scottish governments over Brexit have again broken up without agreement.The talks were centred on whether powers should go to Westminster or Holyrood from Brussels immediately after the UK leaves the EU. Both sides agree that progress has been made in recent weeks, but no deal has yet been agreed.UK government sources had said ahead of the meeting in London that they hoped a breakthrough was close.Further talks are expected to be held soon.The Scottish government has repeatedly insisted that the EU Withdrawal Bill is a ""power grab"" as it will see Westminster, rather than Holyrood, take control of 111 EU powers in devolved areas such as agriculture and fishing immediately after Brexit. The UK government confirmed on Thursday it had sent new proposals to Scottish government officials that would mean the ""vast majority of powers will automatically flow from the EU to the devolved administrations"".Speaking after the meeting, Scotland's Brexit minister Michael Russell told BBC Scotland it was ""likely"" that there would need to be direct talks between Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon over the issue at some point.But he said: ""I don't think we are at that stage quite yet because I think there has to be something to discuss, and there is no such agreement.""Mr Russell added: ""The absolutely fundamental point is that the devolution settlement and the powers of the Scottish Parliament cannot be changed unilaterally by the UK government. ""What happens to devolved powers must be a matter for Holyrood and the UK government must recognise that.""Progress is being made and we will continue to talk. I will continue to fight for the best deal for Scotland.""The major sticking point is that the UK government wants to retain ""supervision"" over some rules and regulations until UK-wide common frameworks are put in place. It believes this is needed to prevent the UK's internal market being disrupted by different parts of the country introducing separate rules and standards for things like fishing, farming, food labelling and environmental protection.The Scottish government says it is not opposed to UK-wide frameworks - but that, as they stand, the proposals would effectively give Westminster a veto over some of the Scottish Parliament's new powers.It says that it should be for the Scottish Parliament, rather than the UK government, to decide which of its areas of responsibility are dealt with at a UK level.Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said the proposals would ""effectively give the UK government powers of imposition, or powers of veto"" in matters that were devolved to Holyrood.And she said ""no Scottish government worth its salt"" would accept anything that did not fully protect the devolution settlement.What is the UK government proposing?Analysis by Brian Taylor, BBC Scotland political editor As I disclosed some weeks ago - when the issue was last discussed by ministers - the proposal in the EU Withdrawal Bill has been flipped.  The devolved powers will be returned to Scotland, Wales and NI. But with a caveat.  You will not be surprised to learn that it is the caveat which is causing contention. Indeed, the two sides tend to describe it in different terms, exemplifying their different standpoints.  Talk to sources in the Scottish government - and they describe the caveat as a ""veto"". Talk to sources in the UK government and they talk of a ""backstop"".So what is intended? The idea is that the powers would be returned to the devolved administrations - but the UK government would retain supervision over certain of those powers in the first instance.In essence, to avoid initial disparity, UK ministers would insist upon the adherence to EU rules - essentially replicating the EU framework, at first.  This would not apply to all the powers or anything like the totality. But it would be key powers such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and others. Read more from Brian  UK Brexit Secretary David Davis met senior figures from the devolved administrations - including Mr Russell - in London to discuss the proposals.The meeting was chaired by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who said: ""As we have always been clear, it is our intention that the devolved administrations will have more powers as a result of this process.""It is also very important that we protect the UK internal market and ensure that companies all across the UK are able to buy and sell freely.""His comments were echoed by Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who said the talks were ""making progress"" but that ""we are not there yet"". Mr Mundell added: ""These are complex negotiations but I think the UK government has demonstrated, by bringing forward the draft of an amendment, that we are demonstrating flexibility and we are addressing concerns that both the Scottish government and the Scottish Parliament have raised.""The two sides have until March to reach an agreement before the Brexit bill passes through the House of Lords and becomes law. Passing the bill without the backing of the Scottish Parliament could be politically problematic for the prime minister, who would be accused of ignoring Scottish opinion. The Scottish government is expected to introduce its own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood next week, but has indicated that the bill would only be needed if no agreement can be reached with the UK government."

Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from.Slides published online by the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market.But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"".Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated.On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work.The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission.It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"".No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years.But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra £4bn-£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020.He said that the current £35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020.For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations.Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union.""It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit."
2018-02-23,RBS reports first profit in 10 years,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43166560,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRoyal Bank of Scotland has returned to profit for the first time in a decade as it continues its recovery.Chief executive Ross McEwan told the BBC it was ""a really symbolic moment.""The bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, made an annual profit of £752m compared with a £6.95bn loss the year before.RBS still faces a potentially massive fine from the US Department of Justice over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages.RBS expanded rapidly in the boom years of the 2000s, and in October 2007 led a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for a massive £49bn, one of the largest deals in financial services history.However, the timing of this deal turned out to be unfortunate.A crisis swept through the financial sector, property prices plunged, economies fell into recession and banks lost billions.At the height of the crisis, in October 2008, the Treasury had to step in to bail RBS out for £45bn.Since the bank has been trying to get itself back into financial health. In 2013, Ross McEwan became chief executive, and he has turned the bank away from investment banking and towards UK High Street banking.By BBC economics editor, Kamal AhmedAfter nine years when accumulated losses totalled £58bn pounds - today a symbolic profit for RBS.Does it mean the government can start planning more confidently about selling the 71% stake it holds on behalf of the taxpayer?The fact the share price went down this morning by nearly 5% suggests not.Investors are still nervous about the multi-billion pound fine the bank is expecting from the US.At 269p, the RBS share price is still a long way below the 502p a share the government would need to break even on the billions of pounds it spent bailing out the bank a decade ago.It has already sold some of its stake at a loss - and will have to continue on that path for a long period yet, in the hope that eventually the share price will rise above that 502p and, overall, a profit can be made.Ross McEwan told me it would take three to five years before the government would have a ""much smaller"" level of ownership.Selling the taxpayers' stake in RBS has proved a much tougher and longer process than anyone imagined a decade ago.The sub-prime mortgage crisis came about after banks started giving high-risk loans to people with poor credit histories.Risky mortgages would be packaged up with other loans, bonds, or assets, and sold on to investors as so-called mortgage backed securities.RBS was one of the banks accused by the US Department of Justice of mis-selling these securities.The bank had expected to settle the case in 2017, but is now hoping it will reach an agreement this year.On Friday RBS set aside an extra £492m for US litigation, taking the total set aside for US court action around the sale of those products to £3.2bn.The issue complicates UK government plans to start selling down its stake in RBS.""We have been constantly hit with the sins of the past with conduct and litigation issues and I've been heavily restructuring the business to bring it back to the UK,"" Mr McEwan said.On Tuesday, after months of wrangling, MPs released a report by the financial regulator which said a unit of RBS mistreated thousands of small firms.The Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to the report took ""inappropriate"" action. Mr McEwan said the report ""did make for really tough reading"".""We did not get it right for customers at the time they needed us when their businesses were struggling,"" he said.""We just didn't look after them well enough"".The bank has now put in place a complaints process overseen by a former high court judge, Mr McEwan added.For the first time, RBS published the average pay gap between men and women in the bank, which it said was at 37.2%.""Our gender pay gap reflects an under-representation of women at senior levels,"" the bank said in its annual report.""That is not a satisfactory position and we know that we still have much to do to narrow the gap."""

""The past few months have been horrendous for me and my family,"" the statement said.

2018-02-23,DUP 'not aware of Sinn Féin legacy deal',https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-politics-43164472,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowArlene Foster has said the DUP was not aware of a deal between Sinn Féin and the government on Troubles' inquests in the absence of an overall agreement.The DUP leader said such a scenario would be ""astonishing"".Sinn Féin said the government agreed to a consultation on legacy measures, omitting any statute of limitations to curb security force prosecutions. The government replied that all its discussions were in the context of how it would respond to an overall deal.During the latest round of talks to restore power sharing, Sinn Féin held separate meetings with the government on legacy inquests, while the DUP held its own negotiations with the government about the Military Covenant.The Troubles legacy negotiations have been a long-running issue, and featured not only on the fringes of the most recent talks which collapsed on Valentine's Day, but also in the lead up to the 2014 Stormont House Agreement.The legacy inquests include some of the most controversial killings of the Troubles, and Northern Ireland's most senior judge previously asked for money to deal with the backlog  of outstanding cases. Details of the inquest funding proposals were discussed by Sinn Féin MLA Gerry Kelly on the BBC programme, The View, on Thursday night. He was reiterating a statement made last week by his party leader, Mary Lou McDonald, who said Sinn Féin had a separate ""commitment"" from the government to put inquest funding and legacy measures from the Stormont House Agreement out to public consultation. Mr Kelly claimed that during their separate meetings, the government had agreed that the consultation would not include a proposal for a controversial statute of limitations.However, the DUP's justice spokesman Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told The View he was not aware of any separate deal between the government and Sinn Féin. In a statement on Friday, Mrs Foster confirmed that during the most recent talks, she had been aware that Sinn Féin was meeting the government over inquest funding, as this was ""a matter of public record"".However, she said: ""No one in the DUP was aware of inquest funding being progressed in the absence of an overall agreement or a decision to advance all elements of the Stormont House Agreement. ""The DUP leader said she would be raising the matter with Secretary of State Karen Bradley.However, Sinn Féin MLA Declan Kearney insisted that Mrs Foster and the DUP negotiating team did know about his party's agreement with the government to release the funding for legacy inquests.He told BBC Radio Foyle the DUP leadership, who were involved in the negotiations, clearly understood that an agreement was being made.He said he denied it was a side deal: Sinn Féin met and agreed with NIO officials that the funding would be released, he said.Later, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill said she spoke to Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson on the progress made on legacy matters.""It is wrong and unhelpful for some to be dismissing this as some sort of side deal,"" Ms O'Neill said.""I updated the commissioner that the latest round of talks focused on three key issues including funding for legacy inquests, the initiation of the pre-legislative legacy consultation process and removal of the proposed 'alternative approaches to the past` section incorporating a `statute of limitations' or amnesty for state forces,"" she said in a statement.Alliance deputy Stephen Farry told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra that Sinn Féin had asked the other parties for a meeting to brief them on the talks.""In that meeting on Monday, they further reiterated that they believed they had a side deal with the UK government in relation to issues relating to the past,"" he said.""They did say they had, as part of the overall potential agreement at the end of previous week, the potential for that deal with the UK government, ""But in the absence of a (overall) deal not happening, they still wanted to see that deal going ahead. They had not got that confirmation from the UK government, but they were going to ask for that.""In 2016, Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan requested £10m to fund a five-year programme of inquests into more than 50 deaths.The list of cases included several killings which were carried out by members of the security forces. Gerry Kelly said he had proof of his party's agreement with the government to release inquest funding and wanted to see it implemented.""There are victims and survivors waiting - some of them over 45-46 years - give them some respite,"" Mr Kelly told BBC News NI's The View programme. Terminology explainedLast year, some Conservative and unionist MPs had called for a statute of limitations to prevent the prosecution of security force members for alleged offences from the early years of the Troubles.The idea was supported by Westminister's Defence Committee, which claimed legacy cases involving soldiers had been ""unfairly prioritised"" - a claim that was strongly disputed by Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service. The cross-party group of MPs urged the government to ""not lose sight of its moral responsibility to those who have served our country"".Military veterans have organised several marches and rallies, arguing it is unreasonable for historical charges to be brought against former soldiers who are now senior citizens.However, the suggestion was strongly opposed by Sinn Féin, the Irish government and some victims' groups. DUP leader Arlene Foster has also expressed reservations about a statute of limitations, fearing it will lead to a wider amnesty which might deprive Troubles victims of the chance of justice.Claims Sinn Féin and the government agreed a side deal on legacy are not new. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald revealed some of the detail a week ago, though not Mr Kelly's claim that proposals for a statute of limitations were now to be dropped from the planned consultation.“Separate from the agreement between the DUP and Sinn Féin we had a commitment from the British government to put to consultation the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House and release the funding requested by the Lord Chief Justice for coroner’s courts” .@MaryLouMcDonald pic.twitter.com/3d9o0px5lrEnd of Twitter post  by @sinnfeinirelandWhat is surprising is the claim from Sir Jeffrey - the DUP's Justice spokesperson - that he knew nothing about it.He was adamant no such proposal was put to him and that he would be annoyed if it was correct.Mr Kelly said: ""To say that the DUP, whatever about Jeffrey, didn't know about this is erroneous.""It raises new and intriguing questions about just what went on during this failed negotiation and who agreed what with whom and who knew.The murk just got murkier.Mr Kelly told The View: ""We had agreed the statute of limitations was not going to be in the consultation.  ""The consultation was going to be put out and the money was going to be released to the Lord Chief Justice - that was agreed.""In response, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""I am our party's representative on legacy issues and I am not aware of the government agreeing with Sinn Féin that they were going to hand over money for inquests.""Asked for a response to reports that Sinn Fein had a side deal with the government, the DUP said: ""Not surprising both sides will talk to the government about progressing issues of interest to themselves during negotiations.  ""We also were speaking to the government about certain matters and progress was made.""  The UUP said the DUP had ""played fast and loose with the future of unionism"". The party's leader, Robin Swann, said it was an ""outrageous"" situation.""Unionism now finds itself being a spectator as Her Majesty`s Government agrees a legacy deal behind our backs and apparently without the DUP's knowledge,"" he added.The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) said all discussions with parties were in the context of how the government would respond in the event of a deal.  ""Sadly there was no deal,"" said an NIO spokesperson. ""However, as the secretary of state made clear on Tuesday, she will still be consulting on how to implement Stormont House [Agreement] legacy institutions as soon as possible."" ""The government announced £150m to support legacy reform in 2014."""
2018-02-23,'Drug errors cause appalling harm',https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/health-43161929,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDrug errors in England cause appalling levels of harm and deaths, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says, as data suggests mistakes are being made.GPs, pharmacists, hospitals and care homes may be making 237 million errors a year - the equivalent of one mistake made for every five drugs handed out.The study said most caused no problems, but in more than a quarter of cases the mistakes could have caused harm.Drug errors could be a factor in thousands of deaths a year.The mistakes include:The researchers - drawn from Manchester, Sheffield and York universities - acknowledge that there is limited data in this area so the figures are very much best estimates based on previous research, some of it going back years. They estimate that drug errors cause 700 deaths a year and could also be a factor in between 1,700 and 22,300 other ones. A fifth of the mistakes related to hospital care, including errors made by doctors administering anaesthetic before surgery.The rest were pretty evenly split between drugs given in the community by GPs and pharmacists, and those handed out in care homes.In total 1.15 billion drug prescriptions are made each year.One of the people who suffered from a drug error was Catherine Young's mother, Irene.She was living in a care home and was aged 92 when she was given a host of wrong drugs for several weeks after her prescription was mixed up with another patient's.It meant she stopped getting steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica, which causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulder, neck and hips.This caused her to go into withdrawal, while she developed irritation around her eyes because she had started being given eye drops she did not need.Ms Young, from Suffolk, said the mistake had been missed by the GP, pharmacists and care home staff and spotted only when she had questioned the medication after noticing her mother's condition had been deteriorating.""It was down to me, a layman with no medical training, to sound the alarm. ""Thankfully we were able to act in time, but others have not been so lucky.""Royal College of Nursing chief executive Janet Davies said the study was ""deeply concerning"". She added: ""There is real problems in preserving patient safety when you haven't got enough staff and when we've got the financial pressures we have.""She said human error is ""one of the biggest risks"" and that overstretched nursing staff and agency workers put ""added risk in"" the system, but certainly did not make errors inevitable. Mr Hunt said he was concerned by the findings - although he pointed out that the research showed this was a global problem and not one unique to the NHS.""It is a far bigger problem than generally recognised, causing appalling levels of harm and death that are totally preventable.""In a speech to a patient safety conference in London on Friday, Mr Hunt is expected to outline steps the NHS is taking to reduce mistakes.These include the continued rollout of the much delayed electronic prescribing - only a third of hospitals have an effective system in place.The Department of Health and Social Care believe the roll out of electronic prescribing systems across more hospitals could reduce errors by 50%. In his speech, Mr Hunt will also say there needs to be greater openness about mistakes, so the NHS can learn from them.A change in the law is being introduced that will mean pharmacists will not be prosecuted for owning up to genuine mistakes.Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said doctors ""work hard to avoid making mistakes"" but were only human.The ""intense pressures"" on the front line would also be contributing to the problem, she added.Read more from NickFollow Nick on Twitter"
2018-02-23,Can illegal migrants trust NHS doctors?,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43139702,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPublic Health England is to look into concerns about doctors having to pass names and addresses of suspected illegal immigrants to the Home Office.It has launched a call for evidence on the policy at the request of the Department of Health and Social Care.Health bosses have been accused of ignoring evidence migrants are being deterred from seeking medical help for fear of deportation.But the health watchdog said it was a ""serious risk"" to public health.Doctors and patient groups warned it was damaging trust in the health service and breaching patient confidentiality, in evidence last month to the Health Select Committee.The committee was told one heavily pregnant woman had delayed seeing her GP for months - and some people were choosing to attend accident and emergency departments, where they are not required to give personal details.The policy is part of Theresa May's efforts, launched when she was Home Secretary, to make it more difficult for illegal migrants to set up home in the UK.The Home Office last year signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NHS Digital to make doctors hand over non-clinical details of patients, including their last known address, date of birth and NHS registration details to immigration officials.Some 8,000 people have reportedly had their details passed to immigration officials in this way.The government argues the data is non-clinical and at the lower end of confidentiality.But Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the health committee, wrote to NHS Digital last month to say the MoU had been signed without proper consultation and should be halted immediately for a review of confidentiality procedures.The Tory MP told NHS Digital chief executive Sarah Wilkinson: ""We now expect NHS Digital to take this opportunity to demonstrate that it takes its duties in respect of confidentiality seriously by listening to the concerns raised about the MoU and taking action accordingly. ""If it does not, we will expect to hold a further evidence session, where you will be required to provide a very much more convincing case for the continued operation of this MoU than has been presented so far.""NHS Digital is required by law to co-operate with the Home Office but it retains the right under the MoU to seek more information about requests for data and turn them down if ""not satisfied that request is in the public interest"". Dr Wollaston said in her letter: ""We do not believe that NHS Digital has fully considered and appropriately taken account of the public interest in maintaining a confidential medical service.""Launching the consultation, the Department of Health said there was evidence that ""fear of deportation is a barrier to seeking care"". But it added: ""There is currently however much less evidence about the impact of data-sharing arrangements and specific knowledge of those arrangements on deterring undocumented immigrants from seeking healthcare and treatment.""As a result, it has asked Public Health England to ""undertake a review within two years of the impact on public health and health-seeking behaviour arising from the disclosure of personal data in relation to the investigation of criminal offences, including immigration offences"". Submissions to the review should be sent by 30 March."
2018-02-23,"UK net migration falls to 244,000",https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43154308,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe number of EU citizens leaving the UK is at its highest level for a decade with 130,000 emigrating in the year to September, figures show.But 220,000 EU nationals still moved to Britain over the same period, the Office for National Statistics found.That is 47,000 fewer than the previous year.It means net EU migration - the difference between arrivals and departures - was 90,000, the lowest for five years.The figures also show that more British people are emigrating than are returning to live in the UK.Of those EU nationals arriving in the UK, fewer were coming for ""work-related reasons"", in particular to ""look for work"".Nicola White, head of international migration statistics at the ONS, said: ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons.""By contrast, immigration from countries outside the European Union is going up which means the UK population is continuing to grow at a similar level to early 2014.Some 285,000 non-EU citizens arrived in the UK in the 12-month period to September, and 80,000 departed.This gives a net increase of 205,000, the highest for six years.   BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this was largely driven by more people coming to study in the UK and an uncharacteristic dip in the previous year's figures that may have been corrected.He also speculated whether firms were starting to struggle to recruit or retain people from the EU, forcing them to look outside the EU.Overall, net migration is estimated to have fallen by 29,000 to 244,000 in the same period.This includes 73,000 British people coming back to the UK and 125,000 Britons leaving.The overall net migration figure is still well short of the government's target to reduce net migration to below 100,000, a pledge made in the 2010, 2015 and 2017 Tory manifestos.By home affairs correspondent Danny ShawWhat explanation could there be for the decline in EU migration other than Brexit?  In the two years before the June 2016 referendum, the number of EU nationals arriving in Britain was stable at about 240,000 to 280,000.  But every quarter since then has recorded falls, from 284,000 to 220,000.  At the same time, the number of EU leavers, which hadn't risen higher than 100,000 since 2010, began to rise, from 95,000 to 130,000. Whether it's a feeling that EU citizens aren't wanted in the UK, uncertainty about their future or the growing relative strength of other EU economies, there has been a notable shift away from Britain's shores. Nevertheless, overall net migration remains at historically high levels, well above the government's controversial target, with a rise in migration from outside Europe.Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said the latest figures demonstrated that the UK was still attracting the ""brightest and best people"" to come to work and study and described the increase in the number of overseas students as a ""huge positive"". ""We are a country that is open for business,"" she added. ""We want to have great relations with our European neighbours going forward but at the same time we need to have a sustainable migration system,"" she said.Asked whether falling numbers would adversely affect some sectors, in particular the NHS, Ms Nokes said the independent migration advisory committee was due to report its findings on EU patterns to the government in September so decisions could be made based on evidence.You might also be interested in:Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said net migration was still double the government's target and accused the Home Office of turning away qualified doctors despite a recruitment shortage in the NHS.""This deficit hurts us all and highlights the immigration mess the government has created,"" she said.The ONS figures also show that in 2017, the UK granted asylum, alternative forms of protection or resettlement to almost 15,000 people, 40% of whom were under 18.Separate figures from the Home Office showed more than 10,500 people have been granted refuge in the UK after fleeing the conflict in Syria, under the Vulnerable Person Resettlement scheme.Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who is in Lebanon near the Syrian border, said the government was considering extending its commitment to rehome 20,000 people by 2020.Other figures from the Home Office show there were 141,302 applications made for British citizenship in 2017, an increase of 8% on the previous year.This was 39% lower than the peak of 232,262 in 2013. There is evidence that more EU citizens, who have settled in the UK, are applying for citizenship, with applications more than doubling from 15,460 in 2016 to 38,528 in 2017.   "

A great reforming home secretary, a much-admired chancellor, a great European and somebody whose values and life that in many ways I have followed"".Roy Harris Jenkins was born in 1920 and was the product of the mining valleys of south Wales. A grammar school boy, who went on to win a first at Oxford.He was immersed in politics from an early age, following in his father's footsteps and becoming a Labour MP in 1948. As home secretary in the Labour government of the mid-1960s, Roy Jenkins oversaw some of the great social reforms of the 20th Century, including abortion rights, divorce, and the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. As a student, the young Vince Cable felt a great admiration for what Jenkins had achieved,""This was the era of Mary Whitehouse, an attempt to restore old fashioned values ... there was this enormous sort of mood, particularly amongst young people to sweep away all the rather old fashioned values which seemed to exist at that time ... and he, more than anybody else, lifted the barriers. ""It changed the face of the country, it modernised it, in a way that we would regard as perfectly normal today"".His experiences during World War II, first in the Royal Artillery and then as a code breaker at Bletchley Park, made him a passionate European. He would defy many in his party and campaign for membership in the 1975 referendum, leaving UK politics to become president of the European Commission two years later. What would Lord Jenkins make of Brexit Britain?""People of his generation were people who had fought in the war, who saw the rebuilding of Europe as something that was a political objective to end conflict in Europe ... I think he would be a very, very sad heartbroken man, if he saw what had happened today"".Lord Jenkins is often described as a ""bon viveur"" and it is in his celebrated love of the ""good life"" that Sir Vince sees the greatest difference in their characters,""My lifestyle is a little bit different, I'm probably a bit more puritanical, a bit more frugal. He liked the big long lunch, which became, I think, rather celebrated. A great lover of high class wines - I never really got into that.""But he did greatly respect Lord Jenkins's approach to politics and his relationships across the political divide, including leading Conservative politicians and well-known ""lefties"" like Tony Benn.""I did respect that in him, he had a good relationships right across the spectrum. Those were days when MPs used to write each other private letters of congratulation and condolence, and there was a kind of civilised environment.""Returning from Europe some years later, Roy Jenkins felt a growing alienation from the Labour Party as it swung to the left under the leadership of Michael Foot.In 1981, he and the other prominent ""moderates"" known as the Gang of Four would leave to set up the Social Democratic Party. A certain Vince Cable was among the Labour converts, ""What was most difficult, I think, for him and also for many of us was the break with many of the other so-called ""moderates"" in the Labour Party. ""One of his closest associates, Anthony Crosland, who had actually been his lover when they were at university together, and Roy Hattersley and people of that kind ... it was bitter for many years.""The SDP would later merge with the Liberals, to form the Liberal Democrats, and while many in the Labour movement believed Lord Jenkins had betrayed his party and his roots, Sir Vince thinks, on balance, it was a decision based on principle, for the national good.""Historians will argue for many, many years as to whether the breakaway was justified. I think, actually, the Labour Party modernisation which started under Neil Kinnock through John Smith to Tony Blair probably wouldn't have happened, if it hadn't been for the SDP breakaway.""And I think British politics is much the better for having had the Lib Dems, of which he was one of the parents.""In his later years as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Roy Jenkins would advise Tony Blair as the New Labour project took form.As chancellor of Oxford University for more than 16 years, he would continue to write the acclaimed political biographies which he'd produced throughout his life. Married to wife Jennifer for nearly six decades, he died in 2003, at the age of 82. ""I think he was one of the great statesmen of the post war era,"" Sir Vince said.""You can read his legacy in his books. I think he fell short of what he ultimately wanted to achieve, he never became prime minister, his vision of the SDP Liberal Alliance never led to government as he had hoped, but he was a genuinely great figure in post-war British politics."""
2018-02-23,Labouring over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43163354,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt had been billed as an away day to thrash out Labour's policy on Brexit - a kind of shadow of the Chequers gathering. In the end when Labour's Brexit sub-committee met this week, it wasn't ""away"" from Westminster and it wasn't a day. A paper was tabled but not formally endorsed.But I'm told that nuances have been ironed out and it has all but got the approval of the party leadership. It will form the basis of Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit speech on Monday.What is he likely to say? Labour insiders favour the word ""evolution"" to describe any change. Contrary to speculation, there won't be a seismic shift in policy but it will move forward.In the summer, under pressure from some of his MPs, unions and his shadow Brexit secretary Mr Corbyn signed up to a policy of staying both in the single market  and the customs union for any ""transitional"" period after Brexit.The Labour position has been to argue that ""a"" customs union was ""a viable option"" and that the government should ""keep all options open"".What we are likely to see on Monday is wording that makes plain that ""a"" not ""the"" customs union would have distinct benefits and is the most logical way to solve the thorny issue of the Irish border. It won't just be a viable option but a viable end point. And the policy is likely to evolve in another way too.Currently Labour recognises that when we are out of the EU, we are out of the single market. So it is arguing that it wants to retain the same benefits as single market membership - such as tariff-free trade.I'm told the same formulation could be applied to ""a"" customs union, that in the long term a future Labour government could sign up to one, if the UK got the exact same benefits as it gets from ""the"" customs union - frictionless trade and a say over the external tariff on imported goods.As Labour has talked about the benefits of some form of customs union before, this would be an incremental not dramatic move forward.However party insiders say that Jeremy Corbyn can't guarantee that a future Labour government would definitely be in such a customs union because it would have to be negotiated with the EU. But one insider said that people listening on Monday will have no doubt where Labour is headed: That a customs union is the preferred option. Speaking on LBC radio, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry gave credence to this by saying: ""We have to negotiate a new agreement. That, we think, is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" While this would give the UK the current customs union's benefits, it would also have to take the burdens - including severe limitations on negotiating new non-EU trade deals.However one Labour strategist warned that when it comes to Brexit policy, there are ""many trees in the forest"". The customs union may rise like a redwood in the forthcoming Corbyn speech, but it's worth looking at what else is growing and developing at the same time.If Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer is to be happy with the evolving policy - and I'm told he is - there will have to be words about how close the UK should stick to the EU economically and socially in order to get some of the benefits of the single market. So expect Mr Corbyn to re-emphasise that he would not undercut EU standards.Diane Abbott this week gave more detail on what Labour meant by a ""jobs first"" Brexit saying: ""Immigration is subordinate to our priorities which favour growth, jobs and prosperity.""In the past, Labour spokespeople have said they will accept the end of free movement when the transitional period finishes, but phrases such as ""easy movement"" have been bandied about - possibly an agreement that citizens could move between the UK and EU with minimum red tape to take up job offers, but not simply to look for work.Although a majority of Labour voters opposed Brexit, a significant minority backed it and so far the party's ambiguity doesn't seem to have dented its position in the polls.  So why give more clarity? For some, it is driven primarily by politics not economics.There was speculation that Labour might unequivocally commit to the customs union in order to inflict a government defeat - with Tory rebels' help - in the forthcoming trade and customs bill. While about 50 Labour MPs would vote to stay in ""the"" customs union, most so far haven't upset their leadership and have abstained when the issue has come up.  While a handful of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs would back the government, if the party leadership signalled to MPs to vote against it because Labour was now more sympathetic to a customs union as an end point, then Theresa May would be in danger of losing. For some Labour figures, the real aim of the ""evolution"" in Labour's policy is to prepare the ground for a much bigger issue. It is to create enough space between the government and opposition to allow Labour to credibly to vote down any deal that Theresa May brings back from Brussels and destabilise her in the process.So if she clings on, Labour will make her ""own"" any Brexit fallout. If she is toppled, they would call for an election. But to get there, Labour has to be clearer on the policy divide - and now we are seeing that open up, slowly, before our eyes."

Decisions made in London and Brussels will have profound consequences for the 250,000 people who live in the UK's 14 overseas territories - yet another thread of complexity in the Brexit process.Gibraltar has always had the potential to cause a Brexit bust-up, even though Article 50 is perhaps less important here than Article 10... of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.That was when Spain ceded sovereignty of the Rock to Britain - a decision it appears to have regretted ever since.Gibraltar voted 96% in favour of remaining in the EU. There was enormous shock in the territory when the UK voted to leave, taking Gibraltar with it.""The atmosphere of disaster and grief was absolutely palpable,"" recalls Marlene Hassan Nahon, an independent member of the Gibraltar parliament.""One of my good friends met me for breakfast. She was dressed in a black dress, crying her eyes out.""Britain's Overseas TerritoriesLocal businesses are beginning to get more used to the idea of operating outside the single market, especially after the government of Gibraltar revealed that roughly 90% of its financial services trade within the single market is actually with the UK.""Somehow we had not realised or considered it before,"" says Joe Garcia, a veteran local journalist who has been covering all things Gibraltar since the 1960s.""People who bet online in Britain, 60% of those bets actually come through Gibraltar, and it's the same with requests for car insurance. When you are out in Britain, look around. One out of every six cars is insured in Gibraltar.""But many of the people who work in the sector live across the border in Spain. And there are persistent fears about the potential for long delays at the border after Brexit, and about the future of the Rock's low tax regime, which Spain sees as unfair competition. ""They will probably try to use [Brexit] to get Gibraltar to stop being what they call a tax haven,"" says Spanish historian Mercedes Penalba-Sotorrio. ""I think one of the main priorities is to stop that.""But the most sensitive issue is Spain's long-standing claim for sovereignty - shared or otherwise - which is rejected outright by both the UK and Gibraltar itself.Suspicion was heightened after the remaining EU27 decided formally that no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without a bilateral agreement between Spain and the UK.Now that language is threatening to complicate negotiations on a transition period for the UK after Brexit.""To the frustration of Brussels and the rest of the EU,"" says Mujtaba Rahman of the political consultancy Eurasia Group, ""Madrid is now arguing that the transition represents one such agreement - and that the transition should not apply to Gibraltar unless Spain explicitly agrees, which it currently does not.""If Gibraltar feels under threat, at least it has some influential supporters in London. Last year The Sun updated its classic early 90s headline ""Up Yours Delors"" for the front-page benefit of Spain: ""Up Yours Senors"".But spare a thought for Britain's overseas territories with rather less clout. The Caribbean island of Anguilla has a sea border with the EU, and is fearful of the future. Devastated by Hurricane Irma last year, and dependent on neighbouring islands, it is now bracing for Brexit.Anguilla's closest gateway to the world lies four miles across the sea in the French half of the island of St Martin, which is officially part of France, and therefore an ""outermost region"" of the EU. Anguilla relies on access to St Martin for many of its daily necessities - from food supplies to MRI scans to the postal service. The nearest international airport lies on the Dutch side of St Martin. ""We have a symbiotic relationship, and we really don't want Brexit to change it,"" says Blondel Cluff, the Anguillan government representative in London. ""But I don't think we've come up in the negotiations yet."" In a report published last year entitled ""Anguilla & Brexit: Britain's forgotten EU border"", the Anguillan government called for a regional customs union with St Martin and a common travel area. Anguilla is also mostly ineligible for British development aid, and is therefore highly dependent on money coming from the EU for more than a third of its budget.""I know it's difficult when we have a population the size of a British village,"" says Blondel Cluff, ""but we need to make sure we don't get forgotten in the mix."" It all means that even half way round the world Brexit is raising concerns about the freedom of movement of goods, of services, and of course of people. ""The fact that people in overseas territories are going to lose an important element of their citizenship, without having been asked about it, may well give rise to legal challenges in the future,"" says Susie Alegre, a lawyer specialising in the rights of citizens in the British Overseas Territories.Given the bewildering range of Brexit issues that need to be resolved, it is hardly surprising that the overseas territories have not received the attention they feel they deserve. But Susie Alegre believes that could change. ""It may well be - and particularly with the case of Gibraltar - that in the next year you'll suddenly see quite serious issues popping up out of these dots on the map."""
2018-02-23,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-23,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43113714,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Cutting tuition fees for university students without changing anything else would make the system less progressive.Reality Check verdict: If no other parts of the system were changed, a simple cut in tuition fees would not help those lower-income graduates who would not repay their loans within 30 years and would help higher-income graduates who would repay them.  Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-23,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-23,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180223160713/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

Mr Tusk, who is due to meet the PM the day before, said media reports suggested that the ""cake philosophy is still alive"" in the UK.He added: ""If the media reports are correct I am afraid that the UK position today is based on pure illusion.""He went on to reject - as he has done before - any notion of the UK ""cherry picking"" aspects of its future relationship with the EU or being able to join a ""single market a la carte"". The BBC understands that the 11 senior ministers at Chequers made a breakthrough on so-called ""managed divergence"", where the UK could select EU rules to stick to post-Brexit.Negativity from EU’s Tusk is stark compared relief and relative optimism in UK gov that have found common #brexit position ‘for now’ 2End of Twitter post  by @BBCkatyaadlerBut need to put this into context a) Tusk has tendency to make stand-out put-down statements on U.K. #brexit positions - eg when warned instead of having cake and eating it, UK would find salt and vinegar on its Brexit plate 3End of Twitter post 2 by @BBCkatyaadlerb) UK gov position is not outlined in full yet.

But we cannot stand by and wait.""He said he hoped to have more clarity when he meets the PM in London next week.The leaders also spoke about the EU's post-2020 budget, the composition of the European Parliament, Turkey and Syria.The government is set to pursue a policy which puts the UK outside a customs union with the EU - but matching EU rules in some industries in an attempt to achieve ""frictionless trade"".Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who did not attend the meeting of senior ministers, said despite ""divergent views"" there was a ""central common understanding"".He said some sectors could align regulations with European regulations, adding: ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge."""

""We are really on our way now,"" he told BBC News.""I am coming up on 97  - we are going to get this in before 100.""Extending votes to all expats with no time limit is a Conservative Party manifesto promise from the 2017 election.But it is being introduced into law as a private member's bill, sponsored by Conservative MP Glyn Davies.Mr Shindler, who is a member of the Labour Party, said he was ""very proud"" of the British political system, after losing a number of court battles over the years.""They have done a good job, without making party politics come into it,"" he said.The Second Word War veteran has lived in Italy for 35 years but gave up the chance of Italian citizenship to fight his campaign for expat votes.Labour MP Sandy Martin attempted to block the legislation by speaking for 45 minutes, saying ""15 years is actually a very reasonable amount of time"" for people to be able to vote once they've left the UK.He also suggested the bill had been downgraded to a private member's bill because the Conservatives found it ""embarrassing"" to extend the vote to people who have ""chosen not to pay their taxes in this country"".But Conservative backbencher Sir Roger Gale said Mr Martin should meet Mr Shindler, to explain to him why he, as a proud Briton, shouldn't be allowed to vote.""I want Harry Shindler and those millions of expats like him, who are proudly British, who take a keen interest, who regard it as their mother country...I want them to have that right"", said Sir Roger.Lib Dem MP Layla Moran also spoke in support of the bill, saying British people abroad are ""every bit as British as the people in this room"" and they have ""lost their voice"" because of ""outdated"" notions of what it is to be British.The bill passed to committee stage unopposed."

Ecuador is willing, but not necessarily the other party"".She said her country would ""continue looking for mechanisms"" to end the stalemate.But a spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: ""Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice""Last December, Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship in a move which the country hoped could give him immunity in the UK.But the UK does not recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent and continues to insist he should ""face justice"".There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador so he cannot be arrested inside the embassy.Mr Assange breached bail conditions when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy six years ago. He faced questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped.Previously, Mr Assange has justified his decision to break bail conditions arguing if he faced the Swedish authorities he would be extradited to the US over the publication of classified documents."
2018-02-24,EU leaders debate post-Brexit budget deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43169054,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU leaders have agreed to spend more on common defence and security policy in their next long-term budget, European Council President Donald Tusk says.Leaders of 27 states were meeting in Brussels to shape the 2021-27 budget.Members have been in disagreement on how to compensate for funding loss after Britain's planned 2019 departure. Germany and France have warned any funding cuts to EU programmes could damage efforts to tackle illegal immigration and terrorism.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Tusk said leaders had agreed to spend more on security, as well as fighting illegal migration in their next long-term budget.He said many of the EU leaders were ready to contribute more to the pot, but acknowledged others were less forthcoming.Deciding how to fill the budgetary hole that Brexit will leave is problematic, says the BBC's Kevin Connolly, as net contributors such as Austria and the Netherlands take a sharply different view from net beneficiaries such as Poland and Greece. While wealthier Northern countries make the case for a reduced budget, poorer member states in eastern and southern Europe are unhappy about the possibility of cuts to programme funding.Ahead of Friday's talks, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had said he was concerned about a ""rift between east and west"". ""Sometimes it gets wider and sometimes differences are bridged. I don't want any new divisions in Europe. We've had enough of those.""By Kevin Connolly, BBC News, BrusselsEU budget problems are not fixed in a single afternoon of talks - agreeing how much the organisation should collect from member states after Brexit will take months.There's a clear division between the rich countries, who don't want to fix the post-Brexit shortfall by paying more, and the poor countries, who don't want to bridge it by taking less.And all the while, like the rumble of gunfire from a neighbouring battlefield, the Brexit issue hangs in the air here. Plenty of European leaders have said that progress can't be made until they have more clarity and certainty from the British side. Separately, it was also announced that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May is to deliver long-awaited speech setting out her vision for the UK's future relationship with the EU on 2 March. Speaking on Friday, Mr Tusk said EU leaders planned to push ahead with the release of their own joint stance for future relations in March, whether Britain is ready or not. He said the bloc would be ""extremely realistic in our assessment of possible new proposals"", while labelling the UK's approach to the negotiations as ""pure illusion""."
2018-02-24,MPs back bid to change organ donation laws,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43168524,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPlans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England, which it is claimed could save up to 500 lives a year, have been backed by MPs. A bill requiring people to ""opt out"" if they do not want their organs used passed its first parliamentary hurdle.Labour's Julie Elliott, whose daughter is receiving dialysis for a serious kidney disease, said it would give hope to thousands of transplant patients.The MP said her experience had made her realise how ""special"" donors were. Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's private members' bill, which would bring England into line with Wales which already has an opt-out system for consent, passed its second reading on Friday.The government has said it ""wholeheartedly"" supported the bill, which it said would be referred to the changes as Max's Law, after nine-year-old Max Johnson, who benefited from a heart transplant.People like @vancole9 are living proof of why action & change on organ donation is needed – today I backed @geoffrey4covNW’s bill as a first step towards the life-saving reforms we need. https://t.co/F171IkXyaJ https://t.co/tcH0GY0n72End of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_HuntThere are 25 million people on the organ donation register but 6,500 patients are waiting for a transplant.At the moment in England, organs can only be used if explicit approval is given, either by signing the register or if the deceased had told a family member of their desire to donate. The UK government is consulting on introducing an opt-out system while Scotland is currently looking at bringing forward similar legislation. Mr Robinson told MPs that while levels of organ donation were considerably higher than a decade ago, the UK had some of the lowest rates of consent in Western Europe and a ""certain inertia"" had set in. According to NHS figures, he said about 500 people were dying every year due to a lack of suitable donors.""This is not good enough. I believe we can do better and be pioneers in making transplants more effective.""While changing the law would ""not make an immediate difference"", he said if the bill was passed by the end of the year it would increase the availability of organs over time and help give more people ""a new lease of life"". He also said he hoped it would make it easier for families to openly discuss the issue.""None of us likes to think about the worst happening,"" he said. ""It is challenging to have conversations with loved ones about their wishes after death.""We know that it is at that moment when families are confronted with the awful situation that very often they back off, sometimes over-riding the wishes of the deceased who happens to be a registered donor.""Ms Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, said her family's life had been transformed by her previously healthy 36-year old daughter Rebecca's diagnosis with a serious kidney complaint in late 2016.""What happened to us over the last 18 months could happen to anyone, rich or poor... and highlights the reality of the need to change the law to a position of deemed consent,"" she said.""From hopefully one day the family member of a recipient, I want to say (to donors) thank you very much from the bottom of my heart - you are very special people.""""Let us make the change in the law to save more lives of the thousands waiting for transplants.""Under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support.There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a brief appearance in the Commons to urge MPs to support the ""wonderful"" measure which he said would ""save an awful lot of people's lives"".In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. Former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said it would be wrong to describe the experience in Wales as a failure.But the Conservative MP said families should have a ""certain latitude"" to change their mind at what was obviously a very sensitive time following the death of a loved-one.

2018-02-24,Plastic straws could be banned in UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43169004,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEnvironment Secretary Michael Gove has suggested that plastic straws could be banned in Britain.When asked by the Daily Telegraph if he would prohibit plastic straws Mr Gove replied ""watch this space"".He added that a balanced approach would be needed but said: ""If it is bad, then banning it is a good thing.""The Marine Conservation Society estimates the UK uses 8.5 billion straws every year which are among the top 10 items found in beach clean-ups.Michael Gove also argued that outlawing plastic straws would be easier post-Brexit. He said that being in the EU meant there were ""some steps we might want to take environmentally that we can't yet.""But Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said the EU was already ahead of the UK on Twitter:.@michaelgove One step ahead of you. EU legislation on single-use plastics coming before the summer. Maybe you can align with us? #EUDoesntSuck #StrongerTogether #PlasticsStrategy https://t.co/hbBBXT1eGaEnd of Twitter post  by @TimmermansEUMr Gove responded by claiming there had been ""no specific proposal - as yet - from the EU to ban straws"". According to the campaign group, Refuse The Straw, plastic straws take over 200 years to break down.  In January the Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to eliminate all avoidable plastic within 25 years.A number of restaurants including JD Wetherspoon, Wagamama and Pizza Express have announced that plastic straws would be phased out or only made available on request. The Queen has also sought to reduce plastic straw usage at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.However, a disability group has expressed concerns about the move to ban plastic straws.The Scottish campaigning group, One in Five, has said organisations were ""racing ahead"" to respond to ""understandable environmental concerns"" without having ""fully considered the needs of some disabled people"".The group argues that paper straws cannot be used for hot drinks and that metal straws could be dangerous for those with Parkinson's.The recent BBC documentary Blue Planet II, narrated by David Attenborough, highlighted the damage caused by plastic in the sea.This included a case of a pilot whale calf which is thought to have died after consuming its mother's milk contaminated with toxic chemicals from plastic.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningA government spokesman said: ""We are committed through our 25-year environment plan to eliminating avoidable plastic altogether by the end of 2042 so we leave our planet in a better state than we found it.""""We are exploring a range of options, and have already introduced a world-leading ban on microbeads, and set out plans to extend the 5p plastic bag charge, improve recycling rates and explore plastic-free aisles in supermarkets."""

2018-02-24,Hunt rules out staying in customs union,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43167824,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJeremy Hunt has said there is no possibility of the government backing a customs union with the EU after Brexit.The health secretary said the UK wanted ""frictionless trade"" but would ""find a different way"" to achieve that.A Conservative MP says she has cross-party support for an amendment calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit.Theresa May will make a speech on the UK's future relationship with the EU next Friday.And Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to outline Labour policy on a customs union on Monday, amid reports that his party's position on it is ""evolving"". If he backs membership of a customs union, it could mean Mrs May faces a Commons showdown over the issue - with pro-European Conservative rebels joining forces with Labour MPs. Former prime minister Tony Blair said he would welcome a shift in policy from Labour towards a customs union - and if there was an ""impasse"" in Parliament on the issue, it made the case stronger for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.But Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey told the BBC: ""A referendum would be ridiculous, less than two years after we had one"".Conservative MP Anna Soubry says she has cross-party support for an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently going through Parliament, urging the government to pursue as a negotiating objective forming a customs union after Brexit.A customs union means countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union - but it does not allow members to strike their own trade deals.Supporters of the UK being in a customs union argue it is vital to protect businesses - but opponents fear it would mean ""Brexit in name only"" and the UK should make its own arrangements.Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a customs union was ""one way of getting frictionless trade but it is not the only way"".The government wanted to agree ""frictionless trade by agreement between two sovereign bodies, the United Kingdom and the European Union"", he said.Asked if there was any possibility of the government coming round to the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit, he replied: ""No"".The health secretary was not at the meeting of senior ministers at Chequers on Thursday but said a broad agreement had been reached ahead of a discussion by the whole cabinet and the prime minister's speech next week.""You have divergent views on a big issue like Brexit as you would expect - but the central common understanding is that there will be areas and sectors of industry where we agree to align our regulations with European regulations,"" he said. ""The automotive industry is perhaps an obvious example because of supply chains that are integrated.""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge, and what we won't be doing is accepting changes in rules because the EU unilaterally chooses to make those changes.""Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was at Chequers, told the BBC: ""We all got behind the prime minister and we've agreed the basis for her speech next week and looking forward to it going ahead."" But pro-EU Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna - an ally of Anna Soubry - warned Theresa May her plan to leave the customs union could be defeated by MPs.""There is no majority in the House of Commons for us not to participate in the customs union, that is absolutely clear... it's the reality of the parliamentary arithmetic."" Of the government, he said: ""If they are not going to change their position they are going to lose votes in the House of Commons, it's a straightforward as that.""Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that any ""comprehensive customs union"" would ""mitigate considerably the problems of a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland"" and ""protect what we have achieved on the island of Ireland over these past couple of decades"".On Mr Hunt's comments on frictionless trade without a customs union, he said: ""I'm going to be really interested to see that deal because I literally don't understand what they mean. ""This is 'cake and eat it' - it's not just that Europe has made it clear that it won't agree that, it's that the nature of the single market is such is that it has one system of regulation.""Meanwhile the Times has reported that the prime minister is planning a U-turn over the right of EU citizens who arrive in the UK after Brexit, but during the ""transition period"", to remain in the country permanently. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC that would be ""quite wrong"": ""I'd be astonished if Mrs May would make U-turn of that kind; she is a lady of great backbone and for her to kowtow to the European Union is, I think, unconscionable."""
2018-02-24,No agreement after Scottish Brexit talks,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43144393,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTalks between the UK and Scottish governments over Brexit have again broken up without agreement.The talks were centred on whether powers should go to Westminster or Holyrood from Brussels immediately after the UK leaves the EU. Both sides agree that progress has been made in recent weeks, but no deal has yet been agreed.UK government sources had said ahead of the meeting in London that they hoped a breakthrough was close.Further talks are expected to be held soon.The Scottish government has repeatedly insisted that the EU Withdrawal Bill is a ""power grab"" as it will see Westminster, rather than Holyrood, take control of 111 EU powers in devolved areas such as agriculture and fishing immediately after Brexit. The UK government confirmed on Thursday it had sent new proposals to Scottish government officials that would mean the ""vast majority of powers will automatically flow from the EU to the devolved administrations"".Speaking after the meeting, Scotland's Brexit minister Michael Russell told BBC Scotland it was ""likely"" that there would need to be direct talks between Theresa May and Nicola Sturgeon over the issue at some point.But he said: ""I don't think we are at that stage quite yet because I think there has to be something to discuss, and there is no such agreement.""Mr Russell added: ""The absolutely fundamental point is that the devolution settlement and the powers of the Scottish Parliament cannot be changed unilaterally by the UK government. ""What happens to devolved powers must be a matter for Holyrood and the UK government must recognise that.""Progress is being made and we will continue to talk. I will continue to fight for the best deal for Scotland.""The major sticking point is that the UK government wants to retain ""supervision"" over some rules and regulations until UK-wide common frameworks are put in place. It believes this is needed to prevent the UK's internal market being disrupted by different parts of the country introducing separate rules and standards for things like fishing, farming, food labelling and environmental protection.The Scottish government says it is not opposed to UK-wide frameworks - but that, as they stand, the proposals would effectively give Westminster a veto over some of the Scottish Parliament's new powers.It says that it should be for the Scottish Parliament, rather than the UK government, to decide which of its areas of responsibility are dealt with at a UK level.Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said the proposals would ""effectively give the UK government powers of imposition, or powers of veto"" in matters that were devolved to Holyrood.And she said ""no Scottish government worth its salt"" would accept anything that did not fully protect the devolution settlement.What is the UK government proposing?Analysis by Brian Taylor, BBC Scotland political editor As I disclosed some weeks ago - when the issue was last discussed by ministers - the proposal in the EU Withdrawal Bill has been flipped.  The devolved powers will be returned to Scotland, Wales and NI. But with a caveat.  You will not be surprised to learn that it is the caveat which is causing contention. Indeed, the two sides tend to describe it in different terms, exemplifying their different standpoints.  Talk to sources in the Scottish government - and they describe the caveat as a ""veto"". Talk to sources in the UK government and they talk of a ""backstop"".So what is intended? The idea is that the powers would be returned to the devolved administrations - but the UK government would retain supervision over certain of those powers in the first instance.In essence, to avoid initial disparity, UK ministers would insist upon the adherence to EU rules - essentially replicating the EU framework, at first.  This would not apply to all the powers or anything like the totality. But it would be key powers such as agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and others. Read more from Brian  UK Brexit Secretary David Davis met senior figures from the devolved administrations - including Mr Russell - in London to discuss the proposals.The meeting was chaired by Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, who said: ""As we have always been clear, it is our intention that the devolved administrations will have more powers as a result of this process.""It is also very important that we protect the UK internal market and ensure that companies all across the UK are able to buy and sell freely.""His comments were echoed by Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who said the talks were ""making progress"" but that ""we are not there yet"". Mr Mundell added: ""These are complex negotiations but I think the UK government has demonstrated, by bringing forward the draft of an amendment, that we are demonstrating flexibility and we are addressing concerns that both the Scottish government and the Scottish Parliament have raised.""The two sides have until March to reach an agreement before the Brexit bill passes through the House of Lords and becomes law. Passing the bill without the backing of the Scottish Parliament could be politically problematic for the prime minister, who would be accused of ignoring Scottish opinion. The Scottish government is expected to introduce its own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood next week, but has indicated that the bill would only be needed if no agreement can be reached with the UK government."

Documents suggest European Commission negotiators will not approve of a UK proposal that seeks to select which EU rules to stick to post-Brexit and which to diverge from.Slides published online by the commission say such an approach would be ""not compatible with the principles"" set out in the EU's own guidelines and posed a risk to the ""proper functioning"" of its single market.But an EU diplomat told the BBC ""we are hoping for a relationship that is as close as possible to the existing relationship"", adding that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier should be given a mandate ""to explore all possibilities"".Before the final arrangements with the EU kick in, a temporary transition period is planned - although the details have yet to be negotiated.On Wednesday, the UK set out its plans for how this ""status quo"" transition phase should work.The document suggests the UK will abide by new EU laws and be involved in talks on future fishing quotas, but will not be able to sign trade deals without the EU's permission.It also says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"".No 10 denied this meant it would be longer than the planned two years.But Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, warned that the UK could face an extra £4bn-£5bn Brexit ""divorce bill"" if the post-withdraw transition period extends beyond the EU's preferred end date of 31 December 2020.He said that the current £35-39bn agreement was intended to cover to the end of the current EU budget period at the end of 2020.For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he would like to see ""a customs union"" option on the table, which would ""solve some of the issues around Northern Ireland"" and enable the UK to influence future trade negotiations.Taking questions after a speech in London, he also said Labour would rather have a general election than a second referendum on Britain's EU membership because ""there needs to be a wider debate"" about the UK's future relationship with Europe.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry also told LBC that while Brexit meant the UK could not be in the customs union, a new agreement was needed: ""That we think is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union.""It could mean the PM faces the prospect of a Commons rebellion as Conservative MP Anna Soubry said she had cross-party support for an amendment to the trade bill, calling for the government to form ""a"" customs union with the EU after Brexit."
2018-02-24,RBS reports first profit in 10 years,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43166560,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowRoyal Bank of Scotland has returned to profit for the first time in a decade as it continues its recovery.Chief executive Ross McEwan told the BBC it was ""a really symbolic moment.""The bank, which is majority-owned by the taxpayer, made an annual profit of £752m compared with a £6.95bn loss the year before.RBS still faces a potentially massive fine from the US Department of Justice over the sale of financial products linked to risky mortgages.RBS expanded rapidly in the boom years of the 2000s, and in October 2007 led a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for a massive £49bn, one of the largest deals in financial services history.However, the timing of this deal turned out to be unfortunate.A crisis swept through the financial sector, property prices plunged, economies fell into recession and banks lost billions.At the height of the crisis, in October 2008, the Treasury had to step in to bail RBS out for £45bn.Since the bank has been trying to get itself back into financial health. In 2013, Ross McEwan became chief executive, and he has turned the bank away from investment banking and towards UK High Street banking.By BBC economics editor, Kamal AhmedAfter nine years when accumulated losses totalled £58bn pounds - today a symbolic profit for RBS.Does it mean the government can start planning more confidently about selling the 71% stake it holds on behalf of the taxpayer?The fact the share price went down this morning by nearly 5% suggests not.Investors are still nervous about the multi-billion pound fine the bank is expecting from the US.At 269p, the RBS share price is still a long way below the 502p a share the government would need to break even on the billions of pounds it spent bailing out the bank a decade ago.It has already sold some of its stake at a loss - and will have to continue on that path for a long period yet, in the hope that eventually the share price will rise above that 502p and, overall, a profit can be made.Ross McEwan told me it would take three to five years before the government would have a ""much smaller"" level of ownership.Selling the taxpayers' stake in RBS has proved a much tougher and longer process than anyone imagined a decade ago.The sub-prime mortgage crisis came about after banks started giving high-risk loans to people with poor credit histories.Risky mortgages would be packaged up with other loans, bonds, or assets, and sold on to investors as so-called mortgage backed securities.RBS was one of the banks accused by the US Department of Justice of mis-selling these securities.The bank had expected to settle the case in 2017, but is now hoping it will reach an agreement this year.On Friday RBS set aside an extra £492m for US litigation, taking the total set aside for US court action around the sale of those products to £3.2bn.The issue complicates UK government plans to start selling down its stake in RBS.""We have been constantly hit with the sins of the past with conduct and litigation issues and I've been heavily restructuring the business to bring it back to the UK,"" Mr McEwan said.On Tuesday, after months of wrangling, MPs released a report by the financial regulator which said a unit of RBS mistreated thousands of small firms.The Global Restructuring Group (GRG) was marketed as an expert service that could save a business, but according to the report took ""inappropriate"" action. Mr McEwan said the report ""did make for really tough reading"".""We did not get it right for customers at the time they needed us when their businesses were struggling,"" he said.""We just didn't look after them well enough"".The bank has now put in place a complaints process overseen by a former high court judge, Mr McEwan added.For the first time, RBS published the average pay gap between men and women in the bank, which it said was at 37.2%.""Our gender pay gap reflects an under-representation of women at senior levels,"" the bank said in its annual report.""That is not a satisfactory position and we know that we still have much to do to narrow the gap."""

A great reforming home secretary, a much-admired chancellor, a great European and somebody whose values and life that in many ways I have followed"".Roy Harris Jenkins was born in 1920 and was the product of the mining valleys of south Wales. A grammar school boy, who went on to win a first at Oxford.He was immersed in politics from an early age, following in his father's footsteps and becoming a Labour MP in 1948. As home secretary in the Labour government of the mid-1960s, Roy Jenkins oversaw some of the great social reforms of the 20th Century, including abortion rights, divorce, and the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. As a student, the young Vince Cable felt a great admiration for what Jenkins had achieved,""This was the era of Mary Whitehouse, an attempt to restore old fashioned values ... there was this enormous sort of mood, particularly amongst young people to sweep away all the rather old fashioned values which seemed to exist at that time ... and he, more than anybody else, lifted the barriers. ""It changed the face of the country, it modernised it, in a way that we would regard as perfectly normal today"".His experiences during World War II, first in the Royal Artillery and then as a code breaker at Bletchley Park, made him a passionate European. He would defy many in his party and campaign for membership in the 1975 referendum, leaving UK politics to become president of the European Commission two years later. What would Lord Jenkins make of Brexit Britain?""People of his generation were people who had fought in the war, who saw the rebuilding of Europe as something that was a political objective to end conflict in Europe ... I think he would be a very, very sad heartbroken man, if he saw what had happened today"".Lord Jenkins is often described as a ""bon viveur"" and it is in his celebrated love of the ""good life"" that Sir Vince sees the greatest difference in their characters,""My lifestyle is a little bit different, I'm probably a bit more puritanical, a bit more frugal. He liked the big long lunch, which became, I think, rather celebrated. A great lover of high class wines - I never really got into that.""But he did greatly respect Lord Jenkins's approach to politics and his relationships across the political divide, including leading Conservative politicians and well-known ""lefties"" like Tony Benn.""I did respect that in him, he had a good relationships right across the spectrum. Those were days when MPs used to write each other private letters of congratulation and condolence, and there was a kind of civilised environment.""Returning from Europe some years later, Roy Jenkins felt a growing alienation from the Labour Party as it swung to the left under the leadership of Michael Foot.In 1981, he and the other prominent ""moderates"" known as the Gang of Four would leave to set up the Social Democratic Party. A certain Vince Cable was among the Labour converts, ""What was most difficult, I think, for him and also for many of us was the break with many of the other so-called ""moderates"" in the Labour Party. ""One of his closest associates, Anthony Crosland, who had actually been his lover when they were at university together, and Roy Hattersley and people of that kind ... it was bitter for many years.""The SDP would later merge with the Liberals, to form the Liberal Democrats, and while many in the Labour movement believed Lord Jenkins had betrayed his party and his roots, Sir Vince thinks, on balance, it was a decision based on principle, for the national good.""Historians will argue for many, many years as to whether the breakaway was justified. I think, actually, the Labour Party modernisation which started under Neil Kinnock through John Smith to Tony Blair probably wouldn't have happened, if it hadn't been for the SDP breakaway.""And I think British politics is much the better for having had the Lib Dems, of which he was one of the parents.""In his later years as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Roy Jenkins would advise Tony Blair as the New Labour project took form.As chancellor of Oxford University for more than 16 years, he would continue to write the acclaimed political biographies which he'd produced throughout his life. Married to wife Jennifer for nearly six decades, he died in 2003, at the age of 82. ""I think he was one of the great statesmen of the post war era,"" Sir Vince said.""You can read his legacy in his books. I think he fell short of what he ultimately wanted to achieve, he never became prime minister, his vision of the SDP Liberal Alliance never led to government as he had hoped, but he was a genuinely great figure in post-war British politics."""
2018-02-24,Labouring over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43163354,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt had been billed as an away day to thrash out Labour's policy on Brexit - a kind of shadow of the Chequers gathering. In the end when Labour's Brexit sub-committee met this week, it wasn't ""away"" from Westminster and it wasn't a day. A paper was tabled but not formally endorsed.But I'm told that nuances have been ironed out and it has all but got the approval of the party leadership. It will form the basis of Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit speech on Monday.What is he likely to say? Labour insiders favour the word ""evolution"" to describe any change. Contrary to speculation, there won't be a seismic shift in policy but it will move forward.In the summer, under pressure from some of his MPs, unions and his shadow Brexit secretary Mr Corbyn signed up to a policy of staying both in the single market  and the customs union for any ""transitional"" period after Brexit.The Labour position has been to argue that ""a"" customs union was ""a viable option"" and that the government should ""keep all options open"".What we are likely to see on Monday is wording that makes plain that ""a"" not ""the"" customs union would have distinct benefits and is the most logical way to solve the thorny issue of the Irish border. It won't just be a viable option but a viable end point. And the policy is likely to evolve in another way too.Currently Labour recognises that when we are out of the EU, we are out of the single market. So it is arguing that it wants to retain the same benefits as single market membership - such as tariff-free trade.I'm told the same formulation could be applied to ""a"" customs union, that in the long term a future Labour government could sign up to one, if the UK got the exact same benefits as it gets from ""the"" customs union - frictionless trade and a say over the external tariff on imported goods.As Labour has talked about the benefits of some form of customs union before, this would be an incremental not dramatic move forward.However party insiders say that Jeremy Corbyn can't guarantee that a future Labour government would definitely be in such a customs union because it would have to be negotiated with the EU. But one insider said that people listening on Monday will have no doubt where Labour is headed: That a customs union is the preferred option. Speaking on LBC radio, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry gave credence to this by saying: ""We have to negotiate a new agreement. That, we think, is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" While this would give the UK the current customs union's benefits, it would also have to take the burdens - including severe limitations on negotiating new non-EU trade deals.However one Labour strategist warned that when it comes to Brexit policy, there are ""many trees in the forest"". The customs union may rise like a redwood in the forthcoming Corbyn speech, but it's worth looking at what else is growing and developing at the same time.If Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer is to be happy with the evolving policy - and I'm told he is - there will have to be words about how close the UK should stick to the EU economically and socially in order to get some of the benefits of the single market. So expect Mr Corbyn to re-emphasise that he would not undercut EU standards.Diane Abbott this week gave more detail on what Labour meant by a ""jobs first"" Brexit saying: ""Immigration is subordinate to our priorities which favour growth, jobs and prosperity.""In the past, Labour spokespeople have said they will accept the end of free movement when the transitional period finishes, but phrases such as ""easy movement"" have been bandied about - possibly an agreement that citizens could move between the UK and EU with minimum red tape to take up job offers, but not simply to look for work.Although a majority of Labour voters opposed Brexit, a significant minority backed it and so far the party's ambiguity doesn't seem to have dented its position in the polls.  So why give more clarity? For some, it is driven primarily by politics not economics.There was speculation that Labour might unequivocally commit to the customs union in order to inflict a government defeat - with Tory rebels' help - in the forthcoming trade and customs bill. While about 50 Labour MPs would vote to stay in ""the"" customs union, most so far haven't upset their leadership and have abstained when the issue has come up.  While a handful of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs would back the government, if the party leadership signalled to MPs to vote against it because Labour was now more sympathetic to a customs union as an end point, then Theresa May would be in danger of losing. For some Labour figures, the real aim of the ""evolution"" in Labour's policy is to prepare the ground for a much bigger issue. It is to create enough space between the government and opposition to allow Labour to credibly to vote down any deal that Theresa May brings back from Brussels and destabilise her in the process.So if she clings on, Labour will make her ""own"" any Brexit fallout. If she is toppled, they would call for an election. But to get there, Labour has to be clearer on the policy divide - and now we are seeing that open up, slowly, before our eyes."

Decisions made in London and Brussels will have profound consequences for the 250,000 people who live in the UK's 14 overseas territories - yet another thread of complexity in the Brexit process.Gibraltar has always had the potential to cause a Brexit bust-up, even though Article 50 is perhaps less important here than Article 10... of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.That was when Spain ceded sovereignty of the Rock to Britain - a decision it appears to have regretted ever since.Gibraltar voted 96% in favour of remaining in the EU. There was enormous shock in the territory when the UK voted to leave, taking Gibraltar with it.""The atmosphere of disaster and grief was absolutely palpable,"" recalls Marlene Hassan Nahon, an independent member of the Gibraltar parliament.""One of my good friends met me for breakfast. She was dressed in a black dress, crying her eyes out.""Britain's Overseas TerritoriesLocal businesses are beginning to get more used to the idea of operating outside the single market, especially after the government of Gibraltar revealed that roughly 90% of its financial services trade within the single market is actually with the UK.""Somehow we had not realised or considered it before,"" says Joe Garcia, a veteran local journalist who has been covering all things Gibraltar since the 1960s.""People who bet online in Britain, 60% of those bets actually come through Gibraltar, and it's the same with requests for car insurance. When you are out in Britain, look around. One out of every six cars is insured in Gibraltar.""But many of the people who work in the sector live across the border in Spain. And there are persistent fears about the potential for long delays at the border after Brexit, and about the future of the Rock's low tax regime, which Spain sees as unfair competition. ""They will probably try to use [Brexit] to get Gibraltar to stop being what they call a tax haven,"" says Spanish historian Mercedes Penalba-Sotorrio. ""I think one of the main priorities is to stop that.""But the most sensitive issue is Spain's long-standing claim for sovereignty - shared or otherwise - which is rejected outright by both the UK and Gibraltar itself.Suspicion was heightened after the remaining EU27 decided formally that no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without a bilateral agreement between Spain and the UK.Now that language is threatening to complicate negotiations on a transition period for the UK after Brexit.""To the frustration of Brussels and the rest of the EU,"" says Mujtaba Rahman of the political consultancy Eurasia Group, ""Madrid is now arguing that the transition represents one such agreement - and that the transition should not apply to Gibraltar unless Spain explicitly agrees, which it currently does not.""If Gibraltar feels under threat, at least it has some influential supporters in London. Last year The Sun updated its classic early 90s headline ""Up Yours Delors"" for the front-page benefit of Spain: ""Up Yours Senors"".But spare a thought for Britain's overseas territories with rather less clout. The Caribbean island of Anguilla has a sea border with the EU, and is fearful of the future. Devastated by Hurricane Irma last year, and dependent on neighbouring islands, it is now bracing for Brexit.Anguilla's closest gateway to the world lies four miles across the sea in the French half of the island of St Martin, which is officially part of France, and therefore an ""outermost region"" of the EU. Anguilla relies on access to St Martin for many of its daily necessities - from food supplies to MRI scans to the postal service. The nearest international airport lies on the Dutch side of St Martin. ""We have a symbiotic relationship, and we really don't want Brexit to change it,"" says Blondel Cluff, the Anguillan government representative in London. ""But I don't think we've come up in the negotiations yet."" In a report published last year entitled ""Anguilla & Brexit: Britain's forgotten EU border"", the Anguillan government called for a regional customs union with St Martin and a common travel area. Anguilla is also mostly ineligible for British development aid, and is therefore highly dependent on money coming from the EU for more than a third of its budget.""I know it's difficult when we have a population the size of a British village,"" says Blondel Cluff, ""but we need to make sure we don't get forgotten in the mix."" It all means that even half way round the world Brexit is raising concerns about the freedom of movement of goods, of services, and of course of people. ""The fact that people in overseas territories are going to lose an important element of their citizenship, without having been asked about it, may well give rise to legal challenges in the future,"" says Susie Alegre, a lawyer specialising in the rights of citizens in the British Overseas Territories.Given the bewildering range of Brexit issues that need to be resolved, it is hardly surprising that the overseas territories have not received the attention they feel they deserve. But Susie Alegre believes that could change. ""It may well be - and particularly with the case of Gibraltar - that in the next year you'll suddenly see quite serious issues popping up out of these dots on the map."""
2018-02-24,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-24,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43113714,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: Cutting tuition fees for university students without changing anything else would make the system less progressive.Reality Check verdict: If no other parts of the system were changed, a simple cut in tuition fees would not help those lower-income graduates who would not repay their loans within 30 years and would help higher-income graduates who would repay them.  Former Conservative education secretary Nicky Morgan said on BBC Radio 4 that a blanket cut in tuition fees would make the system less progressive.A progressive system is one in which people pay more the richer they get. A system in which everybody pays the same regardless of their income or wealth would be described as regressive, because poorer people would pay a higher proportion of their income than richer ones.Under the current system, graduates have to pay 9% of their taxable pay above a certain level (£21,000 a year at the moment, rising to £25,000 later this year) in loan repayments.University tuition fees are a maximum of £9,250 a year in England; loans are also available to pay living costs and interest is charged on both.You make the repayments for 30 years from the April after you finish or leave your course, at which point any remaining debt is written off.So, if you go through that 30-year period without ever earning more than £25,000 in a year then you will never repay any of your loans and a cut in fees will make no difference to the amount you end up paying.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that 83% of graduates will not have paid off their loans in full by the end of the 30 years.Consider how a cut in fees would affect three groups of graduates - those who would never have paid off their loans within 30 years, those who would always have paid them off within 30 years and those who would only be able to pay within 30 years following a cut in fees.There will be no change for the people in the first group, which contains the poorest graduates - they will still pay 9% of their income over £21,000 or £25,000 for 30 years.The second group and third groups - the higher-earning graduates - would benefit because they get to stop paying sooner.If the lowest-earning graduates are the only ones who do not benefit then you cannot call the change progressive.Now, all this assumes that nothing else about the system changes - clearly there are systems that would be able to cut fees in a progressive way.It's also important to bear in mind that there are psychological factors involved, so people might be unwilling to become £50,000 in debt even if the system means they are unlikely to have to pay it all off.It should be said that applications to university, even among the poorest students, have continued rising despite rising tuition fees. In Scotland, there are no fees for Scottish students. In Northern Ireland, fees are up to £4,030 a year. In Wales, fees are up to £9,000, but there are plans for higher levels of maintenance support.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-24,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-24,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180224191532/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?""Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals.Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position.Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved.Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland.He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU.""By BBC Political Correspondent Emma VardyLabour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify.Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union.On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority.But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy.It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government.The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger.Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves.He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England.And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"".The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union.Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"".Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench.He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place.""In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations.""More than 80 senior figures in the Labour Party have, meanwhile, urged Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU single market after Brexit.In a statement seen by the Observer, figures including Lord Mandelson, pro-European backbencher Chuka Umunna, former leader Lord Kinnock, and trade union leaders said the party as a minimum ""must clearly and unambiguously"" set out to remain part of the European economic area.Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit.Mr Umunna warned leaving the single market and customs union would ""torpedo"" Labour's anti-austerity and industrial investment plans."

On Saturday, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald welcomed the announcement that the US was discussing a new special envoy.""The appointment of an envoy reflects the positive role that America has played in the peace process,"" she said. ""This is particularly significant as the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement approaches.""Mr Tillerson previously said he would abolish international special envoy positions.

Ecuador is willing, but not necessarily the other party"".She said her country would ""continue looking for mechanisms"" to end the stalemate.But a spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: ""Ecuador knows that the way to resolve this issue is for Julian Assange to leave the embassy to face justice""Last December, Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship in a move which the country hoped could give him immunity in the UK.But the UK does not recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent and continues to insist he should ""face justice"".There is no extradition treaty between the UK and Ecuador so he cannot be arrested inside the embassy.Mr Assange breached bail conditions when he sought refuge at the Ecuadorean embassy six years ago. He faced questioning over sexual assault allegations in Sweden, which have since been dropped.Previously, Mr Assange has justified his decision to break bail conditions arguing if he faced the Swedish authorities he would be extradited to the US over the publication of classified documents."

Germany and France have warned any funding cuts to EU programmes could damage efforts to tackle illegal immigration and terrorism.Speaking after the meeting, Mr Tusk said leaders had agreed to spend more on security, as well as fighting illegal migration in their next long-term budget.He said many of the EU leaders were ready to contribute more to the pot, but acknowledged others were less forthcoming.Deciding how to fill the budgetary hole that Brexit will leave is problematic, says the BBC's Kevin Connolly, as net contributors such as Austria and the Netherlands take a sharply different view from net beneficiaries such as Poland and Greece. While wealthier Northern countries make the case for a reduced budget, poorer member states in eastern and southern Europe are unhappy about the possibility of cuts to programme funding.Ahead of Friday's talks, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had said he was concerned about a ""rift between east and west"". ""Sometimes it gets wider and sometimes differences are bridged. I don't want any new divisions in Europe. We've had enough of those.""By Kevin Connolly, BBC News, BrusselsEU budget problems are not fixed in a single afternoon of talks - agreeing how much the organisation should collect from member states after Brexit will take months.There's a clear division between the rich countries, who don't want to fix the post-Brexit shortfall by paying more, and the poor countries, who don't want to bridge it by taking less.And all the while, like the rumble of gunfire from a neighbouring battlefield, the Brexit issue hangs in the air here. Plenty of European leaders have said that progress can't be made until they have more clarity and certainty from the British side. Separately, it was also announced that the UK Prime Minister Theresa May is to deliver long-awaited speech setting out her vision for the UK's future relationship with the EU on 2 March. Speaking on Friday, Mr Tusk said EU leaders planned to push ahead with the release of their own joint stance for future relations in March, whether Britain is ready or not. He said the bloc would be ""extremely realistic in our assessment of possible new proposals"", while labelling the UK's approach to the negotiations as ""pure illusion""."
2018-02-25,MPs back bid to change organ donation laws,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43168524,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPlans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England, which it is claimed could save up to 500 lives a year, have been backed by MPs. A bill requiring people to ""opt out"" if they do not want their organs used passed its first parliamentary hurdle.Labour's Julie Elliott, whose daughter is receiving dialysis for a serious kidney disease, said it would give hope to thousands of transplant patients.The MP said her experience had made her realise how ""special"" donors were. Labour MP Geoffrey Robinson's private members' bill, which would bring England into line with Wales which already has an opt-out system for consent, passed its second reading on Friday.The government has said it ""wholeheartedly"" supported the bill, which it said would be referred to the changes as Max's Law, after nine-year-old Max Johnson, who benefited from a heart transplant.People like @vancole9 are living proof of why action & change on organ donation is needed – today I backed @geoffrey4covNW’s bill as a first step towards the life-saving reforms we need. https://t.co/F171IkXyaJ https://t.co/tcH0GY0n72End of Twitter post  by @Jeremy_HuntThere are 25 million people on the organ donation register but 6,500 patients are waiting for a transplant.At the moment in England, organs can only be used if explicit approval is given, either by signing the register or if the deceased had told a family member of their desire to donate. The UK government is consulting on introducing an opt-out system while Scotland is currently looking at bringing forward similar legislation. Mr Robinson told MPs that while levels of organ donation were considerably higher than a decade ago, the UK had some of the lowest rates of consent in Western Europe and a ""certain inertia"" had set in. According to NHS figures, he said about 500 people were dying every year due to a lack of suitable donors.""This is not good enough. I believe we can do better and be pioneers in making transplants more effective.""While changing the law would ""not make an immediate difference"", he said if the bill was passed by the end of the year it would increase the availability of organs over time and help give more people ""a new lease of life"". He also said he hoped it would make it easier for families to openly discuss the issue.""None of us likes to think about the worst happening,"" he said. ""It is challenging to have conversations with loved ones about their wishes after death.""We know that it is at that moment when families are confronted with the awful situation that very often they back off, sometimes over-riding the wishes of the deceased who happens to be a registered donor.""Ms Elliott, the MP for Sunderland Central, said her family's life had been transformed by her previously healthy 36-year old daughter Rebecca's diagnosis with a serious kidney complaint in late 2016.""What happened to us over the last 18 months could happen to anyone, rich or poor... and highlights the reality of the need to change the law to a position of deemed consent,"" she said.""From hopefully one day the family member of a recipient, I want to say (to donors) thank you very much from the bottom of my heart - you are very special people.""""Let us make the change in the law to save more lives of the thousands waiting for transplants.""Under the bill's ""soft opt-out"" proposals, the wishes of families and next of kin would continue to be respected, so removal of organs would not go ahead without their support.There would be exemptions for under-18s and adults not able to make informed decisions. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made a brief appearance in the Commons to urge MPs to support the ""wonderful"" measure which he said would ""save an awful lot of people's lives"".In Wales, where an opt-out system was introduced in December 2015, there has actually been a small dip in the number of deceased donors, from 64 in 2015-16 to 61 in 2016-17. This resulted in a drop in organ transplants from 214 to 187 respectively. Former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said it would be wrong to describe the experience in Wales as a failure.But the Conservative MP said families should have a ""certain latitude"" to change their mind at what was obviously a very sensitive time following the death of a loved-one.

He said that being in the EU meant there were ""some steps we might want to take environmentally that we can't yet.""But Vice-President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said the EU was already ahead of the UK on Twitter:.@michaelgove One step ahead of you.

According to the campaign group, Refuse The Straw, plastic straws take over 200 years to break down.  In January the Prime Minister Theresa May said she wanted to eliminate all avoidable plastic within 25 years.A number of restaurants including JD Wetherspoon, Wagamama and Pizza Express have announced that plastic straws would be phased out or only made available on request. The Queen has also sought to reduce plastic straw usage at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.However, a disability group has expressed concerns about the move to ban plastic straws.The Scottish campaigning group, One in Five, has said organisations were ""racing ahead"" to respond to ""understandable environmental concerns"" without having ""fully considered the needs of some disabled people"".The group argues that paper straws cannot be used for hot drinks and that metal straws could be dangerous for those with Parkinson's.The recent BBC documentary Blue Planet II, narrated by David Attenborough, highlighted the damage caused by plastic in the sea.This included a case of a pilot whale calf which is thought to have died after consuming its mother's milk contaminated with toxic chemicals from plastic.Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morningA government spokesman said: ""We are committed through our 25-year environment plan to eliminating avoidable plastic altogether by the end of 2042 so we leave our planet in a better state than we found it.""""We are exploring a range of options, and have already introduced a world-leading ban on microbeads, and set out plans to extend the 5p plastic bag charge, improve recycling rates and explore plastic-free aisles in supermarkets."""

2018-02-25,Cold War tales,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43168245,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMuch of the news in the UK this week has been driven by allegations by a former Czechoslovak spy that the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was a paid informer for the country's communist era secret police, the StB.Mr Corbyn emphatically denies the claims. Indeed all the evidence suggests he was never anything more than a person of interest to the StB. But as Rob Cameron reports from Prague, while the Cold War is over, a few sheaves of yellowing paper still have the power to throw lives into turmoil.As I sat at my computer, poring over secret police files, I felt a sudden tug of nostalgia. The files were digital copies of reports written by StB officer Jan Sarkocy, sent to Britain in 1986 under diplomatic cover. When he met first Jeremy Corbyn, in November of that year, his business card read ""Jan Dymic, Third Secretary to the Czechoslovak Embassy in London"".They were fascinating documents, cryptic and - for me - strangely evocative. Especially the references to North London landmarks I knew well, such as Seven Sisters Road, where the Labour MP for Islington had an office. But my task was not to dredge up my own memories of Labour politics while the party was in opposition in the 1980s. Rather it was to examine the six documents in dossier number 12801/subsection 326, codename ""COB"", for traces of anything incriminating. And believe me, I couldn't find them. Nothing in Agent Dymic's descriptions of three meetings with the Labour MP - two in the House of Commons, one on Seven Sisters Road - suggest the StB ever regarded him as anything other than a potential source. A young leftist with good contacts in the peace movement. An internationalist with a Chilean wife who kept dogs and goldfish. The only document he appears to have passed on to Agent Dymic was a photocopy of an article in the Sunday People about a bungled MI5 raid on the East German Embassy. And each meticulous report ended with a little note of expenses incurred; parking, two pounds; underground ticket, one pound. Signed: Jan Dymic. For clarity I spent a morning with the woman who is now the custodian of millions of documents still marked ""TOP SECRET"": the Director of the Czech Security Services Archive. For research purposes these dossiers - once jealously guarded by the Communist-era secret police and intelligence services - are now freely available to anyone; all you have to do is ask for them. The director had also given me Dymic's own personnel file. But his Slovak was littered with arcane abbreviations and jargon, and I was having trouble understanding them. ""COB"" was Jeremy Corbyn's codename, that much was obvious. Nothing sinister in that, she told me; the StB used them for everyone, including people they were interested in cultivating.OK, but what were ""GREENHOUSE I"" and ""GREENHOUSE II"" - mentioned repeatedly in the files? The Czechoslovaks seemed obsessed with trying to penetrate these targets, and many of Dymic's approaches to British politicians - Jeremy Corbyn among them - were initiated with the aim of gaining access to them. ""GREENHOUSE…"" the director frowned, peering at the screen. ""I'm sorry...."" she admitted, after a few minutes. ""I've really got no idea.""Two days later, speeding down the motorway to Slovakia, I made a mental note to ask Agent Dymic - now just Jan Sarkocy - what this ""GREENHOUSE"" was. I had mixed feelings about this meeting, secured after many emails and texts. At home, the StB were the praetorian guard of Czechoslovak communism, responsible for hounding dissidents, torturing priests, and spying on a cowed population. Today, the epithet ""estebak"" - an StB officer - is still a term of abuse. They also had several high-profile successes abroad; recruiting two Labour MPs from the UK in the 1950s and 60s. Their rivals in military intelligence even recruited a Conservative one.After a huddle outside his house with Slovak reporters - where he made his explosive claims - Sarkocy had gone to ground, and was no longer talking. But finally, he relented, and so I now found myself outside his home in the village of Limbach, about half an hour north of Bratislava.A thick layer of snow lay on the ground as we waited for him to answer the door. Lines from John Le Carre novels filled my head. ""It is cold in Limbach at this time of the year,"" I said in an exaggerated East European accent, to ease the tension. My Czech colleague - there to film the interview - laughed.In the end Jan Sarkocy was garrulous and friendly, still regarding his brief tenure in London with great affection. Most of what he told me, about an array of people and institutions, was so libellous - not to mention confusing - that I cannot even begin to repeat it here. But oddly not even he could remember what GREENHOUSE I and GREENHOUSE II were.The answer finally came from a BBC colleague. ""I've made some calls,"" he wrote. ""The main effort of the StB abroad, as directed by their Russian masters, was to penetrate the UK's intelligence agencies. So GREENHOUSE I was probably Century House, the former headquarters of the SIS, more commonly known as MI6."" Ah. And GREENHOUSE II was, I suppose, the headquarters of MI5.The GREENHOUSE mystery solved, and the Corbyn frenzy dying down in London, I boarded a train back to Prague. As the 12:10 from Bratislava sped through the frozen fields, my head still spinning, I did what any journalist does at the end of a story: my expenses. Parking; two euros. Tram ticket: one. I suddenly had an image of Jan Sarkocy doing his in London 30 years ago.A different job. A different era. But some things, I suppose, never change."

A great reforming home secretary, a much-admired chancellor, a great European and somebody whose values and life that in many ways I have followed"".Roy Harris Jenkins was born in 1920 and was the product of the mining valleys of south Wales. A grammar school boy, who went on to win a first at Oxford.He was immersed in politics from an early age, following in his father's footsteps and becoming a Labour MP in 1948. As home secretary in the Labour government of the mid-1960s, Roy Jenkins oversaw some of the great social reforms of the 20th Century, including abortion rights, divorce, and the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. As a student, the young Vince Cable felt a great admiration for what Jenkins had achieved,""This was the era of Mary Whitehouse, an attempt to restore old fashioned values ... there was this enormous sort of mood, particularly amongst young people to sweep away all the rather old fashioned values which seemed to exist at that time ... and he, more than anybody else, lifted the barriers. ""It changed the face of the country, it modernised it, in a way that we would regard as perfectly normal today"".His experiences during World War II, first in the Royal Artillery and then as a code breaker at Bletchley Park, made him a passionate European. He would defy many in his party and campaign for membership in the 1975 referendum, leaving UK politics to become president of the European Commission two years later. What would Lord Jenkins make of Brexit Britain?""People of his generation were people who had fought in the war, who saw the rebuilding of Europe as something that was a political objective to end conflict in Europe ... I think he would be a very, very sad heartbroken man, if he saw what had happened today"".Lord Jenkins is often described as a ""bon viveur"" and it is in his celebrated love of the ""good life"" that Sir Vince sees the greatest difference in their characters,""My lifestyle is a little bit different, I'm probably a bit more puritanical, a bit more frugal. He liked the big long lunch, which became, I think, rather celebrated. A great lover of high class wines - I never really got into that.""But he did greatly respect Lord Jenkins's approach to politics and his relationships across the political divide, including leading Conservative politicians and well-known ""lefties"" like Tony Benn.""I did respect that in him, he had a good relationships right across the spectrum. Those were days when MPs used to write each other private letters of congratulation and condolence, and there was a kind of civilised environment.""Returning from Europe some years later, Roy Jenkins felt a growing alienation from the Labour Party as it swung to the left under the leadership of Michael Foot.In 1981, he and the other prominent ""moderates"" known as the Gang of Four would leave to set up the Social Democratic Party. A certain Vince Cable was among the Labour converts, ""What was most difficult, I think, for him and also for many of us was the break with many of the other so-called ""moderates"" in the Labour Party. ""One of his closest associates, Anthony Crosland, who had actually been his lover when they were at university together, and Roy Hattersley and people of that kind ... it was bitter for many years.""The SDP would later merge with the Liberals, to form the Liberal Democrats, and while many in the Labour movement believed Lord Jenkins had betrayed his party and his roots, Sir Vince thinks, on balance, it was a decision based on principle, for the national good.""Historians will argue for many, many years as to whether the breakaway was justified. I think, actually, the Labour Party modernisation which started under Neil Kinnock through John Smith to Tony Blair probably wouldn't have happened, if it hadn't been for the SDP breakaway.""And I think British politics is much the better for having had the Lib Dems, of which he was one of the parents.""In his later years as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Roy Jenkins would advise Tony Blair as the New Labour project took form.As chancellor of Oxford University for more than 16 years, he would continue to write the acclaimed political biographies which he'd produced throughout his life. Married to wife Jennifer for nearly six decades, he died in 2003, at the age of 82. ""I think he was one of the great statesmen of the post war era,"" Sir Vince said.""You can read his legacy in his books. I think he fell short of what he ultimately wanted to achieve, he never became prime minister, his vision of the SDP Liberal Alliance never led to government as he had hoped, but he was a genuinely great figure in post-war British politics."""
2018-02-25,Labouring over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43163354,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt had been billed as an away day to thrash out Labour's policy on Brexit - a kind of shadow of the Chequers gathering. In the end when Labour's Brexit sub-committee met this week, it wasn't ""away"" from Westminster and it wasn't a day. A paper was tabled but not formally endorsed.But I'm told that nuances have been ironed out and it has all but got the approval of the party leadership. It will form the basis of Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit speech on Monday.What is he likely to say? Labour insiders favour the word ""evolution"" to describe any change. Contrary to speculation, there won't be a seismic shift in policy but it will move forward.In the summer, under pressure from some of his MPs, unions and his shadow Brexit secretary Mr Corbyn signed up to a policy of staying both in the single market  and the customs union for any ""transitional"" period after Brexit.The Labour position has been to argue that ""a"" customs union was ""a viable option"" and that the government should ""keep all options open"".What we are likely to see on Monday is wording that makes plain that ""a"" not ""the"" customs union would have distinct benefits and is the most logical way to solve the thorny issue of the Irish border. It won't just be a viable option but a viable end point. And the policy is likely to evolve in another way too.Currently Labour recognises that when we are out of the EU, we are out of the single market. So it is arguing that it wants to retain the same benefits as single market membership - such as tariff-free trade.I'm told the same formulation could be applied to ""a"" customs union, that in the long term a future Labour government could sign up to one, if the UK got the exact same benefits as it gets from ""the"" customs union - frictionless trade and a say over the external tariff on imported goods.As Labour has talked about the benefits of some form of customs union before, this would be an incremental not dramatic move forward.However party insiders say that Jeremy Corbyn can't guarantee that a future Labour government would definitely be in such a customs union because it would have to be negotiated with the EU. But one insider said that people listening on Monday will have no doubt where Labour is headed: That a customs union is the preferred option. Speaking on LBC radio, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry gave credence to this by saying: ""We have to negotiate a new agreement. That, we think, is likely to be a customs union that will look pretty much like the current customs union."" While this would give the UK the current customs union's benefits, it would also have to take the burdens - including severe limitations on negotiating new non-EU trade deals.However one Labour strategist warned that when it comes to Brexit policy, there are ""many trees in the forest"". The customs union may rise like a redwood in the forthcoming Corbyn speech, but it's worth looking at what else is growing and developing at the same time.If Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer is to be happy with the evolving policy - and I'm told he is - there will have to be words about how close the UK should stick to the EU economically and socially in order to get some of the benefits of the single market. So expect Mr Corbyn to re-emphasise that he would not undercut EU standards.Diane Abbott this week gave more detail on what Labour meant by a ""jobs first"" Brexit saying: ""Immigration is subordinate to our priorities which favour growth, jobs and prosperity.""In the past, Labour spokespeople have said they will accept the end of free movement when the transitional period finishes, but phrases such as ""easy movement"" have been bandied about - possibly an agreement that citizens could move between the UK and EU with minimum red tape to take up job offers, but not simply to look for work.Although a majority of Labour voters opposed Brexit, a significant minority backed it and so far the party's ambiguity doesn't seem to have dented its position in the polls.  So why give more clarity? For some, it is driven primarily by politics not economics.There was speculation that Labour might unequivocally commit to the customs union in order to inflict a government defeat - with Tory rebels' help - in the forthcoming trade and customs bill. While about 50 Labour MPs would vote to stay in ""the"" customs union, most so far haven't upset their leadership and have abstained when the issue has come up.  While a handful of Brexit-supporting Labour MPs would back the government, if the party leadership signalled to MPs to vote against it because Labour was now more sympathetic to a customs union as an end point, then Theresa May would be in danger of losing. For some Labour figures, the real aim of the ""evolution"" in Labour's policy is to prepare the ground for a much bigger issue. It is to create enough space between the government and opposition to allow Labour to credibly to vote down any deal that Theresa May brings back from Brussels and destabilise her in the process.So if she clings on, Labour will make her ""own"" any Brexit fallout. If she is toppled, they would call for an election. But to get there, Labour has to be clearer on the policy divide - and now we are seeing that open up, slowly, before our eyes."

Decisions made in London and Brussels will have profound consequences for the 250,000 people who live in the UK's 14 overseas territories - yet another thread of complexity in the Brexit process.Gibraltar has always had the potential to cause a Brexit bust-up, even though Article 50 is perhaps less important here than Article 10... of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.That was when Spain ceded sovereignty of the Rock to Britain - a decision it appears to have regretted ever since.Gibraltar voted 96% in favour of remaining in the EU. There was enormous shock in the territory when the UK voted to leave, taking Gibraltar with it.""The atmosphere of disaster and grief was absolutely palpable,"" recalls Marlene Hassan Nahon, an independent member of the Gibraltar parliament.""One of my good friends met me for breakfast. She was dressed in a black dress, crying her eyes out.""Britain's Overseas TerritoriesLocal businesses are beginning to get more used to the idea of operating outside the single market, especially after the government of Gibraltar revealed that roughly 90% of its financial services trade within the single market is actually with the UK.""Somehow we had not realised or considered it before,"" says Joe Garcia, a veteran local journalist who has been covering all things Gibraltar since the 1960s.""People who bet online in Britain, 60% of those bets actually come through Gibraltar, and it's the same with requests for car insurance. When you are out in Britain, look around. One out of every six cars is insured in Gibraltar.""But many of the people who work in the sector live across the border in Spain. And there are persistent fears about the potential for long delays at the border after Brexit, and about the future of the Rock's low tax regime, which Spain sees as unfair competition. ""They will probably try to use [Brexit] to get Gibraltar to stop being what they call a tax haven,"" says Spanish historian Mercedes Penalba-Sotorrio. ""I think one of the main priorities is to stop that.""But the most sensitive issue is Spain's long-standing claim for sovereignty - shared or otherwise - which is rejected outright by both the UK and Gibraltar itself.Suspicion was heightened after the remaining EU27 decided formally that no agreement between the EU and the UK may apply to Gibraltar without a bilateral agreement between Spain and the UK.Now that language is threatening to complicate negotiations on a transition period for the UK after Brexit.""To the frustration of Brussels and the rest of the EU,"" says Mujtaba Rahman of the political consultancy Eurasia Group, ""Madrid is now arguing that the transition represents one such agreement - and that the transition should not apply to Gibraltar unless Spain explicitly agrees, which it currently does not.""If Gibraltar feels under threat, at least it has some influential supporters in London. Last year The Sun updated its classic early 90s headline ""Up Yours Delors"" for the front-page benefit of Spain: ""Up Yours Senors"".But spare a thought for Britain's overseas territories with rather less clout. The Caribbean island of Anguilla has a sea border with the EU, and is fearful of the future. Devastated by Hurricane Irma last year, and dependent on neighbouring islands, it is now bracing for Brexit.Anguilla's closest gateway to the world lies four miles across the sea in the French half of the island of St Martin, which is officially part of France, and therefore an ""outermost region"" of the EU. Anguilla relies on access to St Martin for many of its daily necessities - from food supplies to MRI scans to the postal service. The nearest international airport lies on the Dutch side of St Martin. ""We have a symbiotic relationship, and we really don't want Brexit to change it,"" says Blondel Cluff, the Anguillan government representative in London. ""But I don't think we've come up in the negotiations yet."" In a report published last year entitled ""Anguilla & Brexit: Britain's forgotten EU border"", the Anguillan government called for a regional customs union with St Martin and a common travel area. Anguilla is also mostly ineligible for British development aid, and is therefore highly dependent on money coming from the EU for more than a third of its budget.""I know it's difficult when we have a population the size of a British village,"" says Blondel Cluff, ""but we need to make sure we don't get forgotten in the mix."" It all means that even half way round the world Brexit is raising concerns about the freedom of movement of goods, of services, and of course of people. ""The fact that people in overseas territories are going to lose an important element of their citizenship, without having been asked about it, may well give rise to legal challenges in the future,"" says Susie Alegre, a lawyer specialising in the rights of citizens in the British Overseas Territories.Given the bewildering range of Brexit issues that need to be resolved, it is hardly surprising that the overseas territories have not received the attention they feel they deserve. But Susie Alegre believes that could change. ""It may well be - and particularly with the case of Gibraltar - that in the next year you'll suddenly see quite serious issues popping up out of these dots on the map."""
2018-02-25,Education review,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43120280,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA library in a thriving college in Derby might have felt like the perfect location for the prime minister's official start of a review of education that has been promised several times before.She was here to show she wants to act, to sort out one of the problems the country faces. But at half term, the college was largely empty of students, the invited audience largely made up of education bigwigs rather than younger people whose lives might actually be affected by the decisions.In the unlikely event that Westminster's sketch writers would be short of metaphors the choice of venue and audience perhaps provided a convenient flavour for their spiky paragraphs on Tuesday.There are plenty of good reasons why the prime minister chose to hold this review. Full time student numbers have gone up and up and up. But so have fees, and the level of debt students face after university in England has multiplied too.With the scrapping of student maintenance grants, students from less well-off backgrounds are finishing up with higher debts.The number of students doing part-time courses has dropped significantly, and while good quality apprenticeships and training are often feverishly oversubscribed, there is and has been (certainly in political circles) an assumption that university is the the premium choice for 18-year-olds.Theresa May wants to get rid of that assumption (although she is certainly not the first prime minister I have heard outline that demand in a speech)And politically, the Tories are looking for ways to show they are serious about addressing the tension between generations. It may be rather over-eager for any Conservative to imagine they can compete on a big scale with the Labour offer to get rid of fees altogether, but feeling parents' and grandparents' pain too is clearly an aim.And Theresa May wants to demonstrate there is more to her government than the bureaucratic and political tangle of Brexit.Reading that list of motivations - so far, so tempting. But you'd be forgiven for wondering if the review might in the end be, well, as half-empty as the college today.At times it was as if the prime minister had only just realised, or heard of the problems in higher education when, of course the Tories have been in charge for seven years while fees have gone up.Many would argue though that the fee increases are in fact the reason why universities have been able to grow so much, and the number-crunchers at the IFS show that the best paid graduates pay more of the burden in the long term.More recently, there have already been very significant reforms to the education sector, in fact on Theresa May's watch. The Department for Education has already pushed for shorter courses and for more information about the quality of degrees to be made available, and new technical qualifications, T-levels, are already on the way.Since the election Number 10 has already made a few tweaks to the fees system. And while the prime minister emphasised again and again she wants this to be a wide review, its terms of reference (the small print) make clear there won't be a big shift on how education is paid for, nor any big extra promises of cash.For better or for worse, that means the review appears therefore to be looking at moving money around inside the sector.That doesn't meant there won't be any change. Cutting the cost of some degrees is on the cards, and there was a heavy hint from the PM that the maintenance grant might come back (one university boss lamented afterwards that the government could just do this straight away rather than spend another year concluding it was a relatively inexpensive no-brainer).But the review seems unlikely to be recommending massive upheavals, certainly not anything like the demands we heard from students at nearby Derby University today.It's abundantly crystal clear the Tories won't go near the kind of solution being put forward by the Labour Party that seemed to drive so much support their way in the general election.Yes, ministers are worried about the way the higher education system works, the levels of debt that some students face.But don't mistake today's announcement as a sudden Conservative conversion to something completely different. And while there is political opportunity in outlining promises, there are risks that in the end they look empty themselves."
2018-02-25,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. The party said at the 2017 election it wanted a ""jobs first"" deal.  What this means in practice is not yet set in stone - they have not ruled out being in a customs union or the single market after Brexit, with party leader Jeremy Corbyn saying he wants a ""tariff-free trade relationship"".These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-25,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180225184745/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

He said the UK would ""have to have a meaningful say"" in post-Brexit trade negotiations with the EU ""so we would not end up as simply passive rule takers"".Asked what would happen if the EU said no to his proposal, he said ""we would continue talking to them because that's how you reach agreement"".He also denied claims by Eurosceptic Labour MPs that he had betrayed Labour voters who had backed Brexit, saying they did not vote ""to lose their jobs"" and the UK would still be leaving the EU under his plans.In his speech, at Coventry University, Mr Corbyn accused the Conservatives of having ""no economic plan and no plan for Brexit"" and said that under Labour there would be no ""scapegoating of migrants, no setting one generation against another and no playing off the nations of the UK"".He said Labour would be ""looking for a Brexit that puts the working people first"".Labour had already backed customs union membership during the planned two-year transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019. But in a shift from the party's policy at last year's general election, he said the UK should strike a new customs deal with the EU at the end of transition.  ""Labour would seek a final deal that gives full access to European markets and maintains the benefits of the single market and the customs union... with no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections,"" he said.""We have long argued that a customs union is a viable option for the final deal. So Labour would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to ensure that there are no tariffs with Europe and to help avoid any need for a hard border in Northern Ireland.""He added: ""Labour respects the result of the referendum and Britain is leaving the EU. But we will not support any Tory deal that would do lasting damage to jobs, rights and living standards.""The prime minister has insisted the UK will leave both the single market and the customs union, allowing it to negotiate its own post-Brexit trade deals.Mrs May will give details in a speech on Friday of how her plan for a ""managed diversion"" from the EU will work in practice, after first briefing the cabinet. The Conservatives accused Mr Corbyn of ""betraying millions of Labour voters"" who had backed Brexit.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said: ""Labour's confused policy would be bad for jobs and wages, it would leave us unable to sign up to comprehensive free trade deals, and it doesn't respect the result of the referendum.""This is another broken promise by Labour. Only the Conservatives are getting on with delivering what British people voted for, taking back control of our laws, borders and money.""Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson accused Mr Corbyn of raising a ""white flag"" on Brexit in order to try to defeat the government in an upcoming Commons vote on remaining in a customs union.Mr Johnson tweeted: ""Crumbling Corbyn betrays Leave voters - and all because he wants to win a Commons vote. Cynical and deluded.""A customs union allows free-flowing trade between member nations without making companies pay export taxes, or tariffs, at the border. However the members normally have joint trade agreements with countries not in their customs union.  A single market is a deeper form of co-operation, which effectively merges the economies of member states together, allowing the free movement of goods, services, money and people as if they were part of a single country.Mr Corbyn rejected calls from pro-EU figures like Lord Mandelson and a number of his own backbenchers to commit to staying in the EU single market, saying instead that he wanted a ""close relationship"" with it.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out continuing with free movement of people between the UK and the EU in some form after Brexit, under Labour's plans, but he told BBC News it would have to be negotiated - as would any financial contribution the UK would make.He said the UK could work ""jointly"" with the EU after Brexit to strike trade deals with other nations - something the government insists is not possible.Analysis By BBC political correspondent Ian Watson So the dividing lines are clear politically - if less clear in practice. Clear politically, because the government is committed to coming out of the customs union. And in contrast Labour now says it wants to negotiate ""a new comprehensive customs union"" with the EU.That puts clear blue water between opposition and government - and may signal to Remain voters that Labour wants a 'softer' Brexit, staying closer to the EU. Crucially, it would allow Labour to side with Tory rebels in any forthcoming votes in parliament on the issue - raising the prospect of a government defeat.But in practice, there may be fewer differences than meets the eye.  Jeremy Corbyn wants a customs union that would still give the UK a say in EU-led trade deals - which the EU may resist.And Theresa May has spoken of a new ""customs arrangement,"" which would, er, allow independent trade deals.  But it's currently in the government and opposition's political interests to emphasise the differences,  not the similarities. Jeremy Corbyn refused to be drawn on whether his policy shift was an attempt to remove Theresa May from office and force a general election.Tory rebels have been tight-lipped about whether they would vote against Mrs May if it came down to a confidence vote in her premiership, saying that was unlikely to happen. Labour's shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner was asked earlier about whether the shift could lead to an election, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't know what it would lead to. I don't think anybody does.""But Labour MP Frank Field, who backed Leave and said Mr Corbyn was once more Eurosceptic than him, told the BBC that being in a customs union or the single market would be a ""deceit"" and dismissed suggestions Tory rebels could join with Labour to defeat the government as ""fairy tales"" and they would win any vote by a large majority.Mr Corbyn was an opponent of the EU when he was a backbench Labour MP, as he explained in his speech.""I have long opposed the embedding of free market orthodoxy and the democratic deficit in the European Union, and that is why I campaigned to 'remain and reform' in the referendum campaign.""He said scepticism was ""healthy"" but ""often the term 'Eurosceptic' in reality became synonymous with 'anti-European' and I am not anti-European at all, I want to see close and progressive cooperation with the whole of Europe after Brexit"".He said this ""new relationship"" he wanted to negotiate with the EU would ensure Labour could deliver on its plans to nationalise public utilities, invest in industry and curb the outsourcing of public services.He said EU competition rules would, for example, not allow Labour to nationalise the Royal Mail, water and the railways and he would seek exemptions from them and rules restricting state aid of industry.Mr Corbyn's speech was welcomed by Britain's largest trade unions and the industry body the CBI, which said staying in a customs union would ""grow trade without accepting freedom of movement or payments to the EU"", although the group said it was sceptical about the Labour leader's nationalisation plans.Pro-European Labour MPs said he had not gone far enough, with backbencher Chris Leslie saying: ""The only sure and certain way to get the benefits of single market membership is to be a member of the single market and we should not pretend otherwise.""  But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was the ""first step in a complete Labour sell-out"" and the EU would push Mr Corbyn's party towards single market membership.Conservative rebel Stephen Hammond described Mr Corbyn's speech as ""vacuous - he had nothing new to say"". He said he would wait for Mrs May to state her position on customs arrangements after Brexit before deciding whether to vote against her.The DUP, the party Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, branded Mr Corbyn's speech ""cheap political opportunism"" and assured Mrs May they would ""be giving our full support to the government to oppose this Brexit wrecking policy which regardless of the promises made by Corbyn will result in the UK still being tied to regulations, directives and diktats from the EU.""Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable tweeted that Mr Corbyn's customs union stance was a ""small step to sanity"", but added: ""In #SingleMarket he is still following @theresa-may cake and eat it policy. Just wants red cherries rather than blue raisins."""
2018-02-26,Scots minimum alcohol price to be 50p,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43197384,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Scottish government has recommended that the minimum price for a unit of alcohol should be set at 50p.The minimum pricing scheme will come into force in May, after ministers won out in a lengthy legal battle.Legislation was approved at Holyrood in 2012, but only cleared legal challenges in the Supreme Court in November 2017.Health Secretary Shona Robison said a consultation had backed the planned 50p unit price, which will go before MSPs at Holyrood before it comes into force.Minimum pricing is designed to cut the intake of problem drinkers by raising the price of the strongest, cheapest alcohol, with the extra revenue going to retailers.Alcohol Focus Scotland had found that super-strength cider and own-brand spirits could be bought for as little as 18p per unit.A 50p minimum price was outlined in the original legislation, which was the first of its kind in the UK, and has now been endorsed via a public consultation.This would raise the price of the cheapest bottle of red wine (9.4 units of alcohol) to £4.69, a four-pack of 500ml cans of 4% lager (8 units) would cost at least £4 and a 70cl bottle of whisky (28 units of alcohol) could not be sold for less than £14.Normal strength cider (5% ABV) would cost at least £2.50 a litre but a super-strength version (7.5% ABV) would have to cost a minimum of £3.75 for a litre.The Scotch Whisky Association had pursued a lengthy legal challenge to the legislation, claiming that an excise duty or tax would be an equally effective way of cutting problem drinking.However judges at the Supreme Court in London rejected this, saying that minimum pricing was a ""proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim"" and would target ""the health hazards of cheap alcohol and the groups most affected in a way that an increase in excise or VAT does not"".Ms Robison said: ""I am grateful to everyone who took the time to respond to the consultation on our proposed minimum price per unit of alcohol and I am happy to confirm that we will be moving forward with our recommendation of 50 pence.""With alcohol on sale today in some places at just 16 pence per unit, we have to tackle the scourge of cheap, high-strength drink that causes so much damage to so many families. This move will save thousands of lives.""Opposition parties have raised some questions about aspects of the policy, with the Greens and Lib Dems calling for a 60p minimum price and Labour saying the cash raised should be ""clawed back"" by the state rather than retailers."
2018-02-26,Move to cap 'rip-off' energy bills,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43192583,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNew legislation to free people from ""rip off"" energy tariffs should be operating next winter, a move which would protect 11 million customers.The law will allow energy regulator Ofgem to limit how much companies can charge customers for their standard variable tariffs.The government is under pressure to ensure that the measure is ready for the next cold spell. Trade body Energy UK said it was vital the cap did not stifle competition.The government said the Domestic Gas and Electricity Bill, which is being introduced to Parliament on Monday, should be implemented by Ofgem ""as soon as possible so that customers get the protection they need by the end of this year"".Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee in the Commons, said: ""Energy consumers have been overcharged for too long and the government now needs to quickly ensure this legislation is passed in time to protect customers next winter.""The law will limit the cost of firm's standard default tariffs until 2020. Following that, the cap may be extended on an annual basis until 2023.One million households who get the Warm Home Discount saw an energy price cap introduced in February - an extension of the cap already in place for prepayment meter customers. This will also apply to another two million vulnerable households next winter.When customers' fixed-term deals end they usually automatically move to this tariff, which applies to 11 million households. Ofgem says the price difference between the average standard variable tariff default deal and the cheapest rate in the market was £308 at the last count in December.It is moving to introduce legislation to cap these variable tariffs, overseen by Ofgem. This will not take effect until the law is passed. The government wants it done by the end of the year at least.Some suppliers are moving towards abandoning variable tariffs. Ofgem has also changed the rules to allow suppliers to default customers on to another fixed deal. Customers are still likely to be better off by searching and switching themselves.Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""It's often older people or those on low incomes who are stuck on rip-off energy tariffs, so today we are introducing legislation to force energy companies to change their ways.""The move is an admission that encouraging consumers to regularly switch providers to pay less has not been as successful as hoped.About a third of households are charged a variable price for their energy at a default rate set by their energy company, because they have not chosen to shop around for a cheaper fixed-price deal.The Department for Business Energy and the Industrial Sector said that the energy market was not working and that domestic customers of the ""Big Six"" energy companies were paying on average £1.4bn a year more than they would in a truly competitive market.""We're going to give powers to Ofgem to make this energy market work for everybody by winter 2018, to set a maximum absolute cap [to be] paid by customers on standard variable and default tariffs, the tariffs that the majority of households are on and sometimes don't even know it,"" the Energy and Clean Growth Minister, Claire Perry, told the BBC's Today programme.The Business Department says the average annual savings between standard tariffs and fixed rate deals could be up to £300. The changes are separate from Ofgem's safeguard tariff, which is already helping some five million vulnerable customers pay lower prices.The key decision over what level the new cap will be set at will be made by Ofgem.Energy UK, which represents the major suppliers, said it was important that the price cap reflected costs - most of which were outside their control, such as distribution costs and the wholesale cost of energy. Lawrence Slade, chief executive of the industry body, said energy providers were concerned a cap would damage investment and competition.""The risk of unintended consequences around caps is serious. What we have to do is, working with Ofgem and the government, is make sure the cap has sufficient headroom to allow competition to continue,"" he told the BBC.Last week Centrica, which owns British Gas, said it was cutting around 4,000 jobs worldwide, over half of them in the UK. The firm said the prospect of an energy price cap was part of the reason for the lay-offs.British Gas,  E.On and Scottish Power have all made moves to abolish standard variable tariffs, although customers who do not opt for a fixed-price rate will still be moved onto a default tariff.Ms Perry said the legislation would still apply to companies that ""try to game the cap""."

Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones said he wanted further progress that went beyond ""warm words"".The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them.But the Welsh and Scottish government have objected to the current proposals saying they amount to a ""power grab"" which undermines devolution.Under the plans, powers in devolved areas like farming are set to return to Westminster rather than Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast.After a meeting of UK, Welsh and Scottish ministers in London on Thursday, all three governments said progress was being made but further discussions are needed to try to reach agreement.The UK government has said it intends to change the bill and has proposed that the vast majority of the 64 powers returning from the EU will now go to the devolved administrations.In a speech at the Airbus plant in Broughton, Flintshire, on Monday, Mr Lidington said that the new offer represents a ""significant step forward in these negotiations"".He said: ""This offer puts beyond doubt our commitment to a smooth and orderly departure from the European Union, in a way that doesn't just respect the devolution settlements, but strengthens and enhances them.""Mr Lidington also said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit and dismissed the idea of independence for nations, saying the UK works better in ""unity"".""By retaining UK frameworks where necessary we retain our ability not only to act in the national interest when we need to, but to do so with a unity of purpose,"" he said.Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested.""Four different sets of rules would only make it more difficult and more expensive for a cheesemaker in Monmouthshire to sell to customers in Bristol or for cattle farmers in Aberdeenshire to sell their beef in Berwick-upon-Tweed,"" he said.First Minister Carwyn Jones, currently visiting the USA, said: ""I welcome the commitment of the UK government to continue to work with us on their EU (Withdrawal) Bill.""However, as currently drafted, the Bill allows the UK government to take control of devolved policy areas, such as farming and fishing, once the UK has left the EU.""This is an unacceptable attack on devolution in both Wales and Scotland.""We now need further progress that goes beyond warm words and I hope the 'very big changes' promised in the speech equate to sensible amendments to the Bill which respect devolution."""

He is due to deliver a major speech on the issue.Rt Hon David Lidington MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and effectively Theresa May's deputy, will set out what EU Exit means for the four nations of the United Kingdom, and the Government's vision for the Union and for devolution after Britain leaves the EU.In the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Lidington wrote: ""The UK is at a crossroads in our history.""We face a choice that will define our future journey together as we leave the European Union next year.""We could choose to leave as a country split and an economy disjointed, struggling to make our way in a new world outside the EU.""Or we can come together as one United Kingdom, confidently seizing new global opportunities as we build a prosperous, secure nation fit for the future challenged we will chase.""The SNP says UK ministers need to show some leadership.SNP MSP Ash Denham, speaking on BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, said: ""I've seen the reports that they think the SNP is going to potentially damage some trade deals going forward.""First of all that's completely wrong.""Second of all that's a sign of a weak government that are trying to blow up a smoke screen because they are unable to come to the table with some serious proposals in order to satisfy the Scottish government.""Commenting on the newspaper remarks, Scotland's Brexit minister Michael Russell said: ""With these comments from the UK government, the cat is out of the bag - and it simply underlines the urgent need to fully protect the existing devolution settlement.""People in Scotland voted overwhelmingly for devolution and against Brexit. But the Tories are now trying to undermine what we voted for - the Scottish Parliament - to force through what we rejected -Brexit.""The current discussions between the Scottish and UK Governments centre only on powers which are already devolved. The Tories have now made it crystal clear they want to take control of some of these devolved powers as part of their plan for a disastrous hard Brexit outside the EU Single Market and Customs Union.           ""This raises some very troubling questions for issues such as food standards and environmental protection. And if, for example, a proposed future trade deal involved healthcare, could Scotland be forced down the same route as England and made to open up our health service to private providers?""Mr Russell said the Scottish government has made clear it is not opposed in principle to common frameworks where a case can be made, but these must be agreed on the basis of genuine mutual consent.Conservative MSP Miles Briggs told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: ""We'd like to see those powers come back to Holyrood to strengthen the Scottish Parliament.""Beyond that there will then be cross-border issues which we haven't got that agreement on yet.""But I think with compromise there is the opportunity to do that. I think both governments are looking towards where these powers are going to have a common sense approach is something we should all be working towards."""

2018-02-26,Landlords who say 'no DSS' flout the law,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/education-42979242,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe thousands of lettings agents and landlords around the country who reject housing benefit claimants could be flouting equality laws, due to a recent legal case.The widespread practice has led to ""no-go zones"" for those on lower incomes - especially in desirable residential areas.But single mother Rosie Keogh won compensation for sex discrimination from a lettings agency that refused to consider her as a tenant because she was on state benefit.The cleaner and former paralegal successfully argued that blanket bans on benefit claimants indirectly discriminated against women, especially single women.This is because they are proportionately more likely to be claiming housing benefit than single men, according to official figures.Rosie's attempt to rent a property in a smart area of Birmingham in May 2016 was blocked when the lettings agent found she would pay some of the rent via housing benefit.The agent told her it would not be proceeding with her application for a property in Kings Heath before it had looked into her individual circumstances or assessed how reliable a tenant she would be.She had been living in the same property for 11 years with the rent being paid in full every time.After a letter of complaint was dismissed by the agents, the mother of one issued a claim for discrimination in the county court.""I felt something had to be done to challenge it. I was motivated by anger at such inequitable practice,"" said Rosie.""It made me feel like a second-class citizen. ""You are being treated differently - and it's women and women with children who are bearing the brunt of this because they need to work part-time.""And Rosie is not alone. There are whole areas of towns and cities in England that have become virtual no-go zones for people on housing benefit because lettings agents and landlords are unwilling to deal with them.A survey of 1,137 private landlords for housing charity Shelter in 2017 found that 43% had an outright ban on letting to such claimants. A further 18% preferred not to let to them. And an investigation by the BBC last year found many landlords prefer to let to families with pets than those on benefits.Rosie was supported in her case by Shelter, whose legal officer Rose Arnall said: ""By applying a blanket policy they are actually preventing good tenants from accessing the private rented sector.""Women are more likely to be caring for children and therefore working part-time and are therefore more likely to top up their income by claiming housing benefit.""Because of the lack of available social housing, more than a fifth of those renting privately are relying on housing benefit either wholly or partly to cover their rent, according to 2017 figures.Eighteen months after Rosie first began her fightback, lettings agent Nicholas George admitted indirect discrimination on the grounds of her sex, settling out of court with £2,000 compensation.She also had help from the Bar Pro Bono Unit with the case who found a barrister willing to help for free.Robert Brown gave advice and drew up the consent order which was witnessed by a judge at Birmingham County Court.Although not setting a legally binding precedent, the case established that the practice could be considered indirect sexual discrimination.Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said private renting was so expensive that many people could not get by without housing benefit, even if they were working.""Our advisers repeatedly hear from desperate mothers battling to find someone willing to let to them, in spite of being able to pay the rent.""We are urging all landlords and letting agents to get rid of 'no DSS' policies, and treat people fairly on a case-by-case basis."" Chris Norris, head of policy at the National Landlords Association, agreed there was no place for discrimination on the basis of someone's gender.""Cases like this highlight the very worst of what a minority of renters have to put up with when looking to secure a home in the private rented sector.""He added: ""The number of landlords willing to rent to housing benefit tenants has fallen dramatically over the last few years because cuts to welfare and problems with the universal credit system are making it more and more difficult for anyone in receipt of housing support to pay their rent on time and sustain long-term tenancies.""Labour's housing spokesman John Healey said government cuts to housing benefit had stripped away the safety net for families and led to ""no-go zones"" for families on low and middle incomes.""These short-sighted decisions have made landlords more wary of tenants claiming housing benefit and so made discrimination more likely.""A government spokesman said: ""It's wrong to treat someone differently because they are claiming a benefit.""The majority of claimants are comfortable managing their money but we are increasing support to help people who need it to stay on top of their payments.""He added that from April, people in receipt of housing benefit would receive two weeks' rent when they moved on to universal credit and landlords could now apply to have the benefit paid directly to them if their tenants were more than two months in arrears.But one landlord, Tom Black, said his landlord insurance prohibited him from taking tenants that are on housing benefits when their tenancy starts.Another said: ""As a council accredited landlord who trains others to become accredited,‎ I can safely say that the ""no DSS"" is not down to landlord preference or discrimination... it's entirely down to (a.) mortgage terms and (b.) severe delays in the claimants HB claim, universal credit policy to pay claimants directly into their bank account.""We personally could fill our houses 10 times over if we could rent to DSS as our phones never stop ringing, day and night, whenever we advertise a vacant one.""I am a mother of 3 children, ages 3, 7 and 11. I have had to private rent for the last 8 years due to the lack of council properties available. I have moved 7 times within those 8 years and each time to a completely different area because of lack of estate agents and landlords who will except housing benefit. We have had to move due to landlords no longer wanting us after the benefit cuts, and also bad landlords who would not keep the house together. Due to be refused a tenancy over and over again so many times due to being on housing benefit, we have had to look further afield. We have moved from Southampton to Eastleigh to Gosport to Andover. My daughter who is aged 11 has been very affected by this after now being in her 8th school and this has effected her education and her mental health, due to constantly having to make new friends and losing many every time. This is all because there are so so many landlords who will not accept housing benefit even though we are great tenants and always pay our rent on time as it is our priority. This needs to come to a stop. We do not feel safe in any property. We have been faced with homelessness previously due to not finding anywhere and even when we Have, the estate agents feel they can charge hundreds of pounds more due to our circumstances which does not make any sense as we have a low income so we are forced to be homeless if we can't pay or find a suitable guarantor. These guarantors that they want have to be very specific and earning so much money but unfortunateley not everyone knows someone that is employed and earning so much money. My family and I have been trying to move house for over a year now. We currently rent privately and have been keeping up with our rent at this property for over 7 years. I search online every day for properties, from Cornwall, right up to the Scottish Borders. I am lucky if I find 1 property a month that will accept DSS and be in a suitable area for us to raise our children. Being so few of these properties, they are snapped up almost amediately. People on benefits are being viewed as a nuisance risk and are being pushed into inner city areas blighted by crime. The children are being punished because their parents can't work, or have a job with a low income. How can that be fair?Welcome to my world!! It is hardly news that pretty much all Lettings Agents have 'No DSS' on their advertisements. The other way they stop Housing Benefit recipients from renting are - 'HB accepted with a guarantor' (I don't know anyone who could do this for me) or, the absolute doozie 'HB considered, please ask' (this means, Housing Benefit considered if you can pay six months' rent up front, plus their fee and a deposit - if you had that much spare, you wouldn't be claiming Housing Benefit!). I have battled to house my family, as, even when I was well enough to work, I needed a HB top-up, as I'm a full-time carer for 2 of my adult children, I can only work part-time. If I'm honest, I have lied to agents in the past, just to get a roof over our heads.I am a wheelchair user and any property I phone up and tell then this and I'm on housing benefits it's a straight no not even considered. I arranged a viewing at a house in risinghurst, oxford and got as far as signing documents. Landlord was happy to be housing a mother and two children (aswel as the family dog) but as soon as I mentioned housing benefits paying a small fraction of the cost, the entire agreement shut down and the agent became frustrated that I hadn't told her prior to viewing. It was embarrassing and upsetting. We are stuck in a privately rented property that is much too small for us because nobody will give us the benefit of the doubt. If we are asked to vacate this property I have no faith that we will be able to find anywhere else to live. Despite that we have paid our current landlord every month for 11 years, and that  upon graduation, I will be earning a more than reasonable wage and the benefits will only be temporary. It's degrading and frustrating. The sooner this is (rightly) viewed as discrimination, the better.I was denied even inquiring about looking at private flats in London simply due to claiming housing benefit. Surprisingly, my wage is above the national average just over 29,000, but in London and having a child, this still entitled me and my partner to around £440 per month housing benefit.  I tried to explain to the letting agent I am in full time, contracted employment, and anyone with a child earning under £35,000 per annum will be receiving housing benefit of some sort in London and they said it didn't matter. This isn't just blocking women from renting it's blocking entire families. My daughter was a blame-free tenant for 10 years in one property from which she was given notice for no reason.  Despite numerous letters of appeal and requests for conciliatory meetings, the landlords did not answer any of her correspondence.  She could not even get them to give her a written reference.  She sought replacement accommodation for herself (a lone parent) and her two little children aged 6 and 3, for six months before finding a landlord/ estate agent who would take her (on housing benefit) with my husband as guarantor.  The whole experience has not only caused her great stress and anxiety and has led to an exacerbation of her chronic depression, but has also affected her six-year old who has become angry and withdrawn and fearful they will be evicted again from their new home.  The stipulation ""no HB, Children or Pets"" was appended to most of the rental properties on offer.  It reminded me of London in the 50s and 60s.  ""No blacks or Irish.""I am disabled and I have to be on housing benefits. It is virtually impossible to find a place that accepts housing benefits and those that do accept it require a guarantor with unacceptable requirements.  I was made homeless and spent time sleeping rough when my landlord of my previous place decided to renovate and increase rent and price me out of the place and so he asked me to leave.  I had paid rent in full for the previous 8 years with him no problem and have never had a problem.  I am now stuck in a council home with no chance of ever moving or improving the place where I live.  The equality act should account for disabled people on housing benefits being discriminated against.  Since I could not go to a letting agent I tried to rent a place from a landlord personally advertising and renting their property, going that route I was also told on a number of occasion that their buy-to-let mortgages stated they could not let out to people on housing benefits.  This shows the banks are also discriminating against disabled and people on housing benefit.  Is it just because of a few rotten apples spoiling the bunch for the rest of us?  Where and when does this discrimination originate from?  The 70's or 80's?  The fact letting agents call it DSS makes me think so, it hasn't been called that for decades.  What are the statistic for rent arrears with people on housing benefit versus those on jobs?  What about those with disabilities? With JSA type benefits allowing housing benefits they can be stopped and rent arrears can accrue if you miss an appointment, a horrible position to have that held over your head, however, if disabilities grant housing benefit, your disability is not going to suddenly disappear and your housing benefit with it.  It is blatant discrimination against people with disabilities and those on housing benefit, it disgusts me. Renting decisions should be based on your previous history and if it is good you should not automatically be excluded or need a guarantor.Housing Benefit is just that. For Housing. Landlords would accept benefit tenants if rent was paid directly to Landlords with a guarantee that it would start at the beginning of a tenancy and be guaranteed to continue. The reality is that once a tenant is is a property, the assessments can take many weeks. The slightest error by a tenant means the application has to start again, meaning 6-8 weeks delay. The Council isn't concerned as the applicant isn't homeless. This is the reality, while of course a Landlord still has to pay his mortgage. I just get tired of the ill informed comments by Shelter. How many properties to HB tenants do they rent out? How many properties do they rent to anyone? Millions in income. So why don't they put their income to good use, and help solve the problem. Yes, there are bad Landlords, but the vast majority are good, and wish for good, long term tenants. Conversely, there are good HB tenants, but equally others who are not.."

And in the last few days his shadow team had given the game away in terms of the party's firmer backing for this idea.The notion of a customs union will be welcomed by businesses who want to minimise the disruption of Brexit - and the idea would go some way towards solving the problem of the Irish border, which as we've discussed many times is one of the tensions in the government's position.This speech, and this policy move, is no Remainiac dream. Jeremy Corbyn has not suddenly become a convert to staying in the single market, nor for a second referendum.The Labour leader has stopped short of where many of his MPs would like him to go, and are already calling for publicly - full backing for the UK to stay in the single market.And it is also the case that it is extremely likely that the European Union would say a hypothetical 'no' to what he is asking for: a say in future trade deals alongside this new proposed customs arrangement.Mr Corbyn also said in his speech that a Labour government would ""not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others"".So, if the EU says we can't have a say in a customs union, and Mr Corbyn says he wouldn't join a union if the UK wasn't given a say, what happens then? Nothing about what outwardly seems a softer Brexit is guaranteed. If the promise is an impossible one, is it really a promise at all?What is, however, also true is that as the government and Parliament wrangles over Brexit, this new position on customs does give Labour a clear dividing line with the Tories - yes, one of those old chestnuts.That might rile Brexit-backing Labour voters, and worries some MPs.And it does make a potential defeat in the Commons when the Trade and Customs Bill eventually gets there more likely.Yet there is also nothing certain about that. Yes, there is probably a majority in Parliament for staying in a customs union. But for the government to be beaten on that, or forced to move towards Labour's new position, depends on the will of Tory Remainer rebels being ready to take a course of action that could damage the government.Jeremy Corbyn can today pave the way, but he can't be sure they will take the bait."

Almost 300 years since his death, his past is set to be formally acknowledged by the city for the first time. But does this go far enough? Colston made his fortune through human suffering. Between 1672 and 1689, his 40 slave ships transported about 100,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. However, in the city he called home, his memory has been honoured for centuries. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings.  His statue, which stands on Colston Avenue in the city centre, makes no mention of his notorious past. But this could be about to change.The city council is proposing to put a plaque on the statue which will recognise and acknowledge the people Colston and others in the city enslaved. It's a move that has been a long time coming, says Ros Martin, one of the driving forces behind the Countering Colston campaign group.""The plaque is good but we need it to be part of an ongoing examination of historical narrative and a change of attitudes and culture.""What we want goes beyond tokenism - we want institutions and organisations in the city to examine their history and acknowledge their individual roles in the slave trade and beyond.""The drive to reconsider Bristol's attitude to Colston has long-been gathering momentum.For years Massive Attack refused to play at hometown venue Colston Hall, which last year agreed to drop the slave trader's name.Not before time, says Miles Chambers, the city's poet laureate.""Some people don't get that black people still feel the full impact of slavery today.""We can look at the descendants of the slaves and economically they are still worse off; psychologically they are still worse off; mentally they still feel collectively as inferior; more African-Caribbean males are disproportionately in prison and in the judicial system; they do worse at schools; economically are paid less and are working less.""The pattern continues and even though many people say slavery is over, because of those legacies we still feel enslaved.""A name change or statue move is not going to rectify racism or eradicate the slave mentality that still exists, but it will help to say to black people: 'You are equal to us, you are British, you are valuable and you mean as much to us as any other citizen'.""In 1680 Colston became a member of the Royal African Company which at the time had a monopoly on the slave trade. By 1689 he had risen to become its deputy governor.Slaves bought in West Africa were branded with the company initials RAC, then herded on to ships and plunged into a nightmarish voyage.Closely shackled together, hundreds of enslaved people lay in their own filth; disease, suicide and murder claimed between 10 and 20 per cent of them during the six to eight week voyage to the Americas. Human suffering on this scale made Colston rich and a grateful Bristol honoured his benevolence; naming dozens of buildings, institutions, charities, schools, sports clubs, pubs, societies and roads after him. His charity is commemorated and celebrated during processions and church services. School children have paid homage to him at services. His statue stands in the city centre, inscribed as a ""memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"". For hundreds of years, he has been unquestionably venerated.""Colston may have helped more people than he abused but the people he abused and their descendants say this is unacceptable and although they are a minority, something needs to be done about it,"" says Mr Chambers.""We are still seeing the effects of slavery in this city, there is still money from slavery in this city and so we can't ignore it.""There have been questions about Colston and his profile in Bristol since the 1920s but they remained largely ignored until 1999 when Prof Madge Dresser, at the University of West England, spoke about Colston and his involvement in the slave trade.The next morning, ""Slave Trader"" was scrawled across his statue.The graffiti was scrubbed off and the city went back to turning a blind eye until two years ago, when Countering Colston ignited the debate once again. It has staged protests outside many events linked to Colston and called for the city to remember, among other things, the ""full, true history of transatlantic slavery, colonialism and exploitation"".""When you come to Bristol you go around the streets and, for anyone outside coming in, they must think 'Who is this man?' and 'Why are so many buildings, roads and schools named after him?',"" says Ms Martin.""I think it's very disingenuous, very disrespecting of the memory of African ancestors who contributed to the wealth of the city through enslaved labour. They suffered and there is not enough recognition in any way. ""[Countering Colston] would like to see permanent public art works as a memorial to the victims of the city's human trafficking into enslavement. ""I would like all those institutions that played a role in this business of transatlantic inhumanity to provide public exhibitions of their involvement and a monument to those who suffered in their institution.""Countering Colston's work is beginning to make its mark. After Colston Hall announced it was severing any connection with the slave trader, others swiftly followed.For the first time in centuries, a controversial church service in his name was dropped last year; the custodians of St Stephen's citing a ""growing concern"" about a man who made his money from buying and selling people. However, for some the campaign is simply going too far.""We all knew what he'd done but it wasn't spoken about,"" says Jane Ghosh, a former head girl of Colston Girls school. Founded in 1891 with an endowment left in his will, the school has steadfastly refused to drop his name. During her school days, Ms Ghosh took part in many Charter Day ceremonies to commemorate the school's founder. As head girl, she joined the procession through the city to St Stephen's church where she placed a wreath on his tomb, while Colston buns - created by and named after the merchant -  were handed out during the service.""I'm not an apologist [for slavery] but I am a realist,"" she continues.""So many families, so many buildings in Bristol are connected to the slave trade and one of the reasons I get a bit cross is because I think, 'Why are we picking on Colston?'""So many people were a mixture of good and bad - as we all are - and he seems to be singled out and I don't know why.""Between 1698 and 1807 just over 2,100 Bristol ships set sail on slaving voyages with many of the earliest voyages funded by ordinary people who provided cash or goods to be bartered for captured slaves.That Colston's name has not disappeared with time is testament to his membership of an influential and selective group of Bristol businessmen. The Society of Merchant Venturers helped set up and run many of the institutions and charities that still bear his name.Former museum curator and society member Francis Greenacre says the achievements of a man who did so much for charity have now been overshadowed by the debate about his name.""His status was extraordinary... the extent of his charity was vast in Bristol and enormous in London, as it was throughout the country."" Colston was one of many merchants who used profits from the slave trade to build luxurious mansions in Bristol.His wealth also founded schools and almshouses for the poor and he entrusted the society to carry on his work.Today, the Merchant Venturers run nine schools in Bristol, are involved in social enterprise, charities looking after the elderly, scholarships and trusts. However, the society is also behind many of the most controversial ceremonies, including a Silent Toast to Colston during its annual dinner.Campaigners accuse the society of continuing to ""celebrate a slave trader"". Mr Greenacre says the society is commemorating Colston's charity work, rather than his slaving past.""That word [celebrate] comes from Countering Colston - it is in no sense what is being done,"" he says.""We are not celebrating the slave trade; that is a perception which is in effect deeply offensive.""However, he acknowledges that times have changed and society must change as well, referring to the council's decision to acknowledge Colston's past.""Someone walking past his statue, which makes no reference to the slave trade; if they are a descendant of enslaved Africans they may feel genuinely offended; indeed some feel not just hurt but real anguish and that ought to be addressed."" For some, the amendment to Colston's statue is not enough.""I would really like it if the statue was put in the museum,"" says Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley, a presenter for community station Ujima Radio, which focuses on Bristol's African-Caribbean population.""People can still see that this is a man who did a lot for Bristol, but we should put [a statue] in the city centre of a black Bristolian who has changed Bristol and done something good for Bristol.""Others think saving Colston's legacy is not even as simple as moving a statue or changing the name of buildings, roads and schools. When he heard the concert venue would be dropping the name, history graduate Max Barton set up a petition against the move which attracted 5,000 signatures.He said it was ""time to educate and not eliminate"" people about the slave trader and his history.""White, working-class Bristolians have grown up with Colston as a kind of father of Bristol,"" he says.""They see him as a figurehead, they see him as this person who was a great charitable philanthropist - wiping out that history would alienate this group.""Countering Colston has a list of places associated with Colston on their website - a hit list as far as I'm concerned... they want to eliminate him from history and that will alienate people.""Bristol is not alone in trying to come to terms with its past. From Oxford to Charlottesville, from Sydney to Cape Town, cities are facing the same question - how do you remember history without celebrating brutality?Historian Dr Edson Burton is reluctant to see Colston's name disappear but believes Bristol is similar to many cities in being ""built on a romanticised myth"". He says now we are in a position to question ""the great figures that we have venerated in the past"", we should not be surprised to ""find that they are not up to the mark for our modern standards"".""I see that there are a number of institutions willing to look their history in the eye and acknowledge that there is a question about the legacy and foundation on which they were built. ""I think that is a monumental step - my concern is that it not sufficient enough.""He is one of many in the city searching for a solution. At the vanguard of change, in more ways than one, is Colston Primary School, which announced last year it would be changing its name.Chair of governors Kate Swainson Price said the decision was not about pandering to political correctness. ""For me, the decision to change our school name is about a recontextualisation of history rather than eradication, obliteration or whitewashing.""It's making history, not erasing history. Facts don't change but attitudes and values do, as do societies.""The school is now at the centre of plans to design the new plaque on Colston's statue, which will recognise and acknowledge the people he and others in the city enslaved.The children will be joining Countering Colston members, Prof Dresser and the city council to help put Colston's legacy into context.Ms Swainson Price said it was ""amazing and appropriate"" for the children to ""to help review and redress the balance about how we remember and acknowledge Bristol's historical figures"" and ""importantly, the slaves themselves"".The man in charge of the project, the council's historic environment officer Pete Insole, said the people who were exploited by Colston are ""invisible"" in Bristol.He is helping to co-ordinate events during the summer about the city's links to the slave trade, which will culminate in the unveiling of the plaque. ""Slave traders are the most commemorated people in the city; we can't change the past but we can change the present and the future,"" he added.But for Ms Martin this is only the beginning: ""We have created debate... It's not just Bristol, it's a global narrative, it's about colonisation and decolonisation. ""Across Europe and across America the debate is very alive. We are questioning people and we are challenging society.""You are only here for a short time on Earth and I like to think we are bequeathing something better than we have inherited."" "

But the main focus was on the UK's future economic relationship with the European Union. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been looking at a few key quotes from the speech.This was the key passage of Jeremy Corbyn's speech - putting clear water between Labour and the government. He wants to stay in a customs union to avoid the imposition of tariffs on goods traded within Europe, and to help solve the Brexit conundrum at the Irish border. As a member of the EU, the UK is currently in the customs union, which means that all countries impose a common external tariff - in effect the same tax - on goods being brought in from elsewhere in the world. Once those goods have crossed the external border, there are no further tariffs to move them around inside the customs union. Mr Corbyn wants to replicate most of that in a new customs union, which would certainly help companies who rely on moving goods across EU borders several times in their manufacturing process. But it wouldn't entirely solve the problem in Ireland, because some of the border issues - such as food safety or animal welfare - involve regulations that are nothing to do with the customs relationship.  Here Mr Corbyn addresses the government's primary reason for opposing the formation of a new customs union: that it would stop the UK doing trade deals around the world. He says he wants to ensure that the UK will be able to negotiate new trade deals ""in the national interest"".Although he is not explicit about what this involves in practice, it appears to mean that Labour wants the UK to be involved in negotiating those trade deals alongside the EU. He is not suggesting that the UK would be an entirely separate entity in international trade.Membership of a customs union constrains your ability to sign your own trade deals, because you can't alter external tariffs. But you can negotiate on services, or on harmonising regulations with other countries. Mr Corbyn argues that this is a compromise worth making, and it is another significant departure from government policy. The Conservatives accuse him of wanting to have his cake and eat it - a familiar theme. This is Mr Corbyn's political pitch, trying to peel enough Tory MPs away from the government to be able to defeat it in Parliament on the question of a customs union. He is trying to position Labour in the middle ground - supporting what appears to be a softer version of Brexit rather than what he would see as a hard ideological one. Of course anything Labour proposes, just like anything the government has proposed, does not have to win the approval of Parliament alone. It would also have to be negotiated with the rest of the EU, which remains suspicious of any UK effort to cherry-pick the best bits.  Mr Corbyn was very clear about this - attacking the government for starting with what he called rigid red lines on immigration and only afterwards working out what it meant for the economy. He says it is very clear that free movement of people from the EU would come to an end. There would, he says, be reasonable management of immigration, but the economy should always come first.This is a delicate balancing act. Without free movement of people, the UK will not get the same access to the single market that it has now. On the other hand, Labour can't ignore the ""take back control"" message entirely. But it is interesting to note that there was no mention at all in this speech of the future role of the European Court of Justice. It has always been clear that Jeremy Corbyn has never been a massive EU enthusiast. He says he campaigned for ""Remain with reform"" - which sounds suspiciously like David Cameron.But he was trying to appeal to both Remain and Leave voters in this speech, arguing that Brexit would lead neither to disaster nor to a land of milk and honey. Like the prime minister, he is trying to claim the Brexit middle ground. But, also like the prime minister, that doesn't mean he can sit on the fence, with little more than a year to go before Brexit is due to happen.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

A great reforming home secretary, a much-admired chancellor, a great European and somebody whose values and life that in many ways I have followed"".Roy Harris Jenkins was born in 1920 and was the product of the mining valleys of south Wales. A grammar school boy, who went on to win a first at Oxford.He was immersed in politics from an early age, following in his father's footsteps and becoming a Labour MP in 1948. As home secretary in the Labour government of the mid-1960s, Roy Jenkins oversaw some of the great social reforms of the 20th Century, including abortion rights, divorce, and the decriminalisation of homosexual acts. As a student, the young Vince Cable felt a great admiration for what Jenkins had achieved,""This was the era of Mary Whitehouse, an attempt to restore old fashioned values ... there was this enormous sort of mood, particularly amongst young people to sweep away all the rather old fashioned values which seemed to exist at that time ... and he, more than anybody else, lifted the barriers. ""It changed the face of the country, it modernised it, in a way that we would regard as perfectly normal today"".His experiences during World War II, first in the Royal Artillery and then as a code breaker at Bletchley Park, made him a passionate European. He would defy many in his party and campaign for membership in the 1975 referendum, leaving UK politics to become president of the European Commission two years later. What would Lord Jenkins make of Brexit Britain?""People of his generation were people who had fought in the war, who saw the rebuilding of Europe as something that was a political objective to end conflict in Europe ... I think he would be a very, very sad heartbroken man, if he saw what had happened today"".Lord Jenkins is often described as a ""bon viveur"" and it is in his celebrated love of the ""good life"" that Sir Vince sees the greatest difference in their characters,""My lifestyle is a little bit different, I'm probably a bit more puritanical, a bit more frugal. He liked the big long lunch, which became, I think, rather celebrated. A great lover of high class wines - I never really got into that.""But he did greatly respect Lord Jenkins's approach to politics and his relationships across the political divide, including leading Conservative politicians and well-known ""lefties"" like Tony Benn.""I did respect that in him, he had a good relationships right across the spectrum. Those were days when MPs used to write each other private letters of congratulation and condolence, and there was a kind of civilised environment.""Returning from Europe some years later, Roy Jenkins felt a growing alienation from the Labour Party as it swung to the left under the leadership of Michael Foot.In 1981, he and the other prominent ""moderates"" known as the Gang of Four would leave to set up the Social Democratic Party. A certain Vince Cable was among the Labour converts, ""What was most difficult, I think, for him and also for many of us was the break with many of the other so-called ""moderates"" in the Labour Party. ""One of his closest associates, Anthony Crosland, who had actually been his lover when they were at university together, and Roy Hattersley and people of that kind ... it was bitter for many years.""The SDP would later merge with the Liberals, to form the Liberal Democrats, and while many in the Labour movement believed Lord Jenkins had betrayed his party and his roots, Sir Vince thinks, on balance, it was a decision based on principle, for the national good.""Historians will argue for many, many years as to whether the breakaway was justified. I think, actually, the Labour Party modernisation which started under Neil Kinnock through John Smith to Tony Blair probably wouldn't have happened, if it hadn't been for the SDP breakaway.""And I think British politics is much the better for having had the Lib Dems, of which he was one of the parents.""In his later years as leader of the Liberal Democrats in the House of Lords, Roy Jenkins would advise Tony Blair as the New Labour project took form.As chancellor of Oxford University for more than 16 years, he would continue to write the acclaimed political biographies which he'd produced throughout his life. Married to wife Jennifer for nearly six decades, he died in 2003, at the age of 82. ""I think he was one of the great statesmen of the post war era,"" Sir Vince said.""You can read his legacy in his books. I think he fell short of what he ultimately wanted to achieve, he never became prime minister, his vision of the SDP Liberal Alliance never led to government as he had hoped, but he was a genuinely great figure in post-war British politics."""
2018-02-26,Cold War tales,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43168245,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMuch of the news in the UK this week has been driven by allegations by a former Czechoslovak spy that the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was a paid informer for the country's communist era secret police, the StB.Mr Corbyn emphatically denies the claims. Indeed all the evidence suggests he was never anything more than a person of interest to the StB. But as Rob Cameron reports from Prague, while the Cold War is over, a few sheaves of yellowing paper still have the power to throw lives into turmoil.As I sat at my computer, poring over secret police files, I felt a sudden tug of nostalgia. The files were digital copies of reports written by StB officer Jan Sarkocy, sent to Britain in 1986 under diplomatic cover. When he met first Jeremy Corbyn, in November of that year, his business card read ""Jan Dymic, Third Secretary to the Czechoslovak Embassy in London"".They were fascinating documents, cryptic and - for me - strangely evocative. Especially the references to North London landmarks I knew well, such as Seven Sisters Road, where the Labour MP for Islington had an office. But my task was not to dredge up my own memories of Labour politics while the party was in opposition in the 1980s. Rather it was to examine the six documents in dossier number 12801/subsection 326, codename ""COB"", for traces of anything incriminating. And believe me, I couldn't find them. Nothing in Agent Dymic's descriptions of three meetings with the Labour MP - two in the House of Commons, one on Seven Sisters Road - suggest the StB ever regarded him as anything other than a potential source. A young leftist with good contacts in the peace movement. An internationalist with a Chilean wife who kept dogs and goldfish. The only document he appears to have passed on to Agent Dymic was a photocopy of an article in the Sunday People about a bungled MI5 raid on the East German Embassy. And each meticulous report ended with a little note of expenses incurred; parking, two pounds; underground ticket, one pound. Signed: Jan Dymic. For clarity I spent a morning with the woman who is now the custodian of millions of documents still marked ""TOP SECRET"": the Director of the Czech Security Services Archive. For research purposes these dossiers - once jealously guarded by the Communist-era secret police and intelligence services - are now freely available to anyone; all you have to do is ask for them. The director had also given me Dymic's own personnel file. But his Slovak was littered with arcane abbreviations and jargon, and I was having trouble understanding them. ""COB"" was Jeremy Corbyn's codename, that much was obvious. Nothing sinister in that, she told me; the StB used them for everyone, including people they were interested in cultivating.OK, but what were ""GREENHOUSE I"" and ""GREENHOUSE II"" - mentioned repeatedly in the files? The Czechoslovaks seemed obsessed with trying to penetrate these targets, and many of Dymic's approaches to British politicians - Jeremy Corbyn among them - were initiated with the aim of gaining access to them. ""GREENHOUSE…"" the director frowned, peering at the screen. ""I'm sorry...."" she admitted, after a few minutes. ""I've really got no idea.""Two days later, speeding down the motorway to Slovakia, I made a mental note to ask Agent Dymic - now just Jan Sarkocy - what this ""GREENHOUSE"" was. I had mixed feelings about this meeting, secured after many emails and texts. At home, the StB were the praetorian guard of Czechoslovak communism, responsible for hounding dissidents, torturing priests, and spying on a cowed population. Today, the epithet ""estebak"" - an StB officer - is still a term of abuse. They also had several high-profile successes abroad; recruiting two Labour MPs from the UK in the 1950s and 60s. Their rivals in military intelligence even recruited a Conservative one.After a huddle outside his house with Slovak reporters - where he made his explosive claims - Sarkocy had gone to ground, and was no longer talking. But finally, he relented, and so I now found myself outside his home in the village of Limbach, about half an hour north of Bratislava.A thick layer of snow lay on the ground as we waited for him to answer the door. Lines from John Le Carre novels filled my head. ""It is cold in Limbach at this time of the year,"" I said in an exaggerated East European accent, to ease the tension. My Czech colleague - there to film the interview - laughed.In the end Jan Sarkocy was garrulous and friendly, still regarding his brief tenure in London with great affection. Most of what he told me, about an array of people and institutions, was so libellous - not to mention confusing - that I cannot even begin to repeat it here. But oddly not even he could remember what GREENHOUSE I and GREENHOUSE II were.The answer finally came from a BBC colleague. ""I've made some calls,"" he wrote. ""The main effort of the StB abroad, as directed by their Russian masters, was to penetrate the UK's intelligence agencies. So GREENHOUSE I was probably Century House, the former headquarters of the SIS, more commonly known as MI6."" Ah. And GREENHOUSE II was, I suppose, the headquarters of MI5.The GREENHOUSE mystery solved, and the Corbyn frenzy dying down in London, I boarded a train back to Prague. As the 12:10 from Bratislava sped through the frozen fields, my head still spinning, I did what any journalist does at the end of a story: my expenses. Parking; two euros. Tram ticket: one. I suddenly had an image of Jan Sarkocy doing his in London 30 years ago.A different job. A different era. But some things, I suppose, never change."
2018-02-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-26,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180226180029/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-27,Fox warning of customs union 'sellout',https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43204460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAny form of customs union with the EU after Brexit would be a ""complete sellout"" for the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said.The UK would find itself in a ""worse position"" than it is now, he said, if it left the existing arrangement but negotiated a similar new one.Having to accept EU rules and limits on doing other deals would make the UK ""less attractive"", he said.But his former top official has criticised the government's strategy.Sir Martin Donnelly, who was permanent secretary in the Department for International Trade until last year, said any deals done after Brexit would not compensate for leaving the single market and the customs union.Giving up access to the EU market and its existing trade agreements was ""rather like rejecting a three course meal now in favour of the promise of a packet of crisps later"", he said.Sir Martin, who has previously warned about leaving the single market and has worked for the European Commission in the past, said that negotiating full access to the single market without accepting EU rules would require a ""fairy godmother specialised in trade law"".Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he did ""not agree for a moment"" with Sir Martin's verdict, because the ""real growth opportunities"" were outside the EU.Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a long-term customs union, as Labour has proposed, would lead to ""colony status for the UK"", which would not get a say in trade policy.And Mr Fox hit back at Sir Martin as he took questions after his speech, saying it was ""unsurprising that those who spend a lifetime working in the European Union see moving away from the European Union as being threatening"".He added: ""The UK Brexit process is, as we've all discovered, a little more complex than a packet of Walkers.""The government has said it wants a customs agreement with the EU - which is the UK's single largest trading partner accounting for 43% of exports - but one that does not stop it from doing free trade deals with other countries.Mr Fox, one of the most prominent Brexiteers in the cabinet, is the latest minister to set out his stall as part of the government's attempt to map out ""the road to Brexit"", which is due to happen in March 2019.  His speech came the day after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn set out his approach to Brexit, saying he backed the UK being in a ""new and comprehensive"" customs union with the EU.Mr Corbyn says a new customs union will help protect existing jobs and supply chains while giving the UK a say in future deals negotiated by the EU.But Mr Fox rejected this, saying the UK would have to cede ""considerable control"" of its trade policy to Brussels in any customs union.In his speech, at Bloomberg in London, Mr Fox said that changing economic and trade patterns meant the EU was a less significant partner than 15 years ago and the UK must have the freedom to exploit the ""opportunities of the future"", particularly in services and digital industries.""As rule takers, without any say in how the rules were made, we would be in a worse position than we are today,"" he said. ""It would be a complete sellout of Britain's national interests.""Citing Turkey's experience of being outside the EU but joined in a customs union with it, he  said that if the UK found itself unable to set its own rules in key sectors of the economy, this would ""remove the bulk of incentives"" for other countries to enter into comprehensive free trade agreements. ""The inevitable price of trying to negotiate with one arm tied behind our back is that we would become less attractive to potential trade partners and forfeit many of the opportunities that would otherwise be available.""Flexibility, he said, must be the basis of the UK's trade policy if it is to support the fledgling industries that will provide much of the employment and income of the future.""There is a growing awareness that a full-blown gold-plated free trade agreement may not be the only solution in a fast-changing global economy,"" he said.There is a ""global trade toolbox"" of different options, including ""multi-country alliances of the like-minded"", he said.""All of these options are available. But only to countries with independent trade policies.""Labour said it made more sense for the UK to be negotiating new trade deals alongside the EU, adding: ""Liam Fox is divorced from reality and isolated from British businesses and workers.""But Conservative MP Nigel Evans told BBC 2's Daily Politics: ""When you're doing trade deals between one country and another country, it's a lot easier than when you're doing it with somebody representing 28 countries.""Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic.""There will have to be a border"", he told the Commons Brexit committee, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people. He suggested a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland.""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said.The European Commission will publish the first draft of its proposed withdrawal treaty on Wednesday, which it wants both sides to agree to by the autumn to allow for an orderly departure."
2018-02-27,Sturgeon rejects offer in devolution row,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-43206967,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has rejected the UK government's latest proposal in a row over who should exercise certain powers after Brexit.Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the ""vast majority"" of returning EU powers will start in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.He said Westminster would only be involved where a ""pause"" was needed to draw up a UK-wide framework.But Ms Sturgeon said this would still restrict the devolved administrations.It amounts to a veto over how the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies can exercise their powers, she told the BBC.Ms Sturgeon said it was ""very likely"" the Scottish Parliament will not give consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill unless the UK government changes its mind.The move would not veto or block Brexit, but would make things extremely difficult politically for the prime minister. The two governments have been at loggerheads over how powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels, are distributed after the UK leaves the EU.Ms Sturgeon said she accepted that in some cases there would need to be common systems of regulation, but she insisted that they needed to be agreed between the UK government and the devolved administrations - and cannot be imposed by Westminster.She said: ""We are simply trying to protect the powers that the Scottish Parliament already has - things like agriculture, fishing, environmental policy, food standards, justice, health.""These are all currently responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament. At the moment we have to exercise those powers within the confines of European law.""But after Brexit, in terms of the devolution settlement, those powers should return to the Scottish Parliament and it should be up to us how we exercise them.""On Monday, Mr Lidington said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit, saying the UK works better in ""unity"".Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested.He added that the government had made a ""considerable offer"" to the devolved administrations.Let's be clear - the devolved administrations cannot veto Brexit, they cannot block, they cannot thwart.The talk of there being a requirement for consent from the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly is purely a convention, and hasn't got weight in law.Westminster is sovereign, and Westminster can legislate in this matter.If Westminster wants, it can say: ""If we can get this EU Withdrawal Bill through the House of Commons and through the House of Lords, then that's good enough for us and the rest of you can go swing."" But Westminster will not do that. Why? Because they want to proceed by consensus. The UK government is in enough trouble over Brexit without adding a fight with Holyrood into the mix as well.Ms Sturgeon said her government had always accepted there were issues where it makes sense to have common standards and regulations in all parts of the UK.But she said the UK government proposals meant Holyrood would have no say over any attempt by Westminster to lower environmental standards in Scotland - despite the powers being devolved.The first minister added: ""I will not sign up to something that effectively undermines the whole foundation on which devolution is built and no first minister, no Scottish government worth its salt, should do so.""She denied she was using the row as an excuse to push for independence, and insisted that the Scottish government was trying to reach agreement.But she said that, as things currently stand, it was ""very likely"" that both the Scottish and Welsh governments would ask their respective parliaments to not recommend approval of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Talks are continuing as the EU Withdrawal Bill makes its way through the House of Lords.The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them.The Scottish government is expected to introduce its own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood this week."
2018-02-27,Congestion charge 'shows way for NI border',https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43210156,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoris Johnson has likened the challenge of avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland to the boundaries between different boroughs of London.The foreign secretary said it was a ""very relevant comparison"" because money was ""invisibly"" taken from people travelling between Camden and Westminster when he was London mayor.London's congestion zone charge does not involve manual checks.Labour said his comments were ""typically facile and tactless"".The Irish opposition Fianna Fail party said it was ""extraordinary"" to suggest the two borders were the same, while the SDLP said: ""Trivialising the very serious concerns relating to Ireland displays a dangerous ignorance that must be challenged.""The future of the Irish border after Brexit has been a key sticking point in talks so far.The UK plans to leave the EU's customs union but wants to avoid border posts and physical checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Mr Johnson, a former London mayor, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there were ""all sorts of things you can do"" to achieve this.""We think that we can have very efficient facilitation systems to make sure that there's no need for a hard border, excessive checks at the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic,"" he said.""There's no border between Islington or Camden and Westminster... but when I was mayor of London we anaesthetically and invisibly took hundreds of millions of pounds from the accounts of people travelling between those two boroughs without any need for border checks whatever.""He added: ""It's a very relevant comparison because there's all sorts of scope for pre-booking, electronic checks, all sorts of things that you can do to obviate the need for a hard border to allow us to come out of the customs union, take back control of our trade policy and do trade deals.""Analysis by the BBC's Mark DevenportHow literally should we take the Foreign Secretary's analogy? The collection of the London congestion charge relies on a network of automatic number plate recognition cameras which identifies motorists moving around the city.However back in August last year, when the UK released a position paper on Northern Ireland after Brexit, government officials briefed journalists that a pledge to ""avoid any physical border infrastructure in either the United Kingdom or Ireland, for any purpose (including customs or agri-food checks)"" effectively ruled out plans for the installation of cameras near the border, or set back from it.Instead the clear suggestion was that any technological fix would be more likely to involve firms becoming ""authorised economic operators"" and filling out customs forms from the comfort of the desks in their office HQs.The BBC has asked for clarification of whether government policy has shifted on this point. But in the absence of a more detailed response we may note that Downing Street has told lobby correspondents that Mr Johnson ""was not offering a technical solution"" to the border issue.Instead, the prime minister's spokesman clarified, ""the foreign secretary was making a comparison to demonstrate our overall approach that the 110,000 people crossing the border will continue living their lives as before, travelling freely just as Londoners cross boroughs every day"". That defence is not likely to appease Mr Johnson's critics, but it seems fair to say he was trying to get out of a tight spot during a wide ranging Today programme interview, rather than seeking to unveil a wholly new approach to the one set out in last year's position paper.Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith dismissed the comments as ""ludicrous"".And he accused Mr Johnson of ""glibly dismissing the concerns of thousand of families and businesses who live and work along the border"", adding that his remark ""insults the intelligence of all who are worrying about how to resolve the border question after Brexit"".Irish MEP Mairead McGuinness, vice president of the European Parliament, also questioned the analogy. ""The UK is a different country than the Republic of Ireland ... and therefore the comparison doesn't quite fit,"" she told BBC2's Daily Politics.The foreign secretary's comments have also sparked a wave of reaction on Twitter:pic.twitter.com/nTj6btDHSsEnd of Twitter post  by @JoeyMillarA gable end mural in Camden vs one in Northern Ireland.

Just as tricky as Ireland. pic.twitter.com/kKcto6SX88End of Twitter post  by @AdamDKHarrisonBut former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith backed Mr Johnson.""What Boris was saying was there are various ways in which you can manage things, like money transfers, checks on cars, checks on lorries - the technology now exists and is being used and is being developed around the world,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.And DUP MP Sammy Wilson said a virtual border already exists.""There's a different tax regime in Northern Ireland than the Irish Republic - VAT, excise duty is different - yet billions of pounds worth of goods cross that border, taxes are paid and not a lorry is stopped to check the goods because through virtual methods, through IT, through electronic invoicing, those taxes are collected by both the Irish government and the British government,"" he said.The first draft of a legally-binding agreement between the UK and the EU, due to be published on Wednesday, is expected to address the issue of Northern Ireland.The Dublin government says the option of Northern Ireland staying in full regulatory alignment with the European Union after Brexit should be included as a ""backstop"" - but this is opposed by some Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party.Meanwhile former World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy argued that whatever Brexit option was chosen ""will necessitate a border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic, because checks will have to be carried out on goods and people.Instead he suggested to the Commons Brexit committee a ""Macau option"" for Northern Ireland.""You should think about giving to Northern Ireland the same autonomous trade capacity that China has given to Macau, which doesn't mean that Macau doesn't belong to China,"" he said."
2018-02-27,Toby Young vetting process criticised,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43209695,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowToby Young's reputation as a ""controversialist"" should have prompted greater scrutiny into his past before he was appointed to England's new university regulator, a probe has said.Mr Young quit within days over some past ""politically incorrect"" remarks.A report by the commissioner for public appointments criticised the Department for Education for failing to delve back far enough into his Twitter account.Labour said it showed the Tories were failing universities and students.The columnist was among a group of business executives appointed to the board of the Office for Students (OfS) last month to help lead the government's drive to apply market forces to higher education.The report reveals that the then higher education minister Jo Johnson had asked officials to tell Mr Young about the vacancy, but added that after being alerted to the role Mr Young had ""applied in the same way as other candidates"".The report says that Mr Young was then recommended for the job after a ""very good"" interview, although the then Education Secretary Justine Greening ""questioned the proposed choice of Mr Young, particularly in terms of time commitment"".Commissioner Peter Riddell's report said there was ""clear disparity"" in the amount of checks made between different candidates, revealed political interference in decision-making processes and ""serious shortcomings in terms of fairness and transparency"" in respect of one of the appointments.Ministers were forced to defend his appointment in the House of Commons following criticism from MPs, including prominent Tories, and a petition calling for him to be sacked gathered more than 220,000 signatures.Students and academics also took to Twitter to call for Mr Young's removal, highlighting disparaging and crude remarks he has made about women's breasts in social media posts and a 1998 article for Gear magazine on ""being a lesbian for the night"".The writer-turned-free school pioneer quit the OfS last month and apologised ""unreservedly"" for a string of controversial comments he had made online in recent years.According to the report, the Department for Education admitted it had not trawled back far enough into his social media accounts and was unaware of the tweets by Mr Young - even though the social media accounts of the initially preferred candidate for the separate ""student experience"" role was ""extensively examined"".""Due diligence was inadequate and not conducted in respect of all candidates on an equal basis, compromising the principle of fairness,"" the report stated.It added: ""Mr Young's reputation as a controversialist, in itself hardly a secret, should have prompted further probing to examine whether what he had said and done might conflict with his public responsibilities and standards expected on the OfS board.""Second, the rapid disclosure of what were described as offensive tweets in the days after his appointment suggest that it was not that hard to find them - that not much delving was required.""Toby Young started out as a journalist founding the culture magazine Modern Review with Julie Burchill.Following the collapse of the magazine he was recruited to work on Vanity Fair in New York, an experience that inspired his book ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"".As a Spectator columnist, Mr Young made a number of controversial comments including a description of wheelchair ramps as part of ""ghastly"" inclusivity in schools.In 2011 he set up the West London Free School which placed importance on discipline, ambition and ""a competitive atmosphere"". He is director of the New Schools Network, the charity which people who want to open free schools are encouraged to use.The commissioner, Peter Riddell, also said that email records mention ""Number 10 Googlers"" bringing the social media history of one candidate to the attention of a minister.""Notably, no such exploration or research was made on other possible appointees, including Mr Young,"" he added.Answering an urgent question on the appointment in the Commons, Education Minister Sam Gyimah admitted the social media vetting of Mr Young ""wasn't as extensive as it could have been, given his 40,000 tweets or so"".Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner demanded an immediate end to all-male appointment panels - after the report noted that these were used twice for the OfS.The SNP's Alan Brown labelled the recruitment process a ""blasé crony appointment system"", while former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell branded the report ""absolutely damning, particularly in relation to the former universities' minister and his role in this appointment"".Labour's David Lammy commented: ""Toby Young believed in eugenics, he made terrible remarks about disabled people, he made awful remarks about women ... what confidence now should working class young people across this country have in the Office for Students if we have a government where the minister who did this cannot come to the despatch box, apologise or step down?""Mr Gyimah conceded there were ""issues here that are questionable"", but he also urged MPs to have a ""sense of perspective"" about some of the ""admirable and laudable"" work carried out by Mr Young, which was ""why he was considered to be a serious candidate for this job in the first place"".But the report also described how the decision to appoint one particular candidate to the board ""was heavily influenced, not by the panel, but by special advisers, notably from 10 Downing Street"".Email records revealed a ""desire"" among ministers and special advisers not to appoint someone with close links to student unions, such as the National Union of Students, it added. That led to the preferred candidate for the student experience role being rejected.In his findings, Mr Riddell concluded that the advisory panel did judge candidates on a fair, open and impartial basis, but said ""avoidable mistakes were made"".""My investigation uncovered a number of areas where important principles in the Governance Code were breached or compromised in the appointments to the board of the Office for Students,"" he said.""In my experience, this episode is unrepresentative of the hundreds of public appointments that take place each year, but it is important that lessons are learned - not least so that talented people from a wide range of backgrounds are willing to put themselves forward to serve on the boards of public bodies.""The Office for Students has been established to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus. It has powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards."
2018-02-27,Barnier: No open-ended Brexit transition,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43215279,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSignificant differences remain between the UK and EU over the length of any post-Brexit transition period, the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He suggested the UK wanted an ""open-ended"" arrangement while the EU wanted a ""short and time-limited"" period that would last no more than 21 months.He said he hoped the publication of a draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday would help address unresolved issues.The future of the Irish border could not be left ""pending"", he also said. The UK has made it clear that it wants a time-limited ""implementation"" period of about two years after the UK's exit on 29 March 2019 and that it sees this period as a ""bridge"" to its new partnership with the EU.It says the period should last as long as it takes to ""prepare and implement the new processes and new systems"", but will end on a ""fixed date"".In a briefing in Brussels, Mr Barnier said there would be ""no surprises"" in Wednesday's document which he said would set out the EU's position on transition and would translate political commitments agreed last December on Northern Ireland, citizens' rights after Brexit and financial issues into legally binding text.Mr Barnier insisted once again there could be ""no regulatory divergence"" from EU rules during the transition and the UK would have to accept the existing body of EU law as a whole.He also said differences remained over what rights EU citizens coming to the UK during the transition would have and the extent to which the UK would take part in EU-wide justice, foreign affairs and security arrangements. Restating the EU's position that the transition should end on 31 December 2020, he said there were suggestions the UK did not want to put a definite end date on it. ""There are significant points of disagreement with the UK as to what we understand as transition agreement, the duration of this, and conditions for such an agreement,"" he said. ""The UK would like to, it seems, keep this duration open, which is not possible... In the light of these disagreements, we have not achieved a transition yet.""He said he was prepared to begin talking to the UK on solutions to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland once his counterpart David Davis put forward ""concrete"" proposals.The UK has said it hopes to maintain the existing invisible border either by sealing a comprehensive new partnership with the EU or, failing that, through the use of technology.In the meantime, Mr Barnier said it was the EU's responsibility to include the ""backstop"" option of Northern Ireland maintaining full regulatory alignment with the Republic in areas of existing North-South co-operation if no other solutions could be made to work.While all three options would be mentioned in the 120-page document, he said it would be this one which would be ""operationalised"" into legally binding text.The Democratic Unionist Party, which Theresa May relies on for votes to support her minority government, has expressed concern on the EU's emphasis on this possible outcome, which could effectively see Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union while the rest of the UK leaves. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told the Irish Parliament on Tuesday that it could not be assumed the text would be agreed by the UK or all the Northern Ireland parties so we may face ""an interesting few weeks"".

It is an alternative to the EU Withdrawal Bill, focused on devolved matters, to be used in the event that MSPs do not give their consent to the Westminster legislation.The Scottish government says there was still scope for a deal to be agreed with Westminster, but has rejected the current offer from UK ministers.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said on Monday that he had made a ""considerable offer"" to the devolved administrations, involving ""significant"" changes to the legislation.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she ""will not sign up to something that effectively undermines the whole foundation on which devolution is built"".Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh announced that he does not believe it currently falls within Holyrood's remit, which may leave the legislation open to legal challenge if it is passed.He said the bill ""anticipates the impact of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union"", and as such ""assumes that the parliament can make provision now for the exercise of powers which it is possible the parliament will acquire in the future"".He said that as it stands, the bill ""would not be within the legislative competence of the parliament"".However, this was opposed by Lord Advocate James Wolffe, the government's top legal advisor, who will address MSPs on Wednesday.He said the bill had been ""carefully framed so that it does not do anything or enable anything to be done while the UK remains a member of the EU"", meaning it should not fall foul of EU law.He said: ""It is compatible with EU law to make provision, in the way that this bill does, for what is to happen when EU law no longer applies.""Mr Russell told MSPs that he would ""respectfully disagree"" with Mr Macintosh, saying the Lord Advocate was happy for it to go ahead.And he noted that a similar bill tabled at the Welsh parliament had the backing of Mr Macintosh's opposite number in Wales.He said: ""If the UK government drops its power grab then it may still be possible to reach agreement, in which case we would not need to proceed with the continuity bill.""But we are proposing this bill should be put through on an emergency timetable to ensure it becomes law in time to make the necessary preparations.""Mr Russell also said his preferred option would be to find a way of amending the Westminster legislation to the satisfaction of both governments, something welcomed by Scottish Secretary David Mundell.The MP said: ""We have made a considerable offer to the devolved administrations on amending the EU Withdrawal Bill, and look forward to further constructive talks.""Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said the bill was ""unwelcome and unnecessary"", saying that ""the SNP are inviting Holyrood to rush through illegal constitutional legislation for which there is no need, when the UK and Scottish government are within spitting distance of agreement"".Labour's Neil Findlay said the UK government's handling of Brexit had been ""shambolic"", saying his party would oppose ""attempts to undermine"" devolution.Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie welcomed the bill, saying it should proceed ""even if the UK government offers a last-minute compromise"".Lib Dem Tavish Scott said it was ""not satisfactory"" that there was no agreement over the legality of the bill, asking for ""further opportunities"" for MSPs to scrutinise the legal basis for the bill.The introduction of the continuity bill, which would deal with the sections of the EU Withdrawal Bill relating to devolved areas, is the latest stage of a long-running row between the UK and Scottish and Welsh governments over post-Brexit powers.Ministers are at loggerheads over how powers currently exercised in Brussels are divided up after the UK leaves the EU.All agree that certain powers will be incorporated into UK-wide frameworks, but there is dispute over who will have final oversight of this, with UK ministers arguing that they should have the final say in some cases to ""protect the essential interests of businesses and consumers in every part of the kingdom"".Mr Russell contends that this amounts to Westminster ""using Brexit to try to take control of devolved powers without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament""."

The choice is whether it is north-south or east-west.There is a sea in between (Northern Ireland and Great Britain) but I recognise this is politically extremely explosive.""He has previously said that leaving the EU with no deal would be extremely bad for both parties.The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has made clear if the Irish Sea became a de facto trade border it would withdraw its support for the Conservative government. Speaking on the Daily Politics Show DUP MP Sammy Wilson said that on the basis of what has been leaked or discussed so far, the withdrawal legal text would be ""unacceptable to the DUP & probably unacceptable to the British government"".The DUP's ten MPs are keeping Theresa May in power as part of a confidence and supply deal.

Yes ALL white people.""Because most of ya'll don't even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour.""Your entire existence is drenched in racism.""The comments were later deleted.L'Oreal said her comments were ""at odds"" with their values and it ended its partnership with her.The 29-year-old will work with Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities, Dawn Butler, who held an event at Parliament on Monday to announce the LGBT advisory panel.Other advisers include Linda Riley, publisher of a magazine for lesbian and bisexual women, and entrepreneur Anthony Watson.It's understood the group will advise Ms Butler rather than the Labour Party directly on LGBT issues.A spokesperson for Ms Butler said: ""Dawn is proud to stand with those challenging discrimination.

Three of the car occupants were later jailed for the attack.AMs gave their support on Tuesday to a new law for 999 staff.Labour MP Chris Bryant wants to double the maximum sentence for common assault on an emergency worker to a year.The Rhondda MP said there were 20 such assaults in Wales a day.AMs unanimously agreed on Tuesday that the Parliamentary legislation, which has been given support by the UK and Welsh governments, can apply to assaults on workers in the Welsh NHS and fire services.Det Sgt Dowler said any additional protection for 999 staff had to be welcomed, as he described the attack on him.He had stopped late at night after spotting a parked car with smoke coming from the wheels.But as he approached the vehicle, the driver ran off, and the officer chase him - ending up on the floor with the man.""Whilst I was holding onto the driver on the floor one of the female occupants of the car jumped on my back and started gouging my eye,"" he told the Good Morning Wales programme on BBC Radio Wales.""I realised at that point I was in serious trouble with a large number of people around me and I was by myself.""He managed to activate his emergency radio alarm but then the assailants threw his radio away.""I felt completely vulnerable, and completely alone at that point.""A further scuffle developed with another passenger, before he was hit.""We were sort of grappling for a short amount of time and at that point he punched me to the face and I fell to the floor in some sort of state of unconsciousness.""He said a judge described his facial injuries as some of the worst he had seen, when the three attackers were caught and went to court.The driver was given a six month sentence, while the other two attackers received two year jail terms.What is the planned law?The Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Bill has already jumped some major parliamentary hurdles after Chris Bryant won the ballot last June to bring forward his bid for a new law.Although AMs backed the legislation on Tuesday, it is MPs in Westminster that will make it law.The bill has had its introduction and crucial second reading in the House of Commons, and has been considered at the committee stage. It will now come back before MPs in April, before being considered by peers in the House of Lords. If it continues to win cross-party support, it stands a good chance of making it the statute book.The legislation calls for increasing the maximum prison term for the offence of common assault from six months to 12, if the victim is an emergency worker or assisting an emergency worker.If the offence is more serious than common assault - crimes causing serious physical injury - the fact the victim is an emergency worker will be classed as an aggravating factor when it comes to sentencing offenders. It could mean fewer suspended sentences in the future, and stiffer penalties from judges.Blood samples could also be taken from those suspected of assault, where there is a risk of spreading an infectious disease by their actions, such as spitting or biting a personPolice officers, custody officers, fire and rescue service workers or volunteers, search and rescue service workers or volunteers and anyone engaged in providing NHS health services are among those covered.""An attack on an emergency worker is, in a sense, an attack on all of us because they're simply trying to save other people's lives,"" Mr Bryant said.""I just think that we need to say loud and clear that if you attack an emergency worker, we will not put up with it.""The principles behind Mr Bryant's bill have been backed by UK government ministers, and their Welsh Conservative colleagues in the assembly supported the consent motion for the bill. Welsh health secretary Vaughan Gething said: ""It is shocking to hear continued reports of emergency workers being attacked both physically and verbally while simply doing their jobs, trying to keep us all safe and well. This bill is part of dealing with this.   ""We want emergency service workers in Wales to have the same protection as those in England and on the same timescales.""Under existing rules, AMs have to give consent to legislation from Parliament that applies to powers which are devolved to the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Government.In this case, the Welsh Government tabled the motion because the law affects the NHS and fire and rescue services, which are devolved."

He has been accused of breaching kit and advertising regulations.The four MPs condemned the FA's decision in a House of Commons early day motion.Mr Guardiola's charge was triggered when he wore the ribbon on his jacket pitchside.  He is allowed to wear it elsewhere.The Manchester City boss has insisted he will continue to wear the ribbon.""It's not about politicians, it's about democracy; it's about helping the people who didn't do absolutely anything,"" he said on Monday.Several pro-independence politicians have been imprisoned in Spain in connection with an independence referendum held in Catalonia last year.The sacked regional President Carles Puigdemont remains in self-imposed exile in Brussels.Plaid Cymru politicians have been vocal supporters of the Catalonian independence movement - senior AM Adam Price was in Barcelona when October's referendum took place.Jonathan Edwards, the MP Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said: ""Pep Guardiola must be applauded for taking a brave stance in support of the unjustly imprisoned Catalan leaders, who were democratically elected to lead their country.""The Spanish Government's actions, in imprisoning its political opponents, are out-of-step with the democratic principles expected of a European state and an ally of the UK.""The English Football Association's decision to charge the Manchester City manager for expressing his support for his country's elected leaders must be condemned. ""The UK government should be putting heavy pressure on its allies in Madrid to respect the will of the people of Catalonia and pursue a peaceful and democratic solution."""

It combines this data - purchased from firms that gather such information from digital footprints created by people online - with pyschographics in order to ""micro-target"" individuals.Cambridge Analytica gained notoriety for using these methods in Donald Trump's presidential campaign Some have raised concerns that methods used to market products and brands in the advertising industry have now been transferred to the political arena.Mr Nix said that the data analytics his firm used in the Trump campaign were also widely used in President Obama's election campaign and that Hillary Clinton also employed ""hundreds of data scientists"".""I  think people see our work as negative because the client is polarising,"" he told MPs.""This is about micro-targeting voters and the techniques have been used in advertising for decades. We have taken their best practices and replicated them for a political party.""""We match data with large quantitative research that asks audiences for their preferences, and collate it to micro-target people""""There is a misunderstanding of what we do. We use data and technology to engage with voters in a more informed and relevant way. That can only be good for politics and democracy.""He also denied that the firm had undertaken any work on the UK referendum.In a letter published shortly before the committee meeting, Mr Nix said: ""Cambridge Analytica had no involvement in the referendum, was not retained by any campaign, and did not provide any services (paid or unpaid) to any campaign.""MPs spent a large chunk of time questioning this denial.Ahead of working on Donald Trump's campaign, Cambridge Analytica also worked with Republican candidate Ted Cruz.One of the MPs asked whether the ""psychological profiling"" used in the Ted Cruz campaign - giving the example of playing on the fear of women being attacked in their own home in order to support his tough stance on gun ownership - was scaremongering because it used fear as a tool.""Presenting a fact underpinned by an emotion is not fearmongering,"" said Mr Nix.He denied that the firm had a political agenda, saying it avoided political campaigns in the UK and that all political work was undertaken ""for main political parties in free and fair democracies"".Mr Nix was grilled by MPs over how the firm created profiles of 240 million Americans, with particular interest in whether the firm used Facebook data.He denied that the firm used data from the social media giant, but said it did use the platform to conduct surveys.Exactly how Cambridge Analytica created detailed profiles of nearly 240 million Americans remains something of a mystery, but US professor David Carroll is trying to throw some light on it by reclaiming his personal data from the firm.He is able to do so because his data was processed in the UK and so is subject to tighter EU data laws.Privacy experts think that the case could set a precedent in explaining how marketing firms collect and use citizens' data."

The level of scrutiny that has taken place, in my experience, is unprecedented. We are pleased the structure has held up to that kind of scrutiny.""With the bill - which was debated for 85 hours in the Commons - having now moved on to the House of Lords, her team's work is far from over, but she believes it remains in good shape despite being subjected to a blizzard of proposed changes by MPs.""Given what it is doing and what it is achieving, I think it strikes a very good balance,"" she says. ""A week after the referendum, I kept reading things that said this bill, when it came forward, would be three clauses. It is fanciful it could be done in three clauses, but neither is it 300.""The 51 year-old solicitor, the first woman to hold the post of first parliamentary counsel, has a gimlet eye when it comes to making sure bills hold together and, in modern political parlance, are fit for purpose. After nearly three decades as a parliamentary drafter, she is an accomplished exponent of her art but still expresses a disarming measure of surprise as well as pride at her role operating ""at the heart of government"".""I was planning to be a High Street solicitor in some sleepy town in Scotland,"" she says.Bills were originally drafted by normal barristers, MPs themselves or members of the judiciary. William Pitt was the first person to appoint a dedicated parliamentary draftsman.Barrister Henry Thring was appointed to head the newly created Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury in 1869, a post he held for more than 30 years.The OPC was initially part of the Treasury, but was absorbed into the new Civil Service Department in 1969,  changing its name to simply the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.That was until she read an ""interesting"" job advert for a parliamentary drafter in the early 1990s and soon found herself among stimulating although rather different company to that she had been used to.""The culture of the office then was quite male and Oxbridge, which was not my background. I would probably have found that quite difficult if I hadn't always loved the work.""I think it is the sort of job that you either love or hate, probably - I think it's a bit Marmitey. People leave very quickly if they don't like it, but there are a lot of people who come and stay a long time.""She was one of those who stayed, in her early years helping to write the Maastricht bill for John Major's government before being caught up in the legislative whirlwind that marked New Labour's early years in office.""What they used to say was that every Labour government legislated more than a Tory government but that every government legislated more than the previous one, of that colour,"" she says.""I have no scientific evidence for that, but we were certainly producing a lot of legislation in the early 2000s.""This put a strain on the department's capacity to do its job as, for different reasons, did the retrenchment in the civil service that followed the coalition government's post-2010 austerity drive.That period of cuts has now come to an end. She has 48 lawyers at her disposal from a diverse range of backgrounds, working directly on writing government legislation, including six recruited in the past year.The ""very specialist"" nature of the role means there is no ready-made production line for talent as there may be elsewhere in Whitehall and there is a huge emphasis on taking on the right people and then nurturing them.""Because it takes so long to train someone, we have to be very conscious about the future of the office. You can't just turn on a tap or go out into the market and find someone who can draft legislation.""As part of the recruitment process, candidates are asked to dissect a spoof government bill to determine whether they have the combination of intellectual rigour, analytical powers and flair to do the job.""There are people who look at it and can spot a few typos and there are others who pull it to bits and explain why it does not work. We need people who can deconstruct but can also reconstruct. ""You do get people who are very good at critiquing other people's drafting but when faced with a blank piece of paper find it extremely difficult to find a way in to creating a structure to produce that.""The drafting process, she says, needs consistency, collaboration and the ability to ask searching questions of ministers and their advisers, who are sometimes ""very close to the policy and can't see the bigger picture"". While bills very rarely ""collapse"" because of internal contradictions, they often end up looking rather different from how they started out.""One of my colleagues used to describe it as 'You have crafted an elephant and think it is a pretty good elephant and you are half way through Parliament and they decide they want a crocodile.'""You have got bits of the elephant chopped off and some bits stuck on. At the end of the day, maybe it is a functioning crocodile but not as nice a crocodile as you would have created.""MPs and peers cannot lobby drafters directly on the wording of bills but can, of course, make their own linguistic changes. While ""heavily amended"" bills present a challenge what worries her more is lack of scrutiny. ""You don't want to assume that no-one in Parliament is saying anything relevant.""You have to be quite thick skinned. But 999 times out of 1,000, when someone says the bill is not well drafted, they really mean, 'I don't like the policy in the bill.'""With increasing public interest in the law-making process - the legislation.gov.uk website gets two million hits a year - there has been a deliberate effort to cut out unnecessary jargon and make bills more accessible. ""Most bills won't be as difficult to read as people think they are,"" she says. ""If you compare an act from now to one from the late-1980s, it is written far more in everyday English.""The ultimate test of legislation remains its basic legality, but as a handful of bills over the past 30 years have shown - the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, for example - it is equally damaging for legislation to be found wanting in the court of public opinion.""I sometimes think certain pieces of legislation get a bad name and there is no way back, whether it is based on fact or not,"" she says. ""There are periods in history - and it is not a comment on the Dangerous Dogs Act particularly - where you would look at the front page of a tabloid newspaper and realise what it was you might be legislating for in reaction to that. There certainly has been some of that.""The risk of kneejerk legislative responses to a personal tragedy or institutional failure will never disappear.The increasing tendency of ministers to trail proposals in Green and White Papers or publish legislation in draft form well beforehand makes the job easier and in Elizabeth Gardiner's words ""strengthens the product"". But there are occasions where this is not possible and the challenge her colleagues face - summarised as producing ""clear, coherent"" laws that fit neatly within the existing statute book - rises a notch or two. Brexit is a supreme example of this.While the EU Withdrawal Bill is an ""unprecedented intellectual task"", it may pale into comparison beside the litany of statutory instruments likely to be needed to prepare the UK for life outside the EU and which - unlike most typical secondary legislation - MPs have vowed to scrutinise in detail.Her office is playing a key role working with lawyers across Whitehall as part of a Statutory Instrument Hub, drawing up what could be as many as 900 pieces of individual legislation. ""The secondary legislation that is to be required for Brexit is obviously going to be a significant challenge. ""They all have to be drafted. We have taken on some of the drafting, which is unusual for us, but... we can add quite a bit of value by intervening in some things.""While the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is a relatively tranquil corner of Whitehall, there has been something of a quiet revolution going on in the past decade.Flexible working is the norm - helping to ensure a 50-50 gender balance among the team - drafting guidelines are now available for everyone to read online, amendments are tabled by the press of a button not hand delivered to Parliament, and the office - since 2015 - is run by a woman for the first time.The mother-of-two didn't have a ""burning ambition"" to take the helm but is not unaware of having added another chink in Whitehall's glass ceiling.""I am the 24th [first parliamentary counsel], and there are 23 pictures of men on the wall.""I am proud to have got the job, but I realise that it means quite a lot to other people that there is a woman in the role. ""I don't see myself as a role model, but I have to step into that role a bit because it is important to people in the organisation that there are women in senior positions."""
2018-02-27,Dividing line,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43197428,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo things can be true at the same time.It is true that Jeremy Corbyn has not dramatically shifted Labour's Brexit policy.For months the party has been saying that some form of customs union with the European Union after Brexit is a possibility.The party's tip toes towards this policy have been long anticipated. And in the last few days his shadow team had given the game away in terms of the party's firmer backing for this idea.The notion of a customs union will be welcomed by businesses who want to minimise the disruption of Brexit - and the idea would go some way towards solving the problem of the Irish border, which as we've discussed many times is one of the tensions in the government's position.This speech, and this policy move, is no Remainiac dream. Jeremy Corbyn has not suddenly become a convert to staying in the single market, nor for a second referendum.The Labour leader has stopped short of where many of his MPs would like him to go, and are already calling for publicly - full backing for the UK to stay in the single market.And it is also the case that it is extremely likely that the European Union would say a hypothetical 'no' to what he is asking for: a say in future trade deals alongside this new proposed customs arrangement.Mr Corbyn also said in his speech that a Labour government would ""not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others"".So, if the EU says we can't have a say in a customs union, and Mr Corbyn says he wouldn't join a union if the UK wasn't given a say, what happens then? Nothing about what outwardly seems a softer Brexit is guaranteed. If the promise is an impossible one, is it really a promise at all?What is, however, also true is that as the government and Parliament wrangles over Brexit, this new position on customs does give Labour a clear dividing line with the Tories - yes, one of those old chestnuts.That might rile Brexit-backing Labour voters, and worries some MPs.And it does make a potential defeat in the Commons when the Trade and Customs Bill eventually gets there more likely.Yet there is also nothing certain about that. Yes, there is probably a majority in Parliament for staying in a customs union. But for the government to be beaten on that, or forced to move towards Labour's new position, depends on the will of Tory Remainer rebels being ready to take a course of action that could damage the government.Jeremy Corbyn can today pave the way, but he can't be sure they will take the bait."
2018-02-27,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43212899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowForeign Secretary Boris Johnson told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the UK's trade with the EU had been declining rapidly in the last 10 years and that it had fallen to about 44%.An hour earlier, Sir Martin Donnelly, who was the most senior civil servant in the Department for International Trade, told the same programme: ""If we leave the Customs Union and the single market then we are taking away the equal access that we've got to 60% of our trade - nearly half directly with the EU and another 12% or so through EU preferential trade deals.""So, how do we reconcile these figures? Well, they're talking about different things.The figure for 44% of UK trade being with the EU was cited a lot during the EU Referendum - it's actually a 2015 figure just for exports of goods and services. The 2016 figure was 43%, worth about £241bn, and it has indeed fallen from about 54% in 2006. (The figures for UK exports to the EU are here - total UK exports are here.) It should also be noted that while the proportion of UK exports going to the EU has fallen over the last 10 years, the value of those exports has risen by about 14%.The figure that Sir Martin Donnelly used of ""nearly half"" of UK trade being directly with the EU refers to the figure for both exports and imports, which was 49% last year (see sheet C from ONS balance of payments). The other figure he used was that another 12% of total UK trade is with countries with which the EU has deals that free up trade, for example, by removing some tariffs. If you take the countries with which the EU has trade agreements in force you do indeed get to 12% of UK trade.When the UK leaves the EU it will lose those deals and will have to renegotiate them or trade under WTO rules.Boris Johnson also referred to the countries with which the UK has had the biggest growth in trade, in which he included 100% growth in the UK's trade with South Korea since 2010 (again, he is just referring to exports, which grew from just over £3bn in 2010 to just over £6bn in 2016).At least some of the credit for that must go to the EU's trade agreement with the country, which has been in effect since mid-2011.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Almost 300 years since his death, his past is set to be formally acknowledged by the city for the first time. But does this go far enough? Colston made his fortune through human suffering. Between 1672 and 1689, his 40 slave ships transported about 100,000 men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. However, in the city he called home, his memory has been honoured for centuries. On his death in 1721, he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristol's streets, memorials and buildings.  His statue, which stands on Colston Avenue in the city centre, makes no mention of his notorious past. But this could be about to change.The city council is proposing to put a plaque on the statue which will recognise and acknowledge the people Colston and others in the city enslaved. It's a move that has been a long time coming, says Ros Martin, one of the driving forces behind the Countering Colston campaign group.""The plaque is good but we need it to be part of an ongoing examination of historical narrative and a change of attitudes and culture.""What we want goes beyond tokenism - we want institutions and organisations in the city to examine their history and acknowledge their individual roles in the slave trade and beyond.""The drive to reconsider Bristol's attitude to Colston has long been gathering momentum.For years Massive Attack refused to play at hometown venue Colston Hall, which last year agreed to drop the slave trader's name.Not before time, says Miles Chambers, the city's poet laureate.""Some people don't get that black people still feel the full impact of slavery today.""We can look at the descendants of the slaves and economically they are still worse off; psychologically they are still worse off; mentally they still feel collectively as inferior; more African-Caribbean males are disproportionately in prison and in the judicial system; they do worse at schools; economically are paid less and are working less.""The pattern continues and even though many people say slavery is over, because of those legacies we still feel enslaved.""A name change or statue move is not going to rectify racism or eradicate the slave mentality that still exists, but it will help to say to black people: 'You are equal to us, you are British, you are valuable and you mean as much to us as any other citizen.'""In 1680 Colston became a member of the Royal African Company which at the time had a monopoly on the slave trade. By 1689 he had risen to become its deputy governor.Slaves bought in West Africa were branded with the company initials RAC, then herded on to ships and plunged into a nightmarish voyage.Closely shackled together, hundreds of enslaved people lay in their own filth; disease, suicide and murder claimed between 10 and 20 per cent of them during the six to eight week voyage to the Americas. Human suffering on this scale made Colston rich and a grateful Bristol honoured his benevolence; naming dozens of buildings, institutions, charities, schools, sports clubs, pubs, societies and roads after him. His charity is commemorated and celebrated during processions and church services. School children have paid homage to him at services. His statue stands in the city centre, inscribed as a ""memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city"". For hundreds of years, he has been unquestionably venerated.""Colston may have helped more people than he abused but the people he abused and their descendants say this is unacceptable and although they are a minority, something needs to be done about it,"" says Mr Chambers.""We are still seeing the effects of slavery in this city, there is still money from slavery in this city and so we can't ignore it.""There have been questions about Colston and his profile in Bristol since the 1920s but they remained largely ignored until 1999 when Prof Madge Dresser, at the University of West England, spoke about Colston and his involvement in the slave trade.The next morning, ""Slave Trader"" was scrawled across his statue.The graffiti was scrubbed off and the city went back to turning a blind eye until two years ago, when Countering Colston ignited the debate once again. It has staged protests outside many events linked to Colston and called for the city to remember, among other things, the ""full, true history of transatlantic slavery, colonialism and exploitation"".""When you come to Bristol you go around the streets and, for anyone outside coming in, they must think 'Who is this man?' and 'Why are so many buildings, roads and schools named after him?',"" says Ms Martin.""I think it's very disingenuous, very disrespecting of the memory of African ancestors who contributed to the wealth of the city through enslaved labour. They suffered and there is not enough recognition in any way. ""[Countering Colston] would like to see permanent public art works as a memorial to the victims of the city's human trafficking into enslavement. ""I would like all those institutions that played a role in this business of transatlantic inhumanity to provide public exhibitions of their involvement and a monument to those who suffered in their institution.""Countering Colston's work is beginning to make its mark. After Colston Hall announced it was severing any connection with the slave trader, others swiftly followed.For the first time in centuries, a controversial church service in his name was dropped last year; the custodians of St Stephen's citing a ""growing concern"" about a man who made his money from buying and selling people. However, for some the campaign is simply going too far.""We all knew what he'd done but it wasn't spoken about,"" says Jane Ghosh, a former head girl of Colston Girls school. Founded in 1891 with an endowment left in his will, the school has steadfastly refused to drop his name. During her school days, Ms Ghosh took part in many Charter Day ceremonies to commemorate the school's founder. As head girl, she joined the procession through the city to St Stephen's church where she placed a wreath on his tomb, while Colston buns - created by and named after the merchant -  were handed out during the service.""I'm not an apologist [for slavery] but I am a realist,"" she continues.""So many families, so many buildings in Bristol are connected to the slave trade and one of the reasons I get a bit cross is because I think, 'Why are we picking on Colston?'""So many people were a mixture of good and bad - as we all are - and he seems to be singled out and I don't know why.""Between 1698 and 1807 just over 2,100 Bristol ships set sail on slaving voyages with many of the earliest voyages funded by ordinary people who provided cash or goods to be bartered for captured slaves.That Colston's name has not disappeared with time is testament to his membership of an influential and selective group of Bristol businessmen. The Society of Merchant Venturers helped set up and run many of the institutions and charities that still bear his name.Former museum curator and society member Francis Greenacre says the achievements of a man who did so much for charity have now been overshadowed by the debate about his name.""His status was extraordinary... the extent of his charity was vast in Bristol and enormous in London, as it was throughout the country."" Colston was one of many merchants who used profits from the slave trade to build luxurious mansions in Bristol.His wealth also founded schools and almshouses for the poor and he entrusted the society to carry on his work.Today, the Merchant Venturers run nine schools in Bristol, are involved in social enterprise, charities looking after the elderly, scholarships and trusts. However, the society is also behind many of the most controversial ceremonies, including a Silent Toast to Colston during its annual dinner.Campaigners accuse the society of continuing to ""celebrate a slave trader"". Mr Greenacre says the society is commemorating Colston's charity work, rather than his slaving past.""That word [celebrate] comes from Countering Colston - it is in no sense what is being done,"" he says.""We are not celebrating the slave trade; that is a perception which is in effect deeply offensive.""However, he acknowledges that times have changed and society must change as well, referring to the council's decision to acknowledge Colston's past.""Someone walking past his statue, which makes no reference to the slave trade; if they are a descendant of enslaved Africans they may feel genuinely offended; indeed some feel not just hurt but real anguish and that ought to be addressed."" For some, the amendment to Colston's statue is not enough.""I would really like it if the statue was put in the museum,"" says Jasmine Ketibuah-Foley, a presenter for community station Ujima Radio, which focuses on Bristol's African-Caribbean population.""People can still see that this is a man who did a lot for Bristol, but we should put [a statue] in the city centre of a black Bristolian who has changed Bristol and done something good for Bristol.""Others think saving Colston's legacy is not even as simple as moving a statue or changing the name of buildings, roads and schools. When he heard the concert venue would be dropping the name, history graduate Max Barton set up a petition against the move which attracted 5,000 signatures.He said it was ""time to educate and not eliminate"" people about the slave trader and his history.""White, working-class Bristolians have grown up with Colston as a kind of father of Bristol,"" he says.""They see him as a figurehead, they see him as this person who was a great charitable philanthropist - wiping out that history would alienate this group.""Countering Colston has a list of places associated with Colston on their website - a hit list as far as I'm concerned... they want to eliminate him from history and that will alienate people.""Bristol is not alone in trying to come to terms with its past. From Oxford to Charlottesville, from Sydney to Cape Town, cities are facing the same question - how do you remember history without celebrating brutality?Historian Dr Edson Burton is reluctant to see Colston's name disappear but believes Bristol is similar to many cities in being ""built on a romanticised myth"". He says now we are in a position to question ""the great figures that we have venerated in the past"", we should not be surprised to ""find that they are not up to the mark for our modern standards"".""I see that there are a number of institutions willing to look their history in the eye and acknowledge that there is a question about the legacy and foundation on which they were built. ""I think that is a monumental step - my concern is that it is not sufficient enough.""He is one of many in the city searching for a solution. At the vanguard of change, in more ways than one, is Colston Primary School, which announced last year it would be changing its name.Chair of governors Kate Swainson Price said the decision was not about pandering to political correctness. ""For me, the decision to change our school name is about a recontextualisation of history rather than eradication, obliteration or whitewashing.""It's making history, not erasing history. Facts don't change but attitudes and values do, as do societies.""The school is now at the centre of plans to design the new plaque on Colston's statue, which will recognise and acknowledge the people he and others in the city enslaved.The children will be joining Countering Colston members, Prof Dresser and the city council to help put Colston's legacy into context.Ms Swainson Price said it was ""amazing and appropriate"" for the children to ""to help review and redress the balance about how we remember and acknowledge Bristol's historical figures"" and ""importantly, the slaves themselves"".The man in charge of the project, the council's historic environment officer Pete Insole, said the people who were exploited by Colston are ""invisible"" in Bristol.He is helping to co-ordinate events during the summer about the city's links to the slave trade, which will culminate in the unveiling of the plaque. ""Slave traders are the most commemorated people in the city; we can't change the past but we can change the present and the future,"" he added.But for Ms Martin this is only the beginning: ""We have created debate... It's not just Bristol, it's a global narrative, it's about colonisation and decolonisation. ""Across Europe and across America the debate is very alive. We are questioning people and we are challenging society.""You are only here for a short time on Earth and I like to think we are bequeathing something better than we have inherited."" "

But the main focus was on the UK's future economic relationship with the European Union. The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris has been looking at a few key quotes from the speech.This was the key passage of Jeremy Corbyn's speech - putting clear water between Labour and the government. He wants to stay in a customs union to avoid the imposition of tariffs on goods traded within Europe, and to help solve the Brexit conundrum at the Irish border. As a member of the EU, the UK is currently in the customs union, which means that all countries impose a common external tariff - in effect the same tax - on goods being brought in from elsewhere in the world. Once those goods have crossed the external border, there are no further tariffs to move them around inside the customs union. Mr Corbyn wants to replicate most of that in a new customs union, which would certainly help companies who rely on moving goods across EU borders several times in their manufacturing process. But it wouldn't entirely solve the problem in Ireland, because some of the border issues - such as food safety or animal welfare - involve regulations that are nothing to do with the customs relationship.  Here Mr Corbyn addresses the government's primary reason for opposing the formation of a new customs union: that it would stop the UK doing trade deals around the world. He says he wants to ensure that the UK will be able to negotiate new trade deals ""in the national interest"".Although he is not explicit about what this involves in practice, it appears to mean that Labour wants the UK to be involved in negotiating those trade deals alongside the EU. He is not suggesting that the UK would be an entirely separate entity in international trade.Membership of a customs union constrains your ability to sign your own trade deals, because you can't alter external tariffs. But you can negotiate on services, or on harmonising regulations with other countries. Mr Corbyn argues that this is a compromise worth making, and it is another significant departure from government policy. The Conservatives accuse him of wanting to have his cake and eat it - a familiar theme. This is Mr Corbyn's political pitch, trying to peel enough Tory MPs away from the government to be able to defeat it in Parliament on the question of a customs union. He is trying to position Labour in the middle ground - supporting what appears to be a softer version of Brexit rather than what he would see as a hard ideological one. Of course anything Labour proposes, just like anything the government has proposed, does not have to win the approval of Parliament alone. It would also have to be negotiated with the rest of the EU, which remains suspicious of any UK effort to cherry-pick the best bits.  Mr Corbyn was very clear about this - attacking the government for starting with what he called rigid red lines on immigration and only afterwards working out what it meant for the economy. He says it is very clear that free movement of people from the EU would come to an end. There would, he says, be reasonable management of immigration, but the economy should always come first.This is a delicate balancing act. Without free movement of people, the UK will not get the same access to the single market that it has now. On the other hand, Labour can't ignore the ""take back control"" message entirely. But it is interesting to note that there was no mention at all in this speech of the future role of the European Court of Justice. It has always been clear that Jeremy Corbyn has never been a massive EU enthusiast. He says he campaigned for ""Remain with reform"" - which sounds suspiciously like David Cameron.But he was trying to appeal to both Remain and Leave voters in this speech, arguing that Brexit would lead neither to disaster nor to a land of milk and honey. Like the prime minister, he is trying to claim the Brexit middle ground. But, also like the prime minister, that doesn't mean he can sit on the fence, with little more than a year to go before Brexit is due to happen.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-02-27,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'.The BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."
2018-02-27,Party conferences 2017,https://web.archive.org//web/20180227183207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-41332364,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAutumn sees Britain's political parties gathering by the sea - or in big city conference centres - here's a round-up of this year's.The most memorable moments of the 2017 Conservative conference came at the very end, in a speech more eventful than Theresa May and her team could have imagined.The prime minister was plagued by a cough which left her relying on gulps of water - and even a cough sweet handed to her by the chancellor - to complete some lines.If that wasn't bad enough, prankster Simon Brodkin had somehow gained access to the conference floor and handed her a mocked-up P45.""I was about to talk about somebody I'd like to give a P45 to, and that's Jeremy Corbyn,"" the PM quipped, to cheers from the party faithful.It didn't end there - some of the letters fell off the conference stage backdrop behind her, leaving it as: ""Building a country that works or everyon.""The speech had been billed as the PM's attempt to reassert her authority after the ill-fated snap general election and reports of splits in her cabinet over Brexit.It also contained policy pledges on social housing and a cap on standard tariff energy bills, while Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced a ban on acid sales to under 18s and a tightening of the laws on viewing terrorist content online.In his speech, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who has been accused of undermining the PM with his interventions on Brexit strategy - said it was time to ""let the British lion roar"".Mrs May ended the conference being publicly supported by her MPs and ministers although there were reports of ""emerging plots"" among some MPs.Jeremy Corbyn ended Labour's week in Brighton with a speech to delegates in which he claimed the party was ""on the threshold of power"".The centre ground of British politics had shifted, he argued, and his Labour Party was now in the ""political mainstream"" because its polices were ""what most people in our country actually want"".He used the speech to announce some new policies - such as rent controls and curbs on gentrification - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another election campaign, with the Tory government ""hanging by a thread"".His supporters in the hall loved it, although they were chanting ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" for a full two minutes before he had even begun. This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound. But delegates approved changes to the way leaders are elected, which could make it easier to elect a left-wing successor to Mr Corbyn.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon insisted her party will ""always make the case for independence"" as she used her keynote speech to focus on domestic priorities rather than constitutional matters.Although the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said her party still had a mandate for a vote on the issue.The ""essence of independence"", she told activists, was being ""in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"" as she stressed the case for leaving the UK did not merely hinge on Brexit.Her headline policy announcement was a plan to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company by 2021.She argued the venture would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use with energy sold at ""close to cost price as possible"".Spending on early-years childcare in Scotland will be doubled to £840m by 2020, a move the SNP said would be ""truly transformational"", while there will be a new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August.The Liberal Democrats gathered by the seaside having modestly increased their tally of MPs to 12 in the recent general election, following an electoral drubbing in 2015 that left them with just eight.In his keynote speech to conference, new leader Sir Vince Cable said he could lead the Lib Dems back to power by offering a mix of ""hope and realism"".He called for higher taxes on foreign property speculators and second home owners to help tackle inequality.And he claimed Brexit would be an act of ""masochism"", leaving the UK poorer.UKIP members met for a two-day conference in which new leader Henry Bolton was crowned.The former soldier, who saw off challenges from better-known candidates, told members: ""Brexit is our core task. However it is not the end of the line.""Controversial anti-Islam candidate Anne Marie Waters finished second. Some MEPs had threatened to quit if she had won.UKIP's share of the vote in the general election collapsed to just 1.8%, prompting the resignation of then-leader Paul Nuttall.Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley spoke of the ""hurt"" he and others felt at the party's loss of ground in June's election, where its vote share more than halved.While the Greens had suffered at the hands of the two-party system in England and Wales, he said it could be proud of the causes it had espoused and the influence it had had on debates around austerity and fracking.Through its national and local representation, he said the party would stick up for the ""little guy"" as it made the case for far-reaching economic change. He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."

2018-02-28,May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draft,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43224785,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAn EU proposal for the Northern Ireland border threatens the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom, Theresa May has said.The EU's draft legal agreement proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in a customs union - if no other solution is found.Mrs May said ""no UK prime minister could ever agree"" to this.The EU says the ""backstop"" option is not intended to ""provoke"" the UK.Unveiling the draft agreement on what has proved to be a busy day for Brexit news, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier called on the UK to come up with alternatives.He said the text was ""no surprise"" and was just a legally-worded assessment of what had been agreed in the negotiations so far.The EU's 120-page paper covers the issues which have been negotiated so far - including the UK's financial settlement, citizens' rights and the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is a member of the EU - after Brexit.On how to avoid border checks in Northern Ireland, the EU says a ""backstop"" is needed in case neither of the UK's preferred solutions can be found.This would involve an ""area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods is ensured"", covering customs, VAT, energy, agriculture, goods and other sectors, across the island of Ireland.""The territory of Northern Ireland... shall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union,"" the document says.Other options - a UK-EU deal that means checks are not needed and technological solutions for a ""virtual"" border - will also be explored.Mr Barnier said the document contained ""concrete and realistic solutions"".The idea of separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland has provoked an angry reaction from the Democratic Unionist Party and some Conservative MPs who say it would effectively create a new border in the Irish Sea.Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May said she would be making her opposition to it ""crystal clear"" to the EU commission.""The draft legal text the commission have published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minster could ever agree to it,"" she said.The prime minister was responding to a question from David Simpson of the DUP, the party that gives the government the Commons support it needs to win key votes in the House of Commons.Earlier the DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said his reaction to the publication was one of ""amazement"" that the EU thought it ""could possibly fly with either us or the British government"".""We did not leave the European Union to oversee the breakup of the United Kingdom,"" he told the BBC, adding that it would be ""catastrophic"" for Northern Ireland to be ""cut off"" from UK markets.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested the row over the border was being used to keep the UK inside the customs union.But Labour said the EU-UK government ""war of words"" needs to end.""Theresa May's failure to offer any viable solution to the border in Northern Ireland has come back to haunt her,"" said shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Kier Starmer.In December both sides came up with an agreement that Downing Street hailed as a ""breakthrough"" and meant the EU agreed to move talks on to the next phase.It included a promise to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic.But the EU says that the next phase of negotiations - which includes drawing up a post-Brexit transition and opening trade talks on permanent post-Brexit relations - can only progress if December's agreement is ""translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible"".And doing this has reopened the debate about the Northern Ireland border.Downing Street said that overall the negotiations were ""progressing well"", adding that ""it would be surprising at this point if we did agree on everything"".The Irish government said the publication was ""another important step in the Brexit negotiations"".Ireland's foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said the ""backstop"" option was ""very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary"".Labour says it would solve the Irish border question by entering into a new customs union with the EU, meaning checks are not needed as people and goods pass between Northern Ireland and the Republic.As well as the Irish border, another area of contention is the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ).The UK has said it will leave the ECJ's jurisdiction and regain control of its laws after Brexit.According to the EU's draft document, disputes over the Brexit agreement in future years would be settled by a ""joint committee"" made up of representatives from both sides.But the EU proposes that this committee would be able to refer to the European Court of Justice for a binding ruling - with the EU's court having the power to levy a fine or suspend parts of the Brexit treaty.The EU is also insisting that EU citizens who arrive in Britain during the transition period have the same right to stay in the country as those who arrived before Brexit - the UK has said these people should be treated differently as their ""expectations"" will be different.In a new policy paper, the UK said people arriving during transition would be able to apply for indefinite leave to remain in the UK - with their rights subject to UK law.Mr Barnier stressed that the document was a draft and would now be circulated among the 27 other EU nations and the European Parliament's Brexit steering group for revision and agreement before being placed on the negotiating table.UK negotiators will work with the EU to see how December's commitments can be translated into legal form, Theresa May said.Attention will then soon turn to Friday, when the prime minister is to make a speech setting out the UK's strategy for the next phase of negotiations.Key to this will be how closely the UK seeks to stay to EU rules in order to maintain a close trading relationship.Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has, meanwhile, said Conservative MPs must vote with their ""own conscience"" on whether to accept the final deal reached between the UK and the EU.In a speech in London, he said they could decide on a new referendum.Sir John said ""both democracy and prudence"" suggest that parties should not dictate to their MPs how to vote.""Brexit is a unique decision,"" he added. ""It will affect the lives of the British nation for generations to come. If it flops - there will be the most terrible backlash.But Eurosceptic MPs were not impressed with his suggestion. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - who rebelled on EU votes during Sir John's time in Downing Street - told the BBC: ""He was not a prime minister who was too keen on free votes when he was there.""Backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said Sir John had been wrong on Europe in the past ""and he is getting it wrong again""."
2018-02-28,Give MPs free vote on Brexit deal - Major,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43229964,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs should be given a free vote on whether to accept or reject the final Brexit deal, Sir John Major has said.The ex-prime minister argues that MPs must vote with their ""own conscience"" on whether the deal on offer will leave the UK better or worse off. And, in a speech in London, he said they could decide on a new referendum. Leading Tory backbencher and Brexit backer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Sir John had been wrong on Europe in the past ""and he is getting it wrong again"".""We had a democratic vote, the decision has been taken and what he is trying to do is overturn that,"" he told BBC News.Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Sir John insisted he was not ""targeting"" Theresa May and he genuinely wished her well in getting the best deal for Britain.But he said some of the advice she was getting from within her own party was ""very unwelcome from the point of view of the wellbeing of the country"". Sir John, whose time as Conservative prime minister from 1990 to 1997 featured long-running battles with Eurosceptics in his party, has long been a critic of the UK's decision to leave the EU, having campaigned alongside David Cameron on the Remain side in the 2016 referendum.Brexit has become the most ""divisive"" political issue of his lifetime, he said in the speech to the Creative Industries Federation.He said the promises made by Leave campaigners during the referendum had yet to be met and were unlikely to be, describing the aspiration to spend an extra £350m a week on the NHS as a ""ridiculous phantom"".""Many electors know they were misled: Many more are beginning to realise it. So, the electorate has every right to reconsider their decision.""Sir John challenged what he said was the argument Brexit would have little impact on the UK, arguing that while the British people would ""get through it"", it was likely to leave the country ""weaker and less prosperous"" and a ""diminished"" force on the world stage. Given the emerging evidence that Brexit will ""hurt most those who have the least"", he said the government must ""change course"" and rethink its negotiating strategy, based on what was practically achievable rather than what he said were the demands of a ""minority of ultra-Brexiteers"".While he did not enjoy being ""out of step"" with his party, the stakes were so high than he felt obliged to speak out at such a crucial moment in the negotiations.""Leaving Europe is an issue so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it will have an impact on all our lives - most especially on the young and the future,"" he said.""With only 12 months to go, we need answers, not aspirations.""While he was not actively calling for a further referendum, he said the ""option"" must remain open to a ""sovereign"" Parliament to insist upon.The ""meaningful"" vote promised by Theresa May on the final agreement must be ""a decisive vote, in which Parliament can accept or reject the final outcome; or send the negotiators back to seek improvements; or order a referendum so the public may approve what has been determined"".""Brexit is a unique decision,"" he added. ""It will affect the lives of the British nation for generations to come.  If it flops - there will be the most terrible backlash.""If Brexit is whipped through Parliament, at a time when the public are so divided about it, voters will know who to blame if they end up poorer and weaker. So, both democracy and prudence suggest a free vote.  ""The deep divisions in our nation are more likely to be healed by a Brexit freely approved by Parliament, than a Brexit forced through Parliament at the behest of a minority of convinced opponents of Europe.""Speaking to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg after the speech, he insisted he was not ""targeting"" Theresa May and he genuinely wished her well in securing her aims.""What I said was that there are people with ultra-Brexit views who are trying to stamp those views on the government because the parliamentary arithmetic Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said the idea of another referendum was ""rather absurd"".""We have to leave because the British people have said we should leave and we have to make the arrangements we can,"" he said. ""We have had a referendum, they have spoken and I think that is enough.""Mr Rees-Mogg suggested the former PM was talking ""complete humbug"" over the issue as rather than permitting free votes during the Maastricht battles of the early 1990s, Eurosceptic rebels were subject to the ""most aggressive"" form of whipping, with many being effectively thrown out of the party. ""You would expect John Major, a former prime minister, to make a statesmanlike speech, free of propaganda and cheap comments, when in fact, it's all cheap comments and propaganda,"" he said.""This isn't a statesmanlike speech, this is one of somebody grubbing around in the weeds for weak arguments and it's a very poor speech in that regard."""

Mrs May repeated that her government was committed to the Good Friday agreement.“In 2012, the PM talked about a ‘future in which Scotland, Wales, NI and England continue to flourish side-by-side as equal partners’.

Again and again she said no British prime minister could possibly accept a Brexit settlement with the EU that separated Northern Ireland from the EU.Faced with direct questions from the DUP, and softer questions from her own backbenchers, as well as considerable mockery from Jeremy Corbyn, she set her face against any deal which undermined the constitutional integrity of the UK and the common market within the UK. Job done for now - but has the Boris Johnson letter eroded faith in the government among its indispensable allies?The foreign secretary is now a target. He is mocked, he is derided and he knows it and shows it. And his departure from the chamber, leaving an urgent question about his letter for his cabinet colleague David Lidington to answer, will do nothing to enhance his position.Meanwhile, I am pleased to announce a birth. To Jeremy Corbyn, a soundbite. It was small, a little on the light side, but lusty: ""When is she going to put the country's interests before the outsized egos in her own cabinet?""There is now an expectation that many siblings will be spawned in future PMQs. The Labour leader managed to combine questions and mockery in today's outing... and he is flailing around rather less than he did at the start of his leadership.In classic Westminster debating terms, he is doing better. But is he, in the process, losing the outsider style and focus on grassroots concerns that he first brought to PMQs?He didn't dent the PM with that style of questioning, but maybe he reached people via the news bulletins and social media. And maybe he has now been sucked into a more conventional Westminster political attack?Quite a moment when Jeremy Corbyn cites the CBI and the Institute of Directors against a Conservative prime minister. #PMQsEnd of Twitter post  by @georgeeatonTheresa May not exactly keeping her options open re customs-union compromise at #PMQs: it wd ""betray the vote of the people""End of Twitter post  by @JohnRentoulLabour benches shouting, chanting even, frit at Boris Johnson as he leaves the Chamber ahead of the urgent question on his comments on the Irish borderEnd of Twitter post  by @JGForsythThis week in @afneil's PMQs podcast, discussion on Brexit & 'ambitious managed divergence'.

The UK says it should last around two years from March 2019. Those arriving in the UK after 29 March 2019, the day Britain leaves the EU, will have to register with the authorities if they want to stay longer than three months.They will then be allowed to stay for five years ""working, studying or being self-sufficient"" to qualify to apply for indefinite leave to remain, part of the process of becoming a UK citizen.EU citizens who have been continually living in the EU for five years by 29 March 2019 will be able to apply to stay indefinitely by getting ""settled status"". They will be able to bring spouses and other family members to the UK automatically under EU free movement rules.Those who arrive after Brexit day will also be able to bring family members to the UK under free movement rules, during the transition period.But - in the main change to the current arrangements - when the transition period has ended they will have to abide by the rules that currently apply to British citizens who want to be joined by family members from outside the EU, such as the minimum income requirement.Since July 2012, UK citizens and settled residents applying to bring a non-EU partner to the country must be earning at least £18,600 per year before tax. The threshold is higher for those who are also sponsoring children.Asked how the Home Office proposals differed from free movement - something Theresa May has always insisted will end in March next year - the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We'll have a registration system and some of their rights will be different.

2018-02-28,Why English courts are opening in the EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-42979920,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt's English law, in English - but the courtroom is in Paris.According to French reports, the new ""international chamber"" is an attempt to capitalise on Brexit and steal London's crown as a global hub for lucrative commercial legal disputes.Other English-language courts are popping up in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium, with those behind them also talking about seizing opportunities from the UK's departure from the EU.English courts have long been chosen by companies based all over the world to govern their contracts. So are these new rivals a threat to London's crown?French justice minister Nicole Belloubet, who tweeted an English ""welcome"" at the formal signing of the new chamber earlier this month, said in December that the UK's exit from the EU could mean it losing access to a ""common judicial space"" with the attractiveness of London courts ""replaced by other European jurisdictions"".And the head of the Paris Bar, Marie-Aimee Peyron, has said that in light of Brexit, the French capital's new appeals court could help it become the world's commercial law centre.As the planned Brussels International Business Court was announced in October, Belgium's Prime Minister Charles Michel described the UK's departure from the EU as an ""opportunity"" for his country.This court will offer companies the chance to settle cross-border disputes in English, although only using Belgian law.""The development of the European Union cannot be slowed down by Brexit,"" Mr Michel added.Meanwhile, announcing an English-speaking court in Frankfurt in November, its president, Wilhelm Wolf, spoke of attracting business from English courts to his city, claiming English judgements would become harder to enforce after Brexit.This would be bad news for the UK's legal sector, which says it is worth £26bn to the economy.""While it's starting fairly small it could have rapid repercussions,"" says Conservative MP Bob Neill, who is chairman of the Commons Justice Committee.""It is an interesting trend and it's something that if you are concerned about the health of UK legal services PLC, one ought to be alert to.""Protocole signé #chambrecommercialeinternationale de Paris. #welcome @justice_gouv pic.twitter.com/QyRFHxDJbuEnd of Twitter post  by @NBelloubetKey to the warnings about London losing its crown is an EU regulation that allows judgements in one member state to be enforced across the bloc - and which Mr Neill's justice committee says needs to be replicated ""as closely as possible"" after Brexit.Otherwise, rulings made in London may not be automatically recognised in the EU - there could be extra paperwork, confusion about which jurisdiction should hear a case, and an overall loss of certainty.Mickaël Laurans, of the Law Society of England and Wales, said that after Brexit businesses may face ""additional procedural steps"" if the EU regulation no longer applies.This will depend on the negotiations between the UK and the EU - the UK has said it wants a ""close cooperative relationship"" with the EU's legal system after it leaves, but details have yet to be agreed.Nonetheless, supporters of the English system are confident it will retain its crown.""England and Wales's jurisdiction has a number of strengths which are completely independent of Brexit,"" said Mr Laurans, citing its ""high quality judges who understand highly complex cases"".""Just having English language proceedings would not be enough to attract foreign litigants away from England and Wales,"" he predicted.However, the French court - which opens on Thursday - will go further than than those in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany by having the power to make rulings on English law.This is an ""an interesting phenomenon"" which could be part of a ""charm offensive"" aimed at the City of London, Mr Laurans said.""It's something to look closely at.""A spokeswoman for the French Embassy in London played down the relevance of Brexit in the decision to open the new facility, which will sit inside the existing Paris international tribunal.It will allow people to address the court and submit documentation in English, with judgements translated from French into English, and judges trained in the English common law system.""It's not really the context of Brexit, it's the context of what we call attractiveness. We want companies to feel at ease using English when they have commercial litigation,"" the embassy spokeswoman told the BBC.""Of course Brexit has an influence and an impact on what's going on, but this was not a decision taken as a result of Brexit.""Last year the justice committee warned that failing to protect the UK's status as a ""top-class commercial law centre"" would have ""clear impacts on the UK economy"".Sir Richard Aikens, a former Lord Justice who is president of the Leave-campaigning Lawyers for Britain group, echoed their sentiments but played down any possible impact of the Anglophone French courtroom.""I do not expect it to be any kind of threat,"" he told the BBC, adding that the judges would not have been trained in English law, which he described as ""predominantly the commercial law of the planet"".The ""real question"", he said, is what will replace the aforementioned Brussels regulation allowing judgements to be enforced throughout the EU, with the role of the European Court of Justice likely to be a sticking point.MP Bob Neill - who comes from the other side of the Brexit debate - agrees.""It is an issue that we have really got to take seriously,"" he said.""I don't think it's getting enough attention.""In a paper in August, the government set out its desire for a ""new civil judicial cooperation framework, as an aspect of the deep and special partnership with the EU"".Ministers have also said that ""an effective system of cross-border judicial cooperation with common rules is essential to embed certainty and predictability for businesses particularly for those with a commercial aspect"".But like many things, how this will work will be thrashed out over the negotiating table in the months to come."
2018-02-28,Johnson says NI border row being exploited,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43221934,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBoris Johnson has said the row over the border in Northern Ireland is being used to frustrate Brexit.The foreign secretary insisted there were ""very good solutions"" to avoid the need for a hard border.There is a stand-off on the issue with the EU publishing a legal draft of its Brexit withdrawal agreement.An option for Northern Ireland to follow EU rules to avoid a ""hard border"" - if an alternative arrangement is not agreed - has sparked a row.The Democratic Unionist Party, which offers vital support in key votes to the Tory government, says details of the draft treaty have ""fundamentally breached"" an agreement reached in Brussels late last year.Conservative Brexiteers say it is ""completely unacceptable"" and would effectively annex Northern Ireland.The European Union's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, unveiling the draft agreement, described this Northern Ireland border option as a ""backstop"" if no other proposals are found. And a former EU commissioner said it was down to the UK to come up with a solution, warning that ""at a high pace we are heading to the cliff edge"".BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was shaping up to become ""the big Brexit bust-up"" with both sides of the argument refusing to budge.Mr Johnson faced criticisism on Tuesday for suggesting in a BBC interview the issue of the border could be managed as easily as London's congestion charging zone.Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, he said: ""What is going on at the moment is that the issue of the Northern Irish border is being used quite a lot politically to try and keep the UK in the customs union - effectively the single market - so we cannot really leave the EU. That is what is going on.""""If the EU or Dublin believes the UK government will be signing up to a border in the Irish Sea, they are deluded,"" said senior DUP member Sir Jeffrey Donaldson.Mr Donaldson argued the draft divorce treaty would also undermine the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in the Belfast Agreement.That 1998 treaty - also known as the Good Friday Agreement - between the British and Irish governments and most political parties in Northern Ireland decided how the region would be governed and brought an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict.Former Brexit minister David Jones told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the EU was proposing that Northern Ireland stay in the customs union, and subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.""That effectively amounts to an annexure of Northern Ireland by the European Union,"" he said, adding: ""I think that it would be pretty catastrophic and I think that the European Union in actually proposing this is behaving wholly irresponsibly.""But former EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht said: ""If you have another solution then please come up with it.""All of the UK's proposals so far have been ""mutually incompatible"", he added.And Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE that in order to avoid the backstop being triggered,  ""it is up to the UK to bring proposals to the table to make that possible"".He added: ""It's not OK for people, whether pro-Brexit politicians in Britain, people or parties in Northern Ireland, to just say 'no' now.""The draft document aims to encapsulate - in legally binding language - agreements already reached on Ireland, citizens' rights and the UK's so-called ""divorce bill"".It mandates that during the Brexit transition, which it says should last only until the end of 2020, the UK must continue to comply with all existing EU legislation. It would however lose all voting rights and decision-making power, including on any rules adopted by the 27 remaining member states.EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said the document will not contain any surprises because it translates the political pledges made by both sides in the talks so far.""The clock is ticking; time is short,"" Mr Barnier said at a news conference on Tuesday. ""I am concerned.""Theresa May wants trade to be frictionless across the Irish border after Brexit. But there is plenty of political friction as every potential solution seems to bring a new problem.In a leaked letter designed to demonstrate that there would be no need for new infrastructure between Northern Ireland and the Republic, Boris Johnson used a potentially toxic phrase: ""even IF there is a hard border"".This allowed critics to suggest that a regime of border checks which would be anathema to republicans, nationalists and the Irish government was being contemplated.Downing Street swiftly reiterated its commitment to no hard border.But one of the solutions - indeed, the most detailed option - being put forward by the EU would keep Northern Ireland aligned with EU regulations.The DUP's Jeffrey Donaldson has said the government cannot sign up to what would in effect be a border in the Irish Sea. And with rebellions threatened by some of her own backbenchers, Mrs May is likely to need the DUP's MPs to deliver the Brexit she's promising.The prime minister's office has categorically dismissed any prospect of a return to a ""hard border"" in Ireland as a consequence of Brexit.The statement on Tuesday evening followed the leak of a letter to the prime minister from Mr Johnson, in which he appeared to contemplate the possibility of future customs border checks, after the UK, including Northern Ireland leaves the EU customs union.The leaked letter, obtained by Sky News, quoted Mr Johnson telling the prime minister the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland would continue to leave 95% of traffic to pass unchecked.Following the letter's emergence, Labour called for Mr Johnson - one of the leading Brexiteers in the cabinet - to be dismissed ""before he can do any more damage"". A spokesman for Mr Johnson said the letter was ""designed to outline how a highly facilitated border would work and help to make a successful Brexit"".""It shows how we could manage a border without infrastructure or related checks and controls while protecting UK, Northern Ireland, Irish and EU interests."""

And I don't think we can.""He stressed: ""If there is incontrovertible evidence of the use of chemical weapons, verified by the Office of the Prevention of Chemical Weapons - if we know that it's happened and we can demonstrate it, and if there is a proposal for action where the UK could be useful, then I think we should seriously consider it.""On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution calling for a 30-day ceasefire, but it did not set a specific start date.Russia said the five-hour pause in bombardment would run from 09:00 until 14:00 local time (07:00-12:00 GMT) daily.The Syrian Red Crescent would help set up the humanitarian corridor and residents would be informed about how to leave via leaflets, text messages and videos, it added."

""I obviously would not have done that if I knew of its existence,"" he told the Press Association.""My record in motor-sport demonstrates that I do not tolerate racism and, like most people, my political views have changed over time.""The former Formula 1 boss was presented with a photocopy of the leaflet, for Union Movement candidate Walter Hesketh in the 1961 Moss Side by-election, during an interview with Channel 4 News.Max Mosley questioned over racist leaflet https://t.co/O10Fa57AuuEnd of Twitter post  by @Channel4NewsThe leaflet, which says it was ""published by Max Mosley"", includes the warning: ""Protect your health. There is no medical check on immigration. Tuberculosis, VD [venereal (sexually transmitted) disease] and other terrible diseases like leprosy are on the increase. Coloured immigration threatens your children's health.""It also states that ""if enough people vote for me in this election, the government... will be sending coloured immigrants home, instead of bringing more in"" and urges voters to ""let us give the coloured people a fair deal by sending them back to good jobs and good wages at home in Jamaica"".Asked about the line ""Coloured immigration threatens your children's health,"" Mr Mosley said: ""I think that probably is racist, I will concede that completely.""But he said he had ""no reason to apologise to anyone"", adding: ""This was a statement in a leaflet which I am not even sure is genuine, which would never reflect my view, it would not reflect my view then or now because I simply wouldn't dream of insulting people.""He told Channel 4 News: ""If that leaflet is genuine, I am responsible for it and it shouldn't have been issued"".But he said: ""I have never been a racist. I am not a racist, never will be a racist.""He was also quizzed about whether he was a ""fit and proper person"" to be funding the office of Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, which has received £500,000 from Mr Mosley.""Why should I not support Tom Watson, who is probably one of the most honest and courageous politicians we have got?"" he said.In a statement to the Daily Mail, Mr Watson said: ""My views on press regulation are well known and have not changed.""The views expressed by Max as a young man are not the views he holds now, just as the Rothermere family [owners of Associated Newspapers, the publishers of the Daily Mail] no longer uses its newspapers to support fascism.""Mr Mosley has campaigned for tighter press regulation since the News of the World wrongly reported his sado-masochistic sex session had been ""Nazi-themed"", and has donated funds to press regulator Impress.He is also attempting to use data protection laws to delete references to what he calls this ""private party"" and what he says are inaccurate references about his relationship to Impress.He told the Press Association he would ""continue to campaign for the vital reforms needed to protect ordinary people against the bullying of newspapers like the Daily Mail""."

The two governments have been at loggerheads over how powers which are currently not reserved to Westminster, but which are exercised from Brussels, are distributed after the UK leaves the EU.Ms Sturgeon said she accepted that in some cases there would need to be common systems of regulation, but she insisted that they needed to be agreed between the UK government and the devolved administrations - and cannot be imposed by Westminster.She said: ""We are simply trying to protect the powers that the Scottish Parliament already has - things like agriculture, fishing, environmental policy, food standards, justice, health.""These are all currently responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament. At the moment we have to exercise those powers within the confines of European law.""But after Brexit, in terms of the devolution settlement, those powers should return to the Scottish Parliament and it should be up to us how we exercise them.""On Monday, Mr Lidington said the UK's ""common market"" must be maintained post-Brexit, saying the UK works better in ""unity"".Food labelling and hygiene rules were one area where powers could be retained within a UK-wide framework, Mr Lidington suggested.He added that the government had made a ""considerable offer"" to the devolved administrations.Let's be clear - the devolved administrations cannot veto Brexit, they cannot block, they cannot thwart.The talk of there being a requirement for consent from the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly is purely a convention, and hasn't got weight in law.Westminster is sovereign, and Westminster can legislate in this matter.If Westminster wants, it can say: ""If we can get this EU Withdrawal Bill through the House of Commons and through the House of Lords, then that's good enough for us and the rest of you can go swing."" But Westminster will not do that. Why? Because they want to proceed by consensus. The UK government is in enough trouble over Brexit without adding a fight with Holyrood into the mix as well.Ms Sturgeon said her government had always accepted there were issues where it makes sense to have common standards and regulations in all parts of the UK.But she said the UK government proposals meant Holyrood would have no say over any attempt by Westminster to lower environmental standards in Scotland - despite the powers being devolved.The first minister added: ""I will not sign up to something that effectively undermines the whole foundation on which devolution is built and no first minister, no Scottish government worth its salt, should do so.""She denied she was using the row as an excuse to push for independence, and insisted that the Scottish government was trying to reach agreement.But she said that, as things currently stand, it was ""very likely"" that both the Scottish and Welsh governments would ask their respective parliaments to not recommend approval of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Talks are continuing as the EU Withdrawal Bill makes its way through the House of Lords.The bill aims to ensure the rules currently set by European law still apply in the UK after Brexit, while giving the UK Parliament power to change them.The Scottish government is expected to introduce its own EU Continuity Bill at Holyrood this week."

The prime minister could hardly have been clearer that she will reject the EU's position today. The lines are drawn for a fight over the draft treaty that will run for many weeks. But there are broader concerns that it's not just that issue that's extremely hard to solve, but suggestions today that the government's whole approach might in fact be an impossible compromise.The former Prime Minister, Sir John Major, is often mocked by some of his former colleagues. A veteran of course of his own battles with Eurosceptics, among Brexiteers his views are derided. His speech today may even be seen in some quarters as part of a Remain plot - Brussels, the Labour Party and political bigwigs somehow working together to thwart Theresa May. But his strongly-worded plea for Parliament to be given more power over Brexit, and his criticisms of the government's approach, may crystallise the concerns that many Tories have, and likely, some members of the public too. His essential case? That the prime minister this time round relies so much on the support of ""ultra Brexiteers"" as he calls them, that she is heading for a deal that could harm the country, with no consideration for reasonable compromise or pragmatism. In that case, he is urging her to give MPs a vote on the final deal, with the power to reject it, and even potentially give the country a say too on the final deal in a second referendum. It won't take long to cue calls of voter fatigue, interference from the establishment, or a refusal from Remainers to accept that they lost the argument in 2016. But today's call from Sir John will give succour to those Conservatives who have been pushing for Parliament to be more vigorous in making its views heard, and urging Number 10 to take more account of those trying to find a middle ground.  And just at the moment when Theresa May is trying to inch her party forward, a warning, from prime minister to prime minister, not just that her approach is wrongheaded, but that her ultimate goal may be impossible to achieve.

Of the 39 men elected to represent Blackburn, 19 are Asian men; there are no Asian women councillors.""When I stood, it was to raise issues that women face,"" says 46-year-old Ms Afzal, who is standing again in May's local elections. ""We should be able to work and have a full education. I felt the [issues] weren't prevalent at the time and we needed to raise them.""But the town's MP Kate Hollern believes it is ""more difficult"" for Asian women from traditional families to get involved in politics. ""Asian women play a prominent role in many local organisations - all of which feed into the decision-making process of the area. ""It may be however that the structures of elected politics, with frequent evening and weekend meetings, make it difficult for women who remain generally the main carers in families, to get more involved.""But is it really as simple as a difference in culture which traditionally casts men as the dominant breadwinner and decision-maker, while the women focus on family and home?Some political parties would disagree. They say they have been trying for years to change the landscape in Blackburn by fielding Asian female candidates in local elections.But their attitude for change has so far not been matched at the polls. Homeless 'devastated' by doorway deathIndia mourns Bollywood superstar SrideviNZ reacts to 'creepy' PM Ardern interviewMalcolm Doherty, who was on the council from 1980 to 2012, claims that during his tenure he detected an ""anti-woman feeling"" and ""the men [in Asian wards] wouldn't vote for them"".The former Labour councillor said: ""It was quite strong at that time, they didn't want [Asian] women councillors. I could never understand it. ""It was very difficult, we tried to get them [elected] in Asian wards and then to wards which weren't Asian, but weren't successful.""Saima stood and she was a very good candidate. It was a sad loss she wasn't elected.""Blackburn, neighbouring Darwen and parts of Turton joined in 1998 to form a unitary authority, which is currently Labour-run with 48 male and 16 female councillors. While Darwen and Turton has a Middle Eastern female councillor of Jordanian descent, it has no representation from the Asian community, male or female.It is in stark contrast to similar towns not far from Blackburn, such as Oldham, Rochdale and Bury, where at least one Asian woman has been elected to the council.The nearby Chorley authority has two - Hasina Khan and her daughter, Zara, 23. The former became interested in politics in 2003 after she had ""absolutely had enough"" of the monotony of ""cooking, cleaning and school runs"".""Blackburn has this biradari [tribal/clan network] system more like the Pakistani politics back home, which is of course male-dominated and where the heads of families are men who make most decisions. ""This is one of the main reasons why there are no Asian female councillors.""Encouraged by her MP Lindsay Hoyle to go out canvassing, she joined Labour before standing as a candidate - going on in 2006 to become the first Asian female councillor in Lancashire outside the unitary authorities.She accepts women have a ""caring responsibility"" in their culture, but said when she stood the support from her family, in ""particular the men, [was] excellent"".""The electorate [in Chorley] was 99% non-Asian, there was no tribal system here to try block me.""She describes hitting a brick wall when trying to recruit other Asian women to stand.""The biggest hindrance is family themselves, fathers, brothers, husbands. They say 'what's the community going to say?' and 'politics isn't for women, they should be looking after the home'.""   Political activist Farzana Afzal, who is based in Manchester, says some Asian women are ""too occupied in their house work, children and household duties"", while others face a language barrier.""The women who've come from abroad, they don't watch BBC News or mainstream channels because they can't follow it. They watch Pakistani channels about politics over there.""The knock-on effect, according to teenagers in the town, is that there are no female role models in Blackburn. At the West End Girls group - set up to help youngsters develop leadership skills - Taybah, 15, thinks Asian women are ""not being represented"".""I think culture is potentially holding them back,"" adds Huma, 15. ""It's a full time job, Asian women are attached to their families. ""The idea isn't put into your mind when you're young [to be in politics].""Conservative group leader John Slater believes the ""cultural issue... seems to be a trait in Blackburn"".""I'm quite sad about it, the opportunities are there but they're not being taken up,"" he says.Parliament is currently at its most diverse with 52 of the 650 MPs elected from ethnic minorities. Of those, 26 were women - representing just 4% of all MPs. With those figures, ""it is therefore no surprise that Asian women at the grassroots level of politics do not think [it] is an arena for them,"" says Rushanara Ali, Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow.She believes there should be more government help to encourage ethnic minorities to get into local politics.The mantle is being taken up in cities where there are large Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities such as Birmingham, Leicester, Manchester and Bradford, where there are up to eight Asian women on their councils.But unsociable hours and commitments to constituents could still prevent Asian women in towns like Blackburn from getting involved, says Dr Victoria Honeyman, British politics lecturer at the University of Leeds.""This all eats into family time and, again, as the caring responsibilities tend to fall unevenly on women, particularly in traditional family units as is common in Asian communities, it can create additional barriers to women engaging in politics.""The local elections will be the next opportunity for Asian women to challenge the status quo through the ballot box."""

2018-02-28,What EU wants,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43224166,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union has published a legal draft of its Brexit withdrawal agreement with the UK. Here's a guide.This document turns the political pledges made by both sides in December when the prime minister made an early-morning trip to Brussels into the kind of water-tight legal language found in a typical EU treaty. So it is not going to be light reading. But it is historically significant because it will eventually become the document that seals the UK's departure from the EU. It has been prepared by the European Commission's Task Force 50, led by chief negotiator Michel Barnier. The 27 remaining EU countries have the right to make changes but Mr Barnier has been working within a framework set by them so it should reflect what they want. Commission officials say they just wanted to get a move on and get some text on the table.  Three possible options have been agreed for preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Option A is a future relationship between the UK and the EU that avoids the need for a border. Option B is that unique solutions - like technology - are found to solve the issue. Option C is that Northern Ireland remains aligned with EU rules in a number of areas.C is the one that gets most attention in the text but the EU has bent over backwards to say that the other two options are still viable… as long as the UK provides more information about them. This document is a basis for negotiations with the government. There are some areas where the two sides have not reached agreement yet and so some of the wording will reflect an EU-only position. For example, Brussels says that the European Court of Justice should oversee the Brexit treaty. Therefore the document refers to the ECJ. The UK doesn't agree. They will have to reach a compromise. The draft is more than 120 pages long and contains 168 paragraphs (called ""articles"" in the EU jargon). It contains several annexes and protocols - sections that appear outside the main body of the text. These count just as much. For example, the UK's original opt-outs from European Justice and Home Affairs policies, the Euro and the Schengen Area are contained in protocols added to end of the EU's main treaties. The treaty settles the terms of the UK's exit. The EU says that the shape of the future relationship with Britain will be spelled out in a political declaration to be agreed later in the year and to be attached to the Brexit Treaty. Talks about that won't begin until April at the earliest. "

The level of scrutiny that has taken place, in my experience, is unprecedented. We are pleased the structure has held up to that kind of scrutiny.""With the bill - which was debated for 85 hours in the Commons - having now moved on to the House of Lords, her team's work is far from over, but she believes it remains in good shape despite being subjected to a blizzard of proposed changes by MPs.""Given what it is doing and what it is achieving, I think it strikes a very good balance,"" she says. ""A week after the referendum, I kept reading things that said this bill, when it came forward, would be three clauses. It is fanciful it could be done in three clauses, but neither is it 300.""The 51 year-old solicitor, the first woman to hold the post of first parliamentary counsel, has a gimlet eye when it comes to making sure bills hold together and, in modern political parlance, are fit for purpose. After nearly three decades as a parliamentary drafter, she is an accomplished exponent of her art but still expresses a disarming measure of surprise as well as pride at her role operating ""at the heart of government"".""I was planning to be a High Street solicitor in some sleepy town in Scotland,"" she says.Bills were originally drafted by normal barristers, MPs themselves or members of the judiciary. William Pitt was the first person to appoint a dedicated parliamentary draftsman.Barrister Henry Thring was appointed to head the newly created Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury in 1869, a post he held for more than 30 years.The OPC was initially part of the Treasury, but was absorbed into the new Civil Service Department in 1969,  changing its name to simply the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.That was until she read an ""interesting"" job advert for a parliamentary drafter in the early 1990s and soon found herself among stimulating although rather different company to that she had been used to.""The culture of the office then was quite male and Oxbridge, which was not my background. I would probably have found that quite difficult if I hadn't always loved the work.""I think it is the sort of job that you either love or hate, probably - I think it's a bit Marmitey. People leave very quickly if they don't like it, but there are a lot of people who come and stay a long time.""She was one of those who stayed, in her early years helping to write the Maastricht bill for John Major's government before being caught up in the legislative whirlwind that marked New Labour's early years in office.""What they used to say was that every Labour government legislated more than a Tory government but that every government legislated more than the previous one, of that colour,"" she says.""I have no scientific evidence for that, but we were certainly producing a lot of legislation in the early 2000s.""This put a strain on the department's capacity to do its job as, for different reasons, did the retrenchment in the civil service that followed the coalition government's post-2010 austerity drive.That period of cuts has now come to an end. She has 48 lawyers at her disposal from a diverse range of backgrounds, working directly on writing government legislation, including six recruited in the past year.The ""very specialist"" nature of the role means there is no ready-made production line for talent as there may be elsewhere in Whitehall and there is a huge emphasis on taking on the right people and then nurturing them.""Because it takes so long to train someone, we have to be very conscious about the future of the office. You can't just turn on a tap or go out into the market and find someone who can draft legislation.""As part of the recruitment process, candidates are asked to dissect a spoof government bill to determine whether they have the combination of intellectual rigour, analytical powers and flair to do the job.""There are people who look at it and can spot a few typos and there are others who pull it to bits and explain why it does not work. We need people who can deconstruct but can also reconstruct. ""You do get people who are very good at critiquing other people's drafting but when faced with a blank piece of paper find it extremely difficult to find a way in to creating a structure to produce that.""The drafting process, she says, needs consistency, collaboration and the ability to ask searching questions of ministers and their advisers, who are sometimes ""very close to the policy and can't see the bigger picture"". While bills very rarely ""collapse"" because of internal contradictions, they often end up looking rather different from how they started out.""One of my colleagues used to describe it as 'You have crafted an elephant and think it is a pretty good elephant and you are half way through Parliament and they decide they want a crocodile.'""You have got bits of the elephant chopped off and some bits stuck on. At the end of the day, maybe it is a functioning crocodile but not as nice a crocodile as you would have created.""MPs and peers cannot lobby drafters directly on the wording of bills but can, of course, make their own linguistic changes. While ""heavily amended"" bills present a challenge what worries her more is lack of scrutiny. ""You don't want to assume that no-one in Parliament is saying anything relevant.""You have to be quite thick skinned. But 999 times out of 1,000, when someone says the bill is not well drafted, they really mean, 'I don't like the policy in the bill.'""With increasing public interest in the law-making process - the legislation.gov.uk website gets two million hits a year - there has been a deliberate effort to cut out unnecessary jargon and make bills more accessible. ""Most bills won't be as difficult to read as people think they are,"" she says. ""If you compare an act from now to one from the late-1980s, it is written far more in everyday English.""The ultimate test of legislation remains its basic legality, but as a handful of bills over the past 30 years have shown - the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act, for example - it is equally damaging for legislation to be found wanting in the court of public opinion.""I sometimes think certain pieces of legislation get a bad name and there is no way back, whether it is based on fact or not,"" she says. ""There are periods in history - and it is not a comment on the Dangerous Dogs Act particularly - where you would look at the front page of a tabloid newspaper and realise what it was you might be legislating for in reaction to that. There certainly has been some of that.""The risk of kneejerk legislative responses to a personal tragedy or institutional failure will never disappear.The increasing tendency of ministers to trail proposals in Green and White Papers or publish legislation in draft form well beforehand makes the job easier and in Elizabeth Gardiner's words ""strengthens the product"". But there are occasions where this is not possible and the challenge her colleagues face - summarised as producing ""clear, coherent"" laws that fit neatly within the existing statute book - rises a notch or two. Brexit is a supreme example of this.While the EU Withdrawal Bill is an ""unprecedented intellectual task"", it may pale into comparison beside the litany of statutory instruments likely to be needed to prepare the UK for life outside the EU and which - unlike most typical secondary legislation - MPs have vowed to scrutinise in detail.Her office is playing a key role working with lawyers across Whitehall as part of a Statutory Instrument Hub, drawing up what could be as many as 900 pieces of individual legislation. ""The secondary legislation that is to be required for Brexit is obviously going to be a significant challenge. ""They all have to be drafted. We have taken on some of the drafting, which is unusual for us, but... we can add quite a bit of value by intervening in some things.""While the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is a relatively tranquil corner of Whitehall, there has been something of a quiet revolution going on in the past decade.Flexible working is the norm - helping to ensure a 50-50 gender balance among the team - drafting guidelines are now available for everyone to read online, amendments are tabled by the press of a button not hand delivered to Parliament, and the office - since 2015 - is run by a woman for the first time.The mother-of-two didn't have a ""burning ambition"" to take the helm but is not unaware of having added another chink in Whitehall's glass ceiling.""I am the 24th [first parliamentary counsel], and there are 23 pictures of men on the wall.""I am proud to have got the job, but I realise that it means quite a lot to other people that there is a woman in the role. ""I don't see myself as a role model, but I have to step into that role a bit because it is important to people in the organisation that there are women in senior positions."""
2018-02-28,Dividing line,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43197428,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwo things can be true at the same time.It is true that Jeremy Corbyn has not dramatically shifted Labour's Brexit policy.For months the party has been saying that some form of customs union with the European Union after Brexit is a possibility.The party's tip toes towards this policy have been long anticipated. And in the last few days his shadow team had given the game away in terms of the party's firmer backing for this idea.The notion of a customs union will be welcomed by businesses who want to minimise the disruption of Brexit - and the idea would go some way towards solving the problem of the Irish border, which as we've discussed many times is one of the tensions in the government's position.This speech, and this policy move, is no Remainiac dream. Jeremy Corbyn has not suddenly become a convert to staying in the single market, nor for a second referendum.The Labour leader has stopped short of where many of his MPs would like him to go, and are already calling for publicly - full backing for the UK to stay in the single market.And it is also the case that it is extremely likely that the European Union would say a hypothetical 'no' to what he is asking for: a say in future trade deals alongside this new proposed customs arrangement.Mr Corbyn also said in his speech that a Labour government would ""not countenance a deal that left Britain as a passive recipient of rules decided elsewhere by others"".So, if the EU says we can't have a say in a customs union, and Mr Corbyn says he wouldn't join a union if the UK wasn't given a say, what happens then? Nothing about what outwardly seems a softer Brexit is guaranteed. If the promise is an impossible one, is it really a promise at all?What is, however, also true is that as the government and Parliament wrangles over Brexit, this new position on customs does give Labour a clear dividing line with the Tories - yes, one of those old chestnuts.That might rile Brexit-backing Labour voters, and worries some MPs.And it does make a potential defeat in the Commons when the Trade and Customs Bill eventually gets there more likely.Yet there is also nothing certain about that. Yes, there is probably a majority in Parliament for staying in a customs union. But for the government to be beaten on that, or forced to move towards Labour's new position, depends on the will of Tory Remainer rebels being ready to take a course of action that could damage the government.Jeremy Corbyn can today pave the way, but he can't be sure they will take the bait."
2018-02-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20180228180710/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union. It is scheduled to depart at 11pm UK time  on Friday 29 March, 2019. The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now moving on to future relations - and a plan for a two year ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations.Both the UK and the EU are keen on the idea of there being a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. The EU wants the transition period - during which they think things should continue pretty much as they do now - to last until 31 December 2020.  The UK wants a slightly longer period of ""about two years,"" or ""as long as it takes"" to set up new systems. Free movement looks set to continue during that period and the UK may have to abide by new laws from Brussels, without any input in how they are created. A final agreement has yet to be reached, however.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU will start if and when the transitional phase has been agreed. Both sides hope that can be done in March, to allow six months of talks to agree the outline of future relations on things like trade, travel and security. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all.  Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide, but first let's go back to the basics...It is a word that used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She is to set out her latest thinking on kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU in a speech on Friday.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had been due in 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - but it has now regained its losses against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations. The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017. Inflation has risen since June 2016 to stand at 3% but unemployment has continued to fall, to stand near a 40-year year low of 4.4%. Annual house price increases have fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 but were still at an inflation-beating 5.2% in the year to December 2017, according to official ONS figures. They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They are now discussing the terms of the ""transition"" period.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together are more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May is seeking to put it into British law.The Conservative government has introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament. If passed, it will end the primacy of EU law in the UK. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, is supposed to incorporate all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The government is facing claims from Remain supporting MPs that it is giving itself sweeping powers to change legislation without proper Parliamentary scrutiny. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. He also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said continued membership of the single market has to be an option in negotiations with Brussels.   Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The single market is a very different beast - it is not just about the trade in goods. It allows the free movement of people, money and services as if the EU was a single country.Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three are each playing roles in negotiations with the EU and seek out new international agreements, although Mrs May, as prime minister will play the key role.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But there is currently uncertainty about how final the break will be on that day - the UK government wants a transition period of around two years to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border check for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a full explanation of what 'no deal' could meanAn agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement.The full details are not yet known but UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72.We don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pounds buy fewer euros. A slump in the value of the dollar means the exchange rate with the pound is pretty close to where it was before the referendum.A fall in the pound means exports should get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 3%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?It seems unlikely. Theresa May has ruled out another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. Labour's leaders have also spoken out against the idea, preferring the idea of a general election being called rather than another referendum. Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could block the exit deal between the UK and EU - so the UK would be leaving without a deal - unless the two sides agreed to halt the whole Brexit process.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. Ms Sturgeon has officially asked for permission for a second referendum to be held. She had wanted the vote to be held between the autumn of 2018 and spring 2019, but after losing seats at the 2017 general election she has put her plans on hold with no referendum likely until 2021. Theresa May has said a second referendum should not be held during the Brexit process.The land border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland has been a key part of the Brexit talks. There is currently a common travel area between the UK and the Republic. Like Scotland, Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. The result in Northern Ireland was 56% for Remain and 44% for Leave.Both sides in the Brexit talks agree that they do not want a return to a ""hard border"" - that means no physical infrastructure, such as customs posts or a network of surveillance cameras. But the wording to agree on this proved tricky and there are still many questions to be answered about how it would work in practice. It remains a stumbling block in Brexit talks.The draft UK-EU agreement in December 2017 said that the UK ""will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 Agreement'. The EU has translated this into a draft legal document, setting out its interpretation of what was agreed.The document proposes a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found. Mrs May says this would threaten the ""constitutional integrity"" of the United Kingdom and lead to a border in the middle of the Irish sea, something no British prime minister could ever accept.May: UK cannot agree to EU Brexit draftThe BBC's Chris Morris outlines the Brexit deal wording on the Northern Ireland borderThere is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.There have been no official estimates published of the size of the bill, which covers things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.A method for calculating the bill has been agreed, but the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The question of how and when payments will be made still needs to resolved, but it will be a schedule lasting for many years to come, and it is highly unlikely that anyone will ever be able to give an exact figure for the size of the divorce bill.UK sources say it will be up to £40bn, but some EU sources expect it to be higher than that. No-one can say for sure, and both sides want to keep it that way.The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But the UK government has not ruled out remaining under its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019.After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The initial stages of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan Rippington's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""So far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 6.5% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017, according to the Halifax. It said the slowdown was driven by a squeeze on real wage growth.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, fear it will shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. At the moment this debate appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it is now seen as unlikely to be agreed - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it will not be part of TTIP and will have to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned. EU citizens working for the NHS are expected to get the right to stay in the UK, although details on EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens elsewhere in the EU are yet to be finalised (see earlier answer).The short answer is there is no easy access to benefits. As it stands at the moment, Brexit aside, you will have to pass what's known as a habitual residence test which was introduced in 1994 and applies to British citizens just as EU citizens. The rules have been tightened up which means for some benefits, if you have been out of the country you can't even think about applying for the test for several months. For example, when it comes to jobseeker's allowance, you cannot even take the test to apply for those benefits for three months. And that was done to stop EU citizens coming here and just getting on benefits straight away. After three months, you can take the test which looks at your English language skills, what sort of efforts you made to find work before coming to the UK. It also considers how strong a tie you have to the UK, whether you have property or family here and what your intentions are in terms of staying and working, or returning. But once you have taken the test, if you pass it then you should be eligible to apply for a range of benefits, as long as you meet the usual requirements in terms of income and showing you are looking for work. That is likely to continue when we move fully on to Universal Credit. The one unknown in the whole system is what happens with Brexit negotiations, in terms of guaranteeing the rights of British nationals abroad. And we simply don't know what that will involve and whether in any way that might impact on how soon you can apply for benefits when you come back to Britain. At the moment UK passports carry the words European Union and British driving licences have the blue square with yellow flags of the EU. That will change after Brexit but it seems likely that the change will be phased in so that you'll simply get documents with the new design when the old ones expire.The right to use them freely is an interesting question. When we talk about restrictions on freedom of movement we generally mean the freedom to live and work in another country. If Britain poses restrictions on the EU in that respect then it can expect some kind of response.But in terms of tourism there are plenty of non-EU countries whose citizens can visit the UK for up to 90 days without a visa. And, as part of the Brexit negotiations, you'd expect similar arrangements to be discussed for the UK. Both sides need each others' tourists and, after all, if you can drive a car in the United States on a UK licence then it doesn't seem fanciful to assume that you'll be able to do the same in Europe in future.The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.There are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.The question of what is going to happen to borders after Brexit is one of the most difficult of the lot.Since 1985 when Spain joined the EU, it has basically been prevented from closing the border with Gibraltar as a way of applying pressure to the British territory.In fact, 12,000 Spanish people cross into the territory to work every day and the area of Spain around Gibraltar is a pretty depressed area so they are important jobs.On the other hand, the Spanish have talked openly about this being an opportunity to get Gibraltar back. Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, its minister of foreign affairs, said the UK's vote to leave the EU was ""a unique historical opportunity in more than three hundred years to get Gibraltar back"".But at a minimum, as things stand, it looks to me as though they could certainly re-impose border controls if they chose to.The situation with Ireland's border is more complex.The total disappearance of military check points on the border is one of the most tangible daily reminders of the end of the Troubles and no one wants a border like that back.But, when the day comes when Ireland is in the EU and the UK is not, then the Irish border of course is also going to be the UK's land border with the European Union.The EU and the UK have both said they don't want to see a return to the borders of the past - but how that will be achieved is still far from certain.And if the UK wants to stop Polish or Romanian migrant workers using Dublin airport as a back door into the UK, then it is going to have to do something about that too. The UK has published a paper setting out its preferred options.Of course, what it will all mean for towns and villages like Belleek and Belcoo in County Fermanagh, which more or less straddle the border, is hard to imagine.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.If you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol.After Brexit, the UK travel document will no longer be required to conform to EU standards. So in what the government describes as a move to symbolise our national identity, the cover will be changing from the standard EU burgundy colour to a blue and gold design.New blue and gold passports will be issued from October 2019, to those renewing or applying for a new passport.The BBC's Reality Check team answered some of your questions about Theresa May's plans for EU citizens living in the UK.Will Irish citizens be exempt from this five-year residency requirement, and continue to be afforded equal treatment with UK nationals?Yes, Irish citizens residing in the UK will not need to apply for settled status to protect their entitlements as the UK government is committed to protecting the Common Travel Area arrangements.Would EU citizens still be able to move to the UK in the next two years until March 2019?Yes, they would. The UK is a member of the EU until it withdraws, so the freedom of movement rules will apply until then.Why shouldn't British courts have full jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK? Wasn't that the whole point of Brexit?The UK government says the European Court of Justice will not have jurisdiction over EU citizens' rights. The EU demands that it does. This is an important sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.How can a lifetime stay be guaranteed? Could a future government change the law?Once the UK leaves the EU, any future government will in principle be able to propose amendments to the rules and the UK Parliament would decide on the new law.I plan to retire to France within the next two years and buy a property. Will this be possible after Brexit?You can buy property and retire anywhere in the world, subject to the rules of the country you are retiring in. So, you'll be able to do that but we don't know what your exact rights will be until the UK and EU sign off on their citizens' rights agreement.I'm an EU national living in the UK but my wife is from outside the EU. Is her status going to change?Your wife, as a family member of an eligible EU citizen who has been resident in the UK before we leave the EU, will also be eligible to apply for settled status with you, provided that she too meets the settlement criteria and has been in a genuine relationship with you while resident in the UK."

This conference cemented Mr Corbyn's dominance of the party, following his better-than-expected general election result. There was a row about Brexit, with moderate MPs, who want Mr Corbyn to commit to keeping the UK in the single market and customs union, feeling they had been denied a vote on this issue and the chance to debate it more fully.And Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell caused a stir when he warned Labour must prepare for all eventualities in government, including a possible run on the pound.

He called for more public input into the funding of services, locally controlled energy schemes and bank investment in ""community bonds"". Leanne Wood vowed to stay on as leader of Plaid Cymru at the party's conference. She told the conference they needed to earn the trust of non-Plaid Cymru voters whilst announcing the party could back a second Brexit referendum if there was no deal with the EU by March 2019.Ms Wood also announced proposals to re-train manual workers whose jobs are threatened by automation and promised a ""rail revolution"". The party saw a drop in their share of the vote in June's general election, although they gained a seat. Meanwhile Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy, who was suspended from the party following a row over policy on council house sales, dismissed suggestions he was planning a leadership challenge at a fringe meeting."
