2018-11-01,Minister quits over bet crackdown 'delay',https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46057548,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSports minister Tracey Crouch has resigned over ""delays"" to a crackdown on maximum stakes for fixed-odds betting machines.Chancellor Philip Hammond said in Monday's Budget that the cut in stakes from £100 to £2 would come into force in October 2019.Ms Crouch said pushing back the date was ""unjustifiable"" and it could cost the lives of problem gamblers.She tweeted: ""Politicians come and go but principles stay with us forever.""Prime Minister Theresa May said she was disappointed Ms Crouch had resigned but there had been ""no delay in bringing forward this important measure"".The government has denied Labour claims that MPs had been led to believe the cut would come into force at the start of the next tax year, in April 2019. They suggested the cut had been intended to be introduced in April 2020.But in her resignation letter, Ms Crouch said:  ""Unfortunately, implementation of these changes are now being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests.""From the time of the announcement to reduce stakes and its implementation, over £1.6bn will be lost on these machines.""In addition, two people will tragically take their lives every day due to gambling-related problems and, for that reason as much as any other, I believe this delay is unjustifiable.""She added: ""It is a fact of government that ministers must adhere to collective responsibility and cannot disagree with policy, let alone when it is policy made against your wishes relating to your own portfolio.""Among those praising her on social media, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted that she was ""principled and courageous"" adding: ""May God bless her commitment to doing right.""Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson tweeted that she ""deserves huge credit not just for her campaign but for sticking up for her principles"". Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government. Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems. But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing.In her response to Ms Crouch, the PM said the government had listened to those who wanted the changes to come into effect sooner than April 2020 and ""had agreed that the changes should be in place within the year - by October 2019"".In his Budget on Monday, the chancellor said the change to fixed-odds stakes would come into force next October at the same time as changes to duty charged on gambling firms based abroad but operating in the UK.The government says co-ordinating the date of the two changes would mean the government would not be hit by a fall in tax revenue.But in the Commons on Thursday, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson accused the government of ""capitulating to the gambling industry"".He praised Ms Crouch's ""courageous and principled decision"" and said Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright ""should be thoroughly ashamed"" of prioritising ""corporate interests over victims, profits over public health and greed over good"".MPs from all sides of the House joined in his criticism. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said it should be discussed as part of the Finance Bill later this month.Week ahead in Parliament: The Finance BillHe told the BBC: ""There are plenty of people whose lives have been damaged by this addiction... We need to do this very quickly, as quickly as we can and in the meantime, the gambling industry will make about £1bn as a result of this delay. That's not right."" Labour has told the BBC that they will put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to try and bring in the changes next April."
2018-11-01,Police probe Banks's Brexit vote spending,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46056337,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe National Crime Agency is investigating Arron Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed at the 2016 EU referendum.Mr Banks and another senior campaign figure, Liz Bilney, were referred to the agency by the Electoral Commission.The watchdog said it suspected Mr Banks was not the ""true source"" of loans to the campaign and the money had come ""from impermissible sources"". Mr Banks denied any wrongdoing and said he welcomed the police investigation.He said he was ""confident that a full and frank investigation will finally put an end to the ludicrous allegations levelled against me and my colleagues"". ""There is no evidence of any wrongdoing from the companies I own. I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations. The Electoral Commission has produced no evidence to the contrary,"" he added in a statement.He claimed the Electoral Commission had acted ""under intense political pressure from anti-Brexit supporters"".Mr Banks is currently in Bermuda, from where he tweeted a picture of himself following the news of the police investigation.Gone fishing ! pic.twitter.com/KPUwpl1DWIEnd of Twitter post  by @Arron_banksSome Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the inquiry.SNP MP Kirsty Blackman told the BBC's Politics Live programme: ""If people are found to be breaking electoral law, then I think there is an issue that you look at the possible validity of the results.""But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said public trust in the source of political donations was ""bigger than Brexit"".""I don't think there is a natural connection to this and calling for a re-run of the referendum. I would rather we focus our resources on holding Mr Banks to account,"" he told BBC News.Under UK law, loans and donations to registered campaigners can only come from permissible sources, which essentially excludes overseas or foreign funding. The law was introduced by the Labour government in 2000 after a series of scandals involving overseas donors accused of trying to influence British laws and elections.Leave.EU's chief executive Liz Bilney said all of the money had come from Mr Banks and he was the ""ultimate beneficial owner"" of the companies that had loaned it.As a UK domiciled taxpayer Mr Banks was ""completely permissible to donate money to campaigns as he sees fit"", she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme.She denied claims the money had come from Russian sources, saying: ""I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don't have any transactions that are from Russia.""And she said the Electoral Commission had ""failed to understand the nature of the loan agreements"" and were seeing them through ""their own biased lens"".""I am confident that all the matters will be completely resolved and I will be exonerated and so will Arron and everybody else involved,"" she added.The Electoral Commission investigation focused on £2m reported to have been loaned to Better for the Country, which ran Leave.EU, by Mr Banks and his group of insurance companies.It also examined a further £6m reported to have been given to the organisation, on behalf of Leave.EU, by Mr Banks alone.The commission's legal chief, Bob Posner, said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect money given to Better for the Country came from impermissible sources and that Mr Banks and Ms Bilney, the responsible person for Leave.EU, knowingly concealed the true circumstances under which this money was provided. ""This is significant because at least £2.9m of this money was used to fund referendum spending and donations during the regulated period of the EU referendum.""Our investigation has unveiled evidence that suggests criminal offences have been committed which fall beyond the remit of the commission. ""This is why we have handed our evidence to the NCA to allow them to investigate and take any appropriate law enforcement action. This is now a criminal investigation.""He said the financial transactions investigated by the commission included companies incorporated in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man, which were ""beyond the reach"" of the watchdog.The National Crime Agency, which is able to investigate across international borders, said electoral law offences would ""not routinely fall"" within its remit.But it added: ""The nature of the necessary inquiries and the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance.""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail.""Leave.EU was a separate campaign to the official Vote Leave organisation.The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU. This departure is due to happen on 29 March 2019."
2018-11-01,Labour MPs rebel to oppose tax cut plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46067196,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTwenty Labour MPs have rebelled against the party leadership to vote against the government's changes to income tax.Yvette Cooper, Stella Creasy, David Lammy and Lucy Powell were among those who defied an instruction from Labour's leadership to abstain on the vote.Many had expressed concern about backing a package which raised the higher rate tax threshold - while freezing working age benefits.MPs approved the Budget proposal by 314 votes to 31, majority 283.Chancellor Philip Hammond announced this week the personal allowance would rise from £11,850 to £12,500 and the higher rate income tax threshold from £46,350 to £50,000 from April 2019.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC on Tuesday: ""We will support the tax cuts at the moment on the basis that it will inject some demand into the economy."" He said a Labour government would focus instead on a ""fairer taxation system"" asking the richest 5% to pay more and rolling back cuts to corporation tax cuts.But a number of Labour MPs have said the party should oppose the income tax changes, because they argue they disproportionately benefit the better-off.In Thursday's debate, 20 Labour MPs voted against the tax changes, in defiance of the party leadership: Karen Buck, Yvette Cooper, Neil Coyle, Stella Creasy, Mike Gapes, Roger Godsiff, Kate Green, Margaret Hodge, Helen Jones, Liz Kendal, David Lammy, Pat McFadden, Alison McGovern, Ian Murray, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell, Emma Reynolds, Gareth Snell and Martin Whitfield.Former cabinet minister Ms Cooper criticised the government, saying: ""They're going ahead with over £1bn in real cuts to tax credits and benefits this coming year for the poorest families.""At the same time they are choosing to spend about the same amount of money on tax cuts for higher rate taxpayers, including those on more than £100,000 a year.""A lone parent with a four-year-old working part-time could end up being nearly £3,000 worse off whereas the high earners end up being over £1,000 better off.""SNP work and pensions spokesman Neil Gray accused the chancellor of having brought in a tax cut which ""disproportionately benefits higher earners the most"" instead of stopping the benefit freeze.For the government, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said it was a shame Mr McDonnell's party did not agree with him and joked to the shadow chancellor there was ""space for you on our frontbench"".

2018-11-01,UK's battle with Apple over EU citizens app,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up computer terminals at 56 local libraries around the UK to help those without smartphones, or without the necessary digital skills, to apply to stay in the UK.But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."
2018-11-01,DUP 'under no illusions' over SoS meeting,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46061166,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA DUP MLA has said the party was under no illusions about the purpose of a briefing at Stormont, despite criticism by three party leaders.Christopher Stalford was speaking after all five parties met with Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described it as ""a waste of time"" while UUP leader Robin Swann said it was box ticking.Relations between the parties and Mrs Bradley were ""possibly at an all-time low"", said Alliance leader Naomi Long.Northern Ireland has been without a government since it collapsed in January 2017.The latest talks process aimed at restoring devolved government fell apart in February.Mr Stalford, who attended the meeting along with DUP party colleague Peter Weir, was asked about some of the criticism the other parties levelled at Karen Bradley.""It's not for Karen Bradley or anyone else to encourage Sinn Féin out of their corner,"" he said.He added that the briefing document that set out how the legislation passed at Westminster was not ideal, but there was no alternative. Thursday's meeting was described as an all-party briefing with a view to restarting the talks process.However, three of the party leaders strongly criticised it when speaking to reporters at Stormont.It is understood the parties were presented with a document that suggested early 2019 as the earliest date for starting a new talks process.Naomi Long said that was ""unacceptable"".Several of the parties also reiterated their call for an external, independent mediator to be appointed to chair the process, but the Ulster Unionist Party said that would not solve the problems between the DUP and Sinn Féin.Ms Long said Karen Bradley was ""putting barriers in the way of restoration"" by ""demanding there is consensus, all-party agreement on the format of the talks"".""This is absolute nonsense,"" she said. ""The secretary of state has already taken the views of all parties regarding how talks should be structured, the responsibility now lies with her to make a decision to convene the talks and to get us back in the room.""By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterIf the phrase things always get worse before they get better rings true, then today at Stormont was a perfect example of that.The language used by the parties during their press conferences in the Great Hall was more negative and critical than we've heard for a long, long time. One talks source said they threw their briefing paper from the NIO into the bin - that tells you just how much they thought of it.As the weather turns colder, relations between the parties seem to have gone into deep freeze too.But can Karen Bradley do anything to hit the defrost button?SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the meeting was a ""waste of time"" and signalled an ""embarrassing day"" for Karen Bradley.""I think I probably should have stayed in Derry,"" he said.""The secretary of state says she needs to see consensus for what a talks process will even look like,"" he added. ""Well, that's not how it works.""How it works is the two governments, when this process fails, step in, they agree a talks process, they make it time bound, they have an independent chair and they have a threat at the end of it that if the parties do not come to an agreement, then they will implement the changes that are required to get us back to government."" Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the meeting was ""badly advised"".""To be honest, it was simply so someone in the NIO (Northern Ireland Office) can tick a box so they can say they brought all five parties around the table,"" he added.He said that the parties received a briefing on the ""bill that was through Westminster that everyone's already read"". Mr Swann also accused Sinn Féin of complete belligerence that ""questions their validity as to whether they want to be part of a meaningful talks process"".He added that an independent chair would not solve the differences between the DUP and Sinn Féin.""An external mediator doesn't bring together the five parties, only the government can do that. ""The government needs to establish a talks process that the five parties are involved in. ""And we can't wait on five-party consensus as to what that talks process looks like because, as I said this morning, all five parties couldn't actually agree what that meeting was or what it should be called.""Sinn Féin said there was no basis for moving forward following the meeting.John O'Dowd and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they attended a meeting to see if power sharing could be re-established but that it was ""clear"" the British government was ""still treating large sections"" of Northern Ireland with contempt. They refused to answer any questions from the media."
2018-11-01,Focus on crime not misogyny - police chief,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46053069,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPolice should focus on burglary and violent crime and not incidents such as misogyny where no offence has been committed, a senior officer has said. Chief Constable Sara Thornton said forces were too stretched to deal with ""deserving"" issues, such as logging hate incidents against women.Claims against dead people were also taking resources from tackling ""today's crime today"", she told a conference.She called for a ""refocus on core policing"".Speaking to police chiefs and police and crime commissioners, Ms Thornton expressed concern about a review into whether misogyny should be treated as a hate crime.Misogyny is the hatred, dislike or prejudice against women.Ms Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said that while ""treating misogyny as a hate crime is a concern for some well-organised campaigning organisations"", forces ""do not have the resources to do everything"".She added: ""I want us to solve more burglaries and bear down on violence before we make more records of incidents that are not crimes"", adding she hoped the review ""takes account of the pressure on forces before suggesting the law is changed"".Ms Thornton, the former head of Thames Valley Police, highlighted Home Office statistics published last week that showed arrests in England and Wales have halved in the last decade.She told the conference: ""We are asked to provide more and more bespoke services that are all desirable - but the simple fact is there are too many desirable and deserving issues.""She added: ""Neither investigating gender-based hate crime or investigating allegations against those who have died are necessarily bad things - I just argue that they cannot be priorities for a service that is over-stretched.""  But Sue Fish, the former chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, which has been reporting incidents of misogyny as a hate crime for the past two years, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One that Ms Thornton's comments were ""shameful"".She said: ""We're reinforcing that women are not worthy or any sort of service from the police,"" she said, adding that historically, police treatment of female victims of rape and domestic violence had been ""appalling"". Since 2010 police chiefs say funding in England and Wales has decreased, in real terms, by nearly a fifth, and there are 20,000 fewer officers.Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, said Ms Thornton's intervention comes as the government seeks to improve the investigation and reporting of hate crimes.""She's trying to send a message back to government, saying, 'look you're trying to get us to do more and more, well how on earth are we supposed to do all of this and also focus on the core activities,'"" he said. Security minister Ben Wallace said police should prioritise resources based on the level of harm caused by a crime, and forces were free to make these decisions as they saw fit.He added that hate crimes were still important and in some cases could spark other problems such as exploitation and community friction.Speaking at the conference, Home Secretary Sajid Javid acknowledged police were ""feeling stretched"" but promised forces would have the resources they needed by 2019-2020.But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said forces could not do ""more with less"".Police should not have to ""pick and choose"" between crimes, and if misogyny was made a hate crime the government must provide the funding to tackle it, she added.

2018-11-01,Smooth Brexit 'could push rates higher',https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46060460,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Bank of England has indicated there could be a faster pace of interest rate increases if the UK manages a smooth exit from the European Union.Although the Bank kept rates unchanged at 0.75% this month, its latest forecasts suggest that rates could rise to 1.5% over the next three years.It said that Brexit uncertainty was preventing some firms from investing.However, Bank governor Mark Carney said a smooth Brexit could see a rebound in that investment.""We do expect a rebound in demand. Business is taking a cautious approach right now as we are at a point of maximum uncertainty, so we have some sense of what is being held back, so we will see a rebound in investment,"" Mr Carney said.Some economists think the Bank might have to be even more aggressive on interest rates. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, believes that if the UK strikes a deal soon, rates could rise three times in 2019.Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics says two rate increases next year ""remain a good bet"".While the Bank sees a Brexit deal as the most likely scenario, in its Quarterly Inflation Report it also warned of damage to business if there was no deal.""An abrupt and disorderly withdrawal could result in delays at borders, disruptions to supply chains, and more rapid and costly shifts in patterns of production, severely impairing the productive capacity of UK business,"" the Bank said.It also thinks the pound would fall and there would be a ""large"" and ""immediate"" fall in economic activity.The Bank's comments came as its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 9-0 to leave rates unchanged at 0.75%.Interest rates were last raised in August as the Bank reacted to stronger data on the economy.The latest decision to keep rates on hold will come as relief to the 3.5 million holders of mortgages that track interest rates, but savers will be disappointed.Szu Ping Chan, BBC economics reporterWith just a few months to go until the UK leaves the European Union, there was a clear message from the Bank of England today. The Brexit deal will determine the next move in interest rates.The Bank expects it to be a smooth one. In this scenario households are expected to keep on spending, with businesses unleashing the money they're currently holding back.But Mr Carney made it clear that if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal, policymakers wouldn't automatically cut rates as they did in the wake of the Brexit vote.Back then, the outlook was uncertain and the UK's exit date was still far away.The no-deal scenario would have a more immediate and permanent impact on prices and the economy, Mr Carney said.So an interest rate cut might not be the appropriate response, although it would still be an option. The Bank's quarterly survey of business leaders indicated that Brexit had become a more important source of uncertainty for them in recent months.As a result, the Bank has slashed its forecast for growth in business investment this year to 0%.However, a smooth Brexit would release that brake on investment, and would come at a time when there is little slack in the economy.In addition, wages are rising, which is supporting consumer spending.All that could force the Bank to raise interest rates to curb inflation.The Bank is forecasting growth of 1.3% this year and 1.7% next year."
2018-11-01,Education spending now 'skewed' to poor,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46046310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere has been a ""remarkable shift"" in poorer children now receiving a bigger share of education spending in England, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The independent financial researchers say in previous generations children from richer families were the main beneficiaries, as they were likely to stay longer in education.But this pattern has been reversed by policies deliberately ""skewed"" to give more funding towards the deprived and with more poorer youngsters going to sixth form and university, it says.The analysis reveals that poorer pupils who took their GCSEs in 2010 had almost £10,000 more spent on them during their school years than their richer counterparts.The following years, up to those leaving university in 2016, have been even more ""pro-poor"" in funding levels, says IFS research fellow, Luke Sibieta.""This is a remarkable shift in the shape of public spending, with an increasing amount of redistribution taking place through public-service spending,"" says Mr Sibieta,The IFS says that back in the 1980s and 1990s, better-off families would have taken the lion's share of public spending on education because their children were much more likely to benefit from continuing beyond the age of 16.This continued into the early 2000s, when the balance began to be shifted by a combination of extra funding aimed at disadvantaged pupils and increasing numbers of poorer families staying on for A-levels and then degrees.For those taking their GCSEs in 2003, there was still an advantage to the wealthy - with £6,000 more being spent on the richest fifth of pupils compared with the poorest.By 2010, policies to support the disadvantaged in school meant that poorer pupils were getting £9,500 more per head in spending.When this was combined with spending on sixth form, college and university, it meant that in 2010 both the richest and poorest had £73,000 spent on their education.The introduction of the pupil premium from 2010 onwards would have shifted the balance further towards supporting the poorest, the IFS says.Going to university has remained more likely among the wealthy, but Mr Sibieta says the public cost of university, even with loans for tuition fees, does not outweigh the overall balance of the poor getting a greater share of spending.This has seen poorer youngsters receiving 20% more spending on average in their school years than the richer pupils.""This was the intended and direct result of reforms to the school funding system over the 2000s,"" says the study.""In less than a decade over the 2000s, education spending shifted from being skewed towards richer pupils to being skewed towards poorer pupils instead,"" says Mr Sibieta.Sir Kevan Collins, chief executive of the Education Endowment Foundation, which researches ways to help disadvantaged pupils to catch up, said: ""The moral and educational case for additional support to underprivileged children remains as strong as ever.""Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely than their classmates to leave school with the qualifications and skills they need to get on in life,"" he said.Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""Unfortunately this only works if there is enough money in the system in total. ""At the moment all children are being short-changed by the government's real-terms cuts to education funding."""
2018-11-01,US attacks UK plan for digital services tax,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46050724,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe US has hit back against a UK plan to impose a new tax on sales by technology giants. US political leaders and business groups say the proposal would violate tax agreements by targeting US firms.They warned the tax could spark US retaliation and hurt prospects for a US-UK trade deal.In a statement on Wednesday, Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas, called the measure ""troubling"".""If the United Kingdom or other countries proceed, that will prompt a review of our US tax and regulatory approach to determine what actions are appropriate to ensure a level playing field in global markets,"" said Mr Brady, who helped shepherd US tax cuts through Congress last year.His statement echoed comments last week by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who voiced ""strong concern"" about different countries' efforts to develop digital sales tax.A slew of business groups - including the US Chamber of Commerce and the US Council for International Business - have also come out against the UK plan.If enacted, the tax measure could ""complicate the United Kingdom's push for deeper US-UK trade relations"", said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council.The UK plan, announced as part of the Budget, would place a 2% tax on sales by large social media platforms, internet marketplaces and search engines from April 2020. In response to Mr Brady's comments, a UK Treasury spokesman said: ""As the chancellor said, this tax is a proportionate and targeted interim response that reflects the changing global economy, and how digital businesses derive value from users - it's not targeted at any country and seeks to ensure the tax system is fair.""It comes as wider efforts to capture more tax from multinational tech giants - which are now typically taxed based on their physical presence in a country - gain steam.The European Commission in March introduced a proposal for a 3% tax on revenues of internet companies with global revenues above €750m (£660m) a year.While some EU member states are opposed, a vote could come before the end of the year. Separately, Spain introduced a digital service measure in its budget that mimics the EU's.Elsewhere, Colombia, Australia and India are among several countries debating new tax measures that target the digital giants, according to the Internet Association, a US trade association with members that include Amazon, Microsoft and Uber.The 36-member OECD has also been discussing the issue, with a report on reforms due in 2020.The slew of measures, after years of discussion, explains the alarm in the US, said Lilian Faulhaber, a law professor at Washington's Georgetown University.""There's a sense in the United States that this digital services tax is becoming more of a real possibility,"" she said. Under President Donald Trump, the US has been supportive of OECD efforts to update the corporate tax system for the global era, said Itai Grinberg, another law professor at Georgetown University.But many in the US - not just the internet giants - have concerns about proposals, like the UK's, that tax turnover, he added.""It's a kind of tax that everyone abandoned half a century ago because it's thought of as very economically inefficient and functions basically like a tariff,"" he said.He said such taxes do little to make the international tax system more fair: ""It's just a pure cash grab"".In announcing the UK tax, UK Chancellor Philip Hammond said progress in global arenas to update tax laws had been ""painfully slow"".But the move has irked some in the US.Josh Kallmer, executive vice president of policy at the Information Technology Industry Council, said the tech industry recognises the need for tax laws to change, but opposes revenue taxes and wants to see the OECD process play out. ""The responses that the UK and EU are poised to take are not helpful,"" he said. ""This is a genuinely global challenge.... Countries have got to coordinate and develop shared principles.""Professor Grinberg said the UK's decision to go it alone gives license to other countries to follow suit, undermining efforts to reach an international solution.The move is particularly risky for the UK, he added, because the logic for taxing tech firms could be extended other industries important to the UK, especially financial services and pharmaceuticals.""I think it will go badly for the UK,"" he said.The US has a range of options should it want to retaliate, in addition to simply making the issue a focus in US-UK trade talks, he added. The US could complain to the WTO. Under US law, the president could also act to raise taxes on UK firms as a retaliatory measure.Professor Faulhaber described the responses being floated as ""nuclear options"".""I don't know how likely they are but I do think they're pretty dramatic,"" she said. ""They... suggest that at least some people in the US see these proposals as fairly dramatic."""

The government, which has published a report into organised crime, will later announce a new strategy and £48m of public money to tackle the gangs.The last figure, published five years ago, showed the cost of such crimes was £24bn.Ms Owens said some of the cost was direct, such as the impact of blackmail on business, but others were indirect, including the impact on the mental health of victims. She described the range of serious crimes that had changed rapidly in volume and complexity over the last five years.""It means children being abused, the vulnerable being trafficked, it means cyber crime,"" she said. ""It means criminal markets that trade drugs, trade firearms, trade in people and make profit as a result.""She added: ""Each year it kills more of our citizens than terrorism, war and natural disasters combined.""Later, minister for Security and Economic Crime, Ben Wallace, will say: ""Many serious and organised criminals think they are above the law.""They think they can defy the British state. And they think they are free to act with impunity against our businesses and our way of life. They are wrong.""Our new strategic approach not only improves our government and law enforcement capabilities, but also ensures the private sector, the public and international partners are integrated as part of our response.""He will also announce £48m to fund the National Economic Crime Centre, training police fraud investigators, and extra data and intelligence capabilities.

2018-11-01,Labour says it would end the welfare freeze,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46050691,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour says it would end the freeze in working-age benefits if it wins the next general election.The policy was not included in the party's last manifesto, but at Prime Minister's Questions, Jeremy Corbyn said he ""would have ended the benefit freeze"" if he had won the election.Labour later said it would increase benefits in line with inflation.Most working-age benefits were frozen in 2016 by former Tory chancellor George Osborne.During the 2017 general election campaign, Labour promised to scrap the so-called bedroom tax, restore housing benefit for those under 21 and increase Personal Independence Payments for the disabled.It did not specifically promise to end the welfare freeze, although shadow chancellor John McDonnell said at the time the freeze would be rendered ""irrelevant"" by Labour's other proposals.By the BBC's Iain WatsonJust before the stroke of midday, you may well have thought that Labour's official policy wasn't to end the freeze on working-age benefits.After all, the 2017 manifesto made no mention of this, though it did suggest other changes to the welfare system.But shortly afterwards, at Prime Ministers Questions, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would have lifted the benefits freeze.At a briefing an hour later, Labour officials argued that while there had been no mention ""in terms"" in the manifesto of ending the freeze, nonetheless this had been the implication of Labour's position all along.Labour party staff subsequently emailed journalists with quotes from the 2017 campaign when Jeremy Corbyn said Labour ""was not going to freeze benefits"". However,  a spokesman clarified that this didn't necessarily mean that benefits would be uprated in line with inflation.Then, at 3:10pm, a Labour spokesman said benefits would indeed be uprated in line with prices.Which is - for now - definitely the unequivocal position..Speaking on ITV's Peston show, Mr McDonnell said: ""We will lift the freeze and we will make sure thereon that people get a proper cost of living increase.""Labour will explain how it would pay for the pledge with a ""costed programme"" ahead of the next general election, he added.It comes with the Labour leadership facing criticism from some of its MPs over its response to Philip Hammond's Budget.Mr McDonnell sparked the row when he said Labour would not be opposing income tax changes which analysts said would mostly benefit the better off.Some MPs said the money spent on the tax cuts could be better used elsewhere, but Mr McDonnell defended himself by saying people like head teachers had had a ""rough time"" in recent years.Labour is expected to vote against the Budget as a whole, but abstain on the tax changes, when MPs are asked to approve the package on Thursday."
2018-11-01,Hopes rise of UK-EU financial service deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46053283,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK has struck a deal with the EU on post-Brexit financial services, according to unconfirmed reports.The Times newspaper said London had agreed in talks with Brussels to give UK financial services firms continued access to the bloc. The pound has risen 1% against the dollar in response.But a government source said that was ""a rather rose-tinted interpretation of where we have got to"".The source told the BBC: ""People shouldn't get ahead of themselves."" The Times said in its report that an initial deal on exchange of data had also been agreed.It added the deal was expected to be completed within three weeks.Sterling rose on hopes of an agreement, with the pound up by more than a cent against the dollar at $1.2887.Britain's departure from the European Union is expected to take place in March next year, but many UK-based businesses have expressed concern over the lack of progress in Brexit talks. Despite various reassurances from Prime Minister Theresa May that definite trade terms between firms in the UK and the EU will be finalised by March next year, businesses across the board are already preparing for the worst.Mrs May's senior adviser on Europe, Oliver Robbins, was continuing the negotiations in Brussels, The Times said. Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenterEquivalence - the apparent basis of Theresa May's reported deal with Brussels on financial services - sounds like a cuddly continuation of what the City has now. It is not.In this context, equivalence is a legal term describing the regime the EU uses when dealing with countries outside its boundaries. The EU grants equivalence to other states if it can be persuaded that its rules are the same as the ones set by Brussels. Equivalence, and the trading rights that come with it, can be withdrawn at any time. That is why when one of the big City law firms, Hogan Lovells, was asked to look at equivalence by the City UK, the trade body for the Square Mile, its conclusion was that it did not ""provide a long-term sustainable solution"".What we do not know, however, is whether Mrs May has managed to negotiate some kind of ""equivalence-plus"",  with the kind of safeguards that would ease City fears. In any event, reports of any kind of deal were enough to rally sterling, and even those unhappy with the idea of equivalence would concede that it is probably better than no deal at all.According to the newspaper's report, the deal means that after Brexit, UK financial services companies will be able to operate within the EU as they do now.The Times said the EU would accept that the UK had ""equivalent"" regulations to Brussels and would therefore be allowed market access.However, there has been no official confirmation of the report.Thomas Moore, investment director of UK equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the BBC's Today programme that if true, ""I think on balance, it's positive.""He said the granting of equivalence, much desired by the City, ""produces much greater certainty, not just for financial companies""."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But other areas of health spending run by the Department of Health will fall in 2019-20, according to a think tank. Government sources indicated that there were other revenues of income to boost Department of Health funding, including immigrant surcharges, which could be spent on services outside NHS England.The Health Foundation think tank has analysed the Budget paperwork and says that while the NHS England budget for day-to-day running costs will rise by nearly £4bn in real terms next year, there will be a reduction of £1bn, or 12%, in other areas of the health budget.This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health. It also includes the budget for Health Education England.The previous Chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training.The Conservative chairwoman of the Health Select Committee, Sarah Wollaston, told the BBC any further cuts would be unacceptable: ""We cannot see money transferred from other parts of the Budget such as public health or training budgets to fund NHS England rises.  ""This would have serious consequences and undermine the commitments made to the NHS this summer.""Labour's Barbara Keeley said it was ""incredibly short-sighted given the workforce challenges in the NHS"".  Others argued that in the long run, it would cost the NHS far more if investment did not go into prevention and early intervention. Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation, said that ministers may have to resort to raiding budgets set aside for investment in NHS buildings and technology.""If the government wants to avoid further cuts to education and public health, it will need to shift all of the planned capital growth to day-to-day resource budgets,"" she said.A government source said that the numbers in the Budget did not include sources of income, including surcharges for immigrants, which could be passed on to areas like public health. In the past, health budgets in England have been propped up with money switched from investment known as capital spending (such as money for new buildings) and it's possible this will happen again next year.The budget for day-to-day running costs for NHS England is £114.6bn for 2018-19, and the equivalent overall budget for the Department of Health is £123.3bn."

Brexit is bound to come up in conversation, so it feels like a good day to remind ourselves what the Norway model is. Since the referendum, Norway has been discussed as one possible Brexit solution because a) it is not a member of the European Union, but b) it is in the European Economic Area (EEA), which means that it's also part of the single market. So it's about as close to the EU as you can get without being a member state. And, if the UK followed this example, that would mean its trade relations with its nearest neighbours could remain pretty much as they are now.  Alphabet soup alert. You have to join EFTA - the European Free Trade Association, which groups four countries together: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.  Just to complicate things further, Switzerland has chosen not to join the EEA, and relies on a series of complex agreements with the EU instead.    It means Norway has full access to the single market, and very limited barriers to trade with the EU.  In return it makes substantial contributions to the EU budget, and has to follow most EU rules and laws.  These include the so-called four freedoms - the freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.   That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in Norway, and Norwegians can live and work across the EU.  But Norway has no formal say in making EU rules, because it has no representation in any of the main European institutions. Norway is not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So it can set its own policies in those areas.   It is also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs.  Yes. That sounds familiar doesn't it?Of course it helps when you have one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world, thanks to huge investments generated by oil and gas revenues.Fishing and agriculture are also big issues in rural Norway (fishing is one of the biggest industries in the country) so being outside the CFP and the CAP are important indicators of national sovereignty. No, it's not.  That means it does need to take some additional administrative steps in order to trade with the EU. But it also means it can sign its own trade deals with other countries around the world. However, being outside the EU customs union means a relationship like Norway's would not solve the thorny Brexit problem of avoiding a hard border in Ireland. To keep the Irish border as open as it is now, you would need to add a new customs union (or equivalent arrangement) with the EU - a ""Norway plus"" solution, if you like.  She has. And she has pledged to leave both the single market and the customs union. Some MPs, though, have recently argued in favour of a short-term 'Norway for Now' option.  Instead of a transition period after Brexit, it would see the UK joining the EEA (via EFTA) for three years, and agreeing a temporary customs union with the EU. That would, the theory goes, give the UK time to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU for the future. Good point.  EEA membership would certainly be on offer as a long-term solution after Brexit. But it's unlikely that Norway and friends would want to be used as a waiting room on the UK's route out of the EU. ""I don't think it's easy to think that you can enter into an organisation you are preparing to leave at the same time,"" Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the Northern Future Forum.""It is also a little bit difficult for the rest of us.""Logistics and the law would pose a problem as well. There is neither time nor legal authority before 29 March 2019 for the UK to apply to join EFTA and then rejoin the EEA.  As things stand, EFTA states are also not allowed to be in a customs union with the EU. In the government's mind it is. Theresa May said in Oslo today that Norway's existing relationship with the EU ""has elements that wouldn't deliver on the vote of the British people.""But these are uncertain times. If a Brexit deal were to be agreed with the EU, and then voted down in the House of Commons, all bets would be off.And all options (including some version of Norway) could be up for debate.

2018-11-01,High Street Budget,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46026119,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window2018 has been an annus horribilis for the High Street. Big names like Toys R Us and Maplin have gone bust, while others like Debenhams and House of Fraser have closed city and town centre sites. Thousands of stores have shut, costing tens of thousands of jobs. Cries to save the High Street have become more shrill with every empty unit.  Many retailers have cried foul in the face of a perfect storm. There has been new competition from online firms that employ fewer staff and pay far lower business rates.  There are two ways you can level the playing field. Cut charges for the traditional retailers or increase them for online traders. Mr Hammond has done a bit of both. As trailed over the weekend, he has spent £900m knocking a third off the business rates bill of 500,000 small retailers. Very welcome to those who have premises with a rateable value below £51,000.Second - he unveiled a new £400m digital services tax to be levied on the tech giants (those with revenues over £500m - here's looking at you Facebook and Google) on the money they make on digital services like advertising and streaming entertainment (but not online sales).So will these two measures save the high street? Probably not - at least not on their own. While some tenants and landlords welcomed today's move, the business rates discount for small retailers would certainly not have saved any of the high profile retail busts this year.Rateable values on prominent High Street sites are usually a lot higher than the £51,000 threshold. Industry body the British Retail Consortium was underwhelmed. Chief executive Helen Dickinson said: ""Rather than tinkering around the edges, struggling high streets require wholesale reform of business rates in order to thrive. The issue remains that the business rates burden is simply too high."" The tax on digital services is a bold step at first sight - going it alone in taxing the very same companies that the UK is trying to woo to invest in the UK. However, it's possible - even likely - that this digital tax will never see the light of day. Its introduction is delayed until 2020 - by which time the OECD group of countries has promised to come up with its own plans to tax the digital economy. The chancellor explicitly said he reserved the right to adopt their proposals if they look like gaining international acceptance. So, while he looks like a trailblazer, he would prefer safety in numbers.That's not to say that the rest of the world isn't serious about figuring out how to tax technology companies - they are, and their proposals may be more aggressive than Philip Hammond's.But it's unlikely that the measures in today's Budget are enough for him to be considered as the saviour of the High Street.

2018-11-01,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-11-01,Labour Party conference,https://web.archive.org//web/20181102000815/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful.Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal.Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to £500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

Met Police chief Cressida Dick told the BBC her officers were assessing online material because it appears ""there may have been a crime committed"". It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media.Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the party should have notified the police itself.""I think they have a duty of care to their members where there are allegations of race hate crimes,"" she told BBC News.""For me as a Jewish Labour MP... there is a feeling of fear about and that is why firm action taken by the police and the party is so important.""LBC handed the dossier to Ms Dick in an interview in September. Before it did so, it showed the material to former Met police officer Mak Chishty, whose view was that 17 instances should have been reported to the police for investigation, and another four were potential race hate crimes.LBC said the allegations included threats against members of Parliament, including a message on Facebook that a female Labour MP was a ""zionist extremist...who hates civilised people"" and is ""about to get a good kicking"".The Met Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her officers were seeking advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and hoped to conclude the investigations quickly.She made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. ""We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves.""However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it. ""We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed.""It is understood Labour has not been contacted by the police and has not been told of the exact nature of the allegations being investigated. A party spokesman said a ""robust system"" was in place for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour rules by its members. ""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way.""Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told Today he was ""not surprised"" by the allegations and anyone engaging in such behaviour must have the ""full force of the law"" applied to them.""If this does one thing, it will silence a small number of people, who still believe that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in my party or in other parties, and that hampers the campaign to try and deal with this problem as quickly and as swiftly and as forcefully as we can,"" he said. In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue.It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech.The party is currently working through a backlog of cases of alleged anti-Semitism complaints against members. But MP Dame Louise Ellman, vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, suggested the party had failed to properly investigate ""potentially very serious"" cases and she hoped, at the very least, Mr Corbyn was aware of the file. ""The disgraceful position Labour is in is continuing,"" she told BBC News. ""I would have thought the people responsible would have learnt their lesson by now. It appears they have not done so.""The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was a ""deeply embedded"" culture of anti-Semitism within parts of Labour.""This comes as no surprise to us,"" said the organisation's vice president Amanda Bowman. ""We have repeatedly set out what Labour needs to do, including taking firm action against anti-Semites and making its opaque processes transparent."""
2018-11-02,Brexit deal 'will not jeopardise UK integrity',https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46065909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity.Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland.He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont.Asked three times if the government had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish Sea ports, he said: ""We are engaged in a negotiation process.""He added that he was not going to engage in a running commentary but said the UK position was ""we want to preserve the internal market within the United Kingdom"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said she made it clear to Mr Raab it is important that ""as well as not having as customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.When asked by BBC News NI if Mr Raab gave that assurance, Mrs Foster said it is ""an ongoing process"".Following her meeting with Mr Raab, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald accused the government of acting ""in bad faith"" over Brexit and warned the border issue is not a ""footnote"".She added that the government has ""stepped back"" from its commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in negotiations.Ms McDonald added that the Sinn Féin meeting with the Brexit secretary was ""direct"".Earlier, Mr Raab was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night"" on his visit to Northern Ireland.He met politicians and business leaders and visited Warrenpoint Port in County Down and Larne Harbour in County Antrim.However, Sinn Féin South Down MP Chris Hazzard protested that the Brexit secretary had refused to meet local politicians.Speaking outside Warrenpoint Port, Mr Hazzard said it was an example of ""the cynicism and disrespect"" being shown to the electorate of South Down and that Mr Raab had come in ""like a thief in the night"" without listening to people and their concerns about leaving the EU.SDLP MLA Sinéad Bradley said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that Mr Raab had not found time to meet local politicians.""I suspect he did not want to hear the voice of the people of the area,"" she said.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in current withdrawal negotiations.Colm Shannon of Newry Chamber of Commerce described Mr Raab's visit to Warrenpoint as ""a welcome opportunity for local businesses to highlight our concerns about the border and future trading relationships with the EU"".""It was a useful visit. He listened to the concerns of local businesses, particularly those that trade north-south,"" he said.  He said an open border and freedom to trade east and west were essential to the continued success of the port.The backstop is an arrangement which will apply if the Irish border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now in the context of a wider deal.DUP speaking after Raab meet.

Let’s hear with DR says later. pic.twitter.com/ZKjhoBW0iBEnd of Twitter post  by @JP_BizThe EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period.A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks.The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"".However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"".November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added.Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks.Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon.Mr Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan hosted a meeting in Dublin on Friday for the latest session of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC).It was the second time in about three months the conference was held, after not being convened for more than a decade.The British government was represented by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.

2018-11-02,Call to ditch 'bonkers' fracking plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071985,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFracking is controversial, this much we know. But the government has ratcheted-up tensions with plans that could see shale gas projects fast-tracked in future. Those tensions were particularly apparent this week at a packed out parliamentary debate. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs lined up to lambast the proposals and call for a rethink. It comes as Cuadrilla announced that it had produced the first natural gas from its site in Lancashire.So what's causing all the consternation? Well, one idea that the government's recently consulted on is whether non-hydraulic shale gas exploration projects should be granted planning permission through ""permitted development rights"".For anyone who's built a kitchen extension or conservatory, it may be a familiar phrase.  Permitted developments, in the government's own words, provide a ""simpler, more certain route to encourage development"".Crucially, that removes the need to put in a planning application to the local council although the relevant licenses and environmental permits would still have to be obtained.Leading this week's Westminster Hall debate, the Conservative MP for Fylde, Mark Menzies, said that the idea was ""nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers"".He described some of the infrastructure and traffic that can surround shale gas sites and asked, ""Who on earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow?""  Fracking was temporarily halted this week at Lancashire's Preston New Road site after a 1.1 magnitude tremor. Shale gas firm Cuadrilla said the tremor was no cause for concern and, now it's seen the first signs of natural gas flowing to the surface, the industry may feel a renewed sense of confidence.It's worth pointing out that the current hydraulic operations there would not have fallen under the government's proposed permitted development scheme. But the tremor has provided fuel for critics of the government's fracking policy. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the government's proposals as a ""subversion"" of local democracy. ""Permitted development was created for conservatories, small extensions and outhouses none of which to the best of my knowledge have ever created an earth tremor,"" he said in the debate. Ministers have also consulted on the planning process for fracking sites should they reach the actual hydraulic production stage. Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract gas or oil by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals, at high pressure, into the earth via drilled boreholes. The water mixture opens up cracks in the rock and the sand lodges into the spaces to keep them open, allowing for the release of gas. The government's proposals, for permitted development, would only apply to non-hydraulic shale gas exploration. This works without the use of fluid pressure but allows companies to drill for core samples. However, many argue that even exploration sites can cause considerable disruption to local communities. The government is looking at whether such applications could be included in something known as the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime or NSIPs. Think major new roads, railway lines and airports. NSIPs typically see a Planning Inspector present a report and recommendations to the relevant Secretary of State. Local councils get to ""inform"" the decision, but they certainly don't get to make it.Given the government's much-trumpeted commitment to ""localism"", the irony has not been lost on Conservative MPs. East Yorkshire's Sir Greg Knight said: ""If the government is being consistent, shouldn't local communities have more say on fracking matters and not have their voice taken away?"" He was one of 10 Tory MPs to express concerns at this week's debate and there are more. Misgivings range from cautious scepticism to outright anger. North East Derbyshire is a marginal seat where a company recently won permission, through appeal, to look for shale gas. The constituency's Conservative MP, Lee Rowley, has described the government's proposals as ""ludicrous"", adding that, ""fracking in my view will not work in this country"". Ministers point to the fact that permitted development rights do contain exclusions and restrictions that can mitigate a development's impact. They also say that NSIPs do see local communities consulted at an early stage while councils can submit written representations during the examination process.  But there has been a hint this week, perhaps, of some political nervousness. On the back of two consultations, that many argued amounted to undermining local democracy, a third consultation has appeared all about ""strengthening community engagement""; specifically whether it should be compulsory for shale gas firms to consult communities at the pre-application stage. Planning Minister Kit Malthouse this week told MPs: ""We believe this could further strengthen the role local people play in the process."" But it's led to claims that the government is now ""all over the place"" on its fracking policy. Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron said: ""This is the most inconsistent, confusing thing that I've seen in all my 35 years in parliament.""The government's determination to explore the potential of fracking is based on the hope that it could deliver greater energy security, jobs and cheaper gas for consumers. There is also some considerable frustration at the sluggish, yet fraught, way in which shale gas applications can currently be processed at a local authority level. Energy minister Claire Perry has previously said it is ""a morass of protest and counter-prevailing information and frankly I pity any local councillor that gets an application on their desk because they will shortly have a travelling circus of protestors most of whom do not hail from the areas where those sites are located.""  Ministers do insist that they remain fully committed to ensuring that local communities are properly involved in any application whilst also ensuring that the process is sped up. However, when it comes to controversial shale gas schemes, there is a real question over whether those two aims can easily be reconciled. And also whether the government can contain the evident displeasure and disquiet amongst some of its own MPs. "
2018-11-02,16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46076119,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt least 16 MPs have received free sports tickets from betting companies since the 2017 general election. A BBC analysis of parliament's register of MPs' interests has revealed that 13% of the £175,580 worth of sports tickets accepted by MPs came from betting companies, including William Hill and Ladbrokes.The analysis comes after Tracey Crouch resigned as sports minister and appeared to criticise politicians who have links to the betting industry.In her letter to Theresa May on Thursday evening, Ms Crouch complained that the reduction in the maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was ""being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests.""    Of the 16 MPs, nine were Labour MPs, six Conservative and one SNP.Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, received free tickets worth a total of £5,759 since the general election. He was hosted at 13 horse racing events by Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Sky Bet, which also offered him free tickets to the 2017 League One play-off between Millwall and Bradford City.Mr Davies, a backbench MP, chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gambling.He has spoken out against restricting FOBTs numerous times in Parliament.For example, in March 2016, he said: ""The inconvenient truth is that problem gambling rates have reduced since the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals.""And in November of the same year:""Can the Minister tell us what the point is of reducing the stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops when people can go straight on to the internet and play exactly the same games with unlimited stakes?""The BBC approached Mr Davies for comment but, so far, hasn't received a response. Speaking to the Times, he denied using his links to encourage the government to change its position: ""I'm flattered anyone thinks I could be so influential"", he said.The second most common guest of betting companies was Conservative MP Laurence Robertson, who received the hospitality of William Hill and Ladbrokes at a cost of £5,175 since the election.On Thursday, during an urgent question tabled by Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson, he criticised the focus on FOBTs, drawing attention to the ""losses that will be suffered on the high street in terms of the jobs of men, women and young people, who will also suffer poverty, and the losses to the horse racing industry.""Mr Robertson has links to the horse racing industry and, when contacted by the BBC, he said ""it would be odd if I didn't visit racecourses in various capacities.""That's because - he pointed out - his constituency of Tewkesbury includes the Cheltenham racecourse and he has been a co-chair of the APPG on racing and bloodstock for 8 years.Mr Robertson has previously defended the industry in parliament. During a Westminster Hall debate on 26 April 2016, he said: ""There are people with addictive natures who will be addicted to something, whether that is alcohol, drugs or gambling, but we are discussing only one form of gambling, and many other forms are available.""Some Conservative MPs have highlighted a series of donations made to Tom Watson by millionaire former poker player Derek Webb, who founded the anti-FOBT Campaign for Fairer Gambling. Mr Watson told the Daily Mail he had been highlighting the issue before he met Mr Webb and was proud to campaign alongside him.Within Labour's ranks, Tonia Antoniazzi topped the list. The MP for Gower received tickets and hospitality worth £1,693 from betting firms - including for boxing and darts.Ms Antoniazzi told the BBC that the darts tickets were to play in a parliamentary charity darts competition. She added that she has been ""a constant supporter of reducing the stake of fixed odds betting terminals.""The BBC's analysis does not cover events attended by government ministers in their official capacity.Out of 235 free sports events attended by MPs since the general election, two of the top three most common donors are betting companies: William Hill totalled 24 gifts at a value of £13,273 and Ladbrokes Coral Group hosted 14.A spokesperson for William Hill said: ""As a business that has sport at its core, and is a major sponsor of sports events including horse racing, we do invite MPs of all parties and views to find out more about the industry."""

But in practice, EU nationals will still be able to come and work in the UK, until the end of the planned 21-month ""transition period"". The only difference is that they will have to register with the authorities.Ms Nokes was questioned at length on Tuesday about what would happen if there was no ""transition period"" - because the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a withdrawal deal - and whether employers would be expected to check if potential staff had the right to work in the UK.Committee chair Yvette Cooper asked how an employer could be expected to differentiate between someone who had arrived in the UK after Brexit - and an EU citizen who had been a long term resident and had the right to work, but had not yet applied for ""settled status"".Ms Nokes admitted it would be ""almost impossible for an employer to differentiate between a new arrival and somebody who has been here for 10 years and has simply not yet been through the scheme"".But she said: ""If somebody has been through the settled status scheme, they will be able to evidence that. If somebody has not been here prior to the end of March next year, then employers will have to make sure that they go through adequately rigorous checks to evidence somebody's right to work.""Her remarks were met with ""deep concern"" from the Federation of Small Businesses, whose chairman Mike Cherry said:  ""The reality is that many of these businesses wouldn't have the first idea of where, or how, to check whether or not their EU staff have the right to work here.""The 3million, which campaigns for the rights of EU citizens in the UK, reported that the Home Office had emailed to confirm current checks ""will not change next March in the event we leave the EU without a deal"".And that ""EU citizens will continue to be able to evidence their right to work by showing a passport or national identity card."" Employers would not be expected to differentiate between ""resident EU citizens and those arriving after exit"".On Friday, the Home Office confirmed that statement and added: ""We will protect EU citizens' rights when we leave the EU, in both a deal or no deal scenario.""We are considering a number of options for the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without a deal, and will set out more information shortly.""Under current rules, employers must carry out ""right to work"" checks on new staff. For British citizens, this means providing a passport or birth certificate and a National Insurance number while EU citizens must provide their passport or ID card and people from outside the EU must provide their biometric residence permit."

Both groups have denied wrongdoing and accused the commission of a politically-motivated attack.On Thursday, the National Crime Agency confirmed it was investigating Leave.EU and its co-founder Arron Banks and chief executive Liz Bilney over separate allegations that it had breached electoral law by accepting loans from ""impermissible sources"".Mr Banks said he welcomed the investigation and was confident it would ""put an end to the ludicrous allegations"".In May, the Commission fined Leave.EU £70,000, saying it had exceeded its spending limit by at least 10% by failing to include at least £77,380 in its spending return. It referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.In July, the elections watchdog fined Vote Leave £61,000 and referred the campaign to the Met, saying it had exceeded its £7m spending limit by funnelling £675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave.The Met has denied reported claims that ""political sensitivities"" had delayed the Met's probe.The force says it was not until 7 September that it received ""over 900 documents"" relating to both referrals from the Electoral Commission.On Friday, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have been passed by the Electoral Commission, on two separate occasions, a huge amount of material.""""They pass us material when they think it may be a matter for the police, there may have been some crime committed and we are assessing that material and we are doing that carefully.""It's just at a scoping stage so it would be wrong for me to say, before we know what we have got properly in the material and what it amounts to, whether there is any criminal investigation there or not. At the moment we are just assessing that and we will do that properly.""Vote Leave said the Electoral Commission's report was ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated, accusing it of basing its conclusions on ""unfounded claims and conspiracy theories"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks has described the Commission's findings as a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would challenge them in court.Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the National Crime Agency inquiry.The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU. This departure is due to happen on 29 March 2019."

He said a Labour government would focus instead on a ""fairer taxation system"" asking the richest 5% to pay more and rolling back cuts to corporation tax cuts.But a number of Labour MPs have said the party should oppose the income tax changes, because they argue they disproportionately benefit the better-off.In Thursday's debate, 20 Labour MPs voted against the tax changes, in defiance of the party leadership: Karen Buck, Yvette Cooper, Neil Coyle, Stella Creasy, Mike Gapes, Roger Godsiff, Kate Green, Margaret Hodge, Helen Jones, Liz Kendal, David Lammy, Pat McFadden, Alison McGovern, Ian Murray, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell, Emma Reynolds, Gareth Snell and Martin Whitfield.Former cabinet minister Ms Cooper criticised the government, saying: ""They're going ahead with over £1bn in real cuts to tax credits and benefits this coming year for the poorest families.""At the same time they are choosing to spend about the same amount of money on tax cuts for higher rate taxpayers, including those on more than £100,000 a year.""A lone parent with a four-year-old working part-time could end up being nearly £3,000 worse off whereas the high earners end up being over £1,000 better off.""SNP work and pensions spokesman Neil Gray accused the chancellor of having brought in a tax cut which ""disproportionately benefits higher earners the most"" instead of stopping the benefit freeze.For the government, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said it was a shame Mr McDonnell's party did not agree with him and joked to the shadow chancellor there was ""space for you on our frontbench"".

The Guido Fawkes website said one in four of its staff may leave and all had been offered voluntary redundancy.The party, which has struggled since its disastrous 2015 general election, said its priority was winning votes and seats at the next election.The Lib Dems have seen a boost in membership since the 2016 EU referendum, but have struggled to attract attention in the Brexit debate, despite being the main party campaigning for another referendum, and they continue to languish in the opinion polls.Sir Vince, who was a cabinet minister in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government between 2010 and 2015, has said he will step down once Brexit ""is resolved or stopped"".He has also said he wants to make progress on proposed reforms aimed at turning the party into a mass movement - which could see supporters become members for free and non-MPs stand to be leader.According to its 2017 accounts, 68 staff work at the party's headquarters, led by chief executive Sir Nick Harvey, the former MP and minister. The party incurred a deficit in its finances of more than £700,000 in 2017 - due to increased spending on the general election campaign, which saw an increase in MPs from eight to 12 but a fall in overall vote share. Sir Vince said the ""adjustment"" in staffing was a product of the political climate. ""We've been campaigning on Brexit, our resources have been going into that and some of the general activities have been cut back,"" he said.""It doesn't affect our effectiveness as a political movement although obviously it's difficult for the individuals if we're having to scale back and there are fewer jobs.""The Lib Dems have always struggled to compete financially with the Conservatives and Labour, which get much of their funding from business and the unions respectively. The party received £6.1m in donations in 2017 and got £1.2m from membership income. In recent years, the party has scaled back its autumn conference from five to four days and said its spring gathering needs to become more ""cost-effective"".In a statement, a spokeswoman said: ""We are in the process of carrying out a reorganisation which will see a reduction in the number of staff at our headquarters. ""We are focussing our resources to carry on leading the fight against Brexit and taking on power and privilege to build a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.""The party's former leader Nick Clegg, who lost his seat in last year's election, announced he had been hired by Facebook as its head of global affairs."

Downing Street said it expected the Home Office to respond to the ""difficult and important"" issues raised in the report but the prime minister did not believe civil servants were acting against ministers. The Windrush controversy began when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly declared illegal immigrants.Ms Rudd came under fire for the government's treatment of these residents - known as the Windrush generation - and their relatives and the wider impact of its ""hostile environment"" policy designed to deter illegal immigration.When she addressed MPs on the home affairs select committee on 25 April, Ms Rudd gave an inaccurate assertion that her department had no targets for immigration removals. She blamed officials, and the report - written in May - describes a series of confused email exchanges and crossed wires. Ms Rudd later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but told the Commons she had not been aware of them. This was subsequently contradicted by a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. While Sir Alex does not recommend any civil servant face a misconduct investigation, he singles out for criticism the then director general for immigration enforcement Hugh Ind, who has since moved to a different civil service role. The report said he had offered a ""less than satisfactory performance"".Ms Rudd said the report demonstrated that immigration enforcement ""did not have a grip on what was going on"".She added she hoped changes would be made as a result of the report ""so that people get a better service"".The Hastings and Rye MP stopped short of saying she felt vindicated by the report, but hinted she was ready to return to front line politics.She said whether or not she returned to high office was now ""up to the prime minister"".Speaking to the BBC last month about her career, Ms Rudd said she been misled by some civil servants about immigration enforcement.Ms Rudd told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast she should have done more to find out what was happening but when she started ""really probing... it became evident that [officials] didn't know what was going on.""She said it had made her more sceptical about civil servants - although she praised those she worked with on counter-terrorism as ""fantastic"".She added she would ""quite like"" to be home secretary again ""because there's a few things I'd like to do a bit better than last time""."

The survey of 113 male and female MPs and focus groups of politically-active women revealed the culture at Westminster remains very male-dominated. A female activist said: ""It feels like the system is created by men for men."" Research showed that, despite growing numbers of women getting involved and a commitment to increase women's representation, political institutions are still highly ""masculinised"", and this remained a particular deterrent for potential female candidates.  The times, locations and set-up of meetings meant a lot of women said they had to bring their children along with them to events and meetings, the survey found. This unaccommodating working environment means that some female candidates struggle to balance childcare and political activism. ""When I've taken my kids along to meetings I've been told 'can your boys sit at the back?'. It was not a really important meeting. Why were my children sent to the back of the room? It's like it's not appropriate to have children in the room,"" a female MP said. The main parties at Westminster all say they are committed to increasing the number of female MPs and the report says progress has been made in making politics more female and family-friendly.But some parties had made more progress than others.In February 2018, 45% of Labour MPs were women, followed by the SNP on 34% , the Lib Dems 33% and the Conservatives on 21%. Women are also under-represented in local government, which serves as a key step into Parliament, with only 33% of local authority seats held by them in 2017.Some of the devolved assemblies and Parliaments perform better on women's representation than Westminster, the report said. But the UK currently ranks 41st in the Inter-Parliamentary Union's table of Women in Parliament.Black, Asian and minority ethnic women face further obstacles compared with their peers, the Fawcett Society said.After the 2017 general election, black and minority ethnic women (BME) made up only 4% of MPs - and those who did make it to the green benches can find Parliament a challenging place to work, the report says. ""I do think it's intimidating if you are a BME woman who isn't very used to kind of establishment places, to come into a room where there's a lot of old white middle-class men,"" said a BME female MP. Black and minority ethnic women also faced ""much higher levels of abuse"" than their white and male counterparts when campaigning in public places, the report said.And ""women at all stages in the process of becoming an MP (expressed) concern about the levels of abuse and harassment they experience with many fearing for their safety"".

2018-11-02,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

2018-11-02,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-02,Not all winners,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46036800,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSpending on public health, and doctors' and nurses' training in England is set to fall next year according to the fine print of the Budget documents.The chancellor announced annual real-terms funding increases for NHS England which provides front-line services. But other areas of health spending run by the Department of Health will fall in 2019-20, according to a think tank. Government sources indicated that there were other revenues of income to boost Department of Health funding, including immigrant surcharges, which could be spent on services outside NHS England.The Health Foundation think tank has analysed the Budget paperwork and says that while the NHS England budget for day-to-day running costs will rise by nearly £4bn in real terms next year, there will be a reduction of £1bn, or 12%, in other areas of the health budget.This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health. It also includes the budget for Health Education England.The previous Chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training.The Conservative chairwoman of the Health Select Committee, Sarah Wollaston, told the BBC any further cuts would be unacceptable: ""We cannot see money transferred from other parts of the Budget such as public health or training budgets to fund NHS England rises.  ""This would have serious consequences and undermine the commitments made to the NHS this summer.""Labour's Barbara Keeley said it was ""incredibly short-sighted given the workforce challenges in the NHS"".  Others argued that in the long run, it would cost the NHS far more if investment did not go into prevention and early intervention. Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation, said that ministers may have to resort to raiding budgets set aside for investment in NHS buildings and technology.""If the government wants to avoid further cuts to education and public health, it will need to shift all of the planned capital growth to day-to-day resource budgets,"" she said.A government source said that the numbers in the Budget did not include sources of income, including surcharges for immigrants, which could be passed on to areas like public health. In the past, health budgets in England have been propped up with money switched from investment known as capital spending (such as money for new buildings) and it's possible this will happen again next year.The budget for day-to-day running costs for NHS England is £114.6bn for 2018-19, and the equivalent overall budget for the Department of Health is £123.3bn."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-11-02,Labour Party conference,https://web.archive.org//web/20181103004318/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful.Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal.Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to £500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

""We are also working together to ensure the unique bilateral ties between our countries remain strong into the future,"" a spokesperson added.Mr Varadkar also said he had a good relationship with Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).The DUP and Sinn Féin need to come to an agreement to reinstate the Stormont Assembly, he said.Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn Féin - split in a bitter row.If there was some clarity on Brexit in the next couple of weeks or months, there would be an opportunity to get the executive up and running again, Mr Varadkar added.The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which may include physical checks or infrastructure, but cannot agree how.A key part of the negotiation is the controversial border ""backstop"".The backstop is a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal.In a backstop situation, there could in theory be two types of Irish Sea checks: The government has been adamant it would never accept Irish Sea customs checks. But it has also been careful not to completely close down the prospect of regulatory checks."
2018-11-03,EU plans post-Brexit London 'embassy',https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46076860,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union plans to have a 29-strong team of diplomats in London to represent it after Brexit. It will be called a ""delegation"" - not an embassy - and will be part of the EU's foreign policy arm, the European External Action Service (EEAS).There will also be a mission with five staff in Belfast to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement in Northern Ireland - if there is a Brexit deal.The plans will be discussed next week.They will be presented for approval by ambassadors from the 27 remaining EU countries on Wednesday. The European Commission has offices in all member states. Currently it has a team of 27 staff based at Europe House, in Smith Square, Westminster.Once the UK leaves the EU in March next year, that office will be replaced by a new London outpost for the EEAS. It will be about a third of the size of its equivalent in Washington DC, which has 90 personnel - although only 30 of them are classed as European diplomats.Whether the delegation will stay in the Smith Square building - the former headquarters of the Conservative Party - is not yet known.However, the European Commission's offices in Scotland and Wales are likely to close. The new European Union ambassador to the UK will be appointed at a later date by its foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Being Brussels' man or woman in London could be a plum job, or the occupant could find themselves sidelined in future negotiations with London. Earlier this year, the European Commission denied that Martin Selmayr - its secretary-general and a former aide to its president Jean-Claude Juncker - was a potential candidate. The EU has 140 delegations to countries and organisations, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.Its External Action Service was established by the Lisbon Treaty to develop and deliver the EU's common foreign and security policy.

2018-11-03,Police probe into anti-Semitism in Labour,https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46070229,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPolice have launched a criminal inquiry into allegations of anti-Semitic hate crimes within the Labour Party. Met Police chief Cressida Dick told the BBC her officers were assessing online material because it appears ""there may have been a crime committed"". It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media.Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the party should have notified the police itself.""I think they have a duty of care to their members where there are allegations of race hate crimes,"" she told BBC News.""For me as a Jewish Labour MP... there is a feeling of fear about and that is why firm action taken by the police and the party is so important.""LBC handed the dossier to Ms Dick in an interview in September. Before it did so, it showed the material to former Met police officer Mak Chishty, whose view was that 17 instances should have been reported to the police for investigation, and another four were potential race hate crimes.LBC said the allegations included threats against members of Parliament, including a message on Facebook that a female Labour MP was a ""zionist extremist...who hates civilised people"" and is ""about to get a good kicking"".The Met Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her officers were seeking advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and hoped to conclude the investigations quickly.She made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. ""We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves.""However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it. ""We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed.""It is understood Labour has not been contacted by the police and has not been told of the exact nature of the allegations being investigated. A party spokesman said a ""robust system"" was in place for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour rules by its members. ""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way.""Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told Today he was ""not surprised"" by the allegations and anyone engaging in such behaviour must have the ""full force of the law"" applied to them.""If this does one thing, it will silence a small number of people, who still believe that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in my party or in other parties, and that hampers the campaign to try and deal with this problem as quickly and as swiftly and as forcefully as we can,"" he said. In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue.It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech.The party is currently working through a backlog of cases of alleged anti-Semitism complaints against members. But MP Dame Louise Ellman, vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, suggested the party had failed to properly investigate ""potentially very serious"" cases and she hoped, at the very least, Mr Corbyn was aware of the file. ""The disgraceful position Labour is in is continuing,"" she told BBC News. ""I would have thought the people responsible would have learnt their lesson by now. It appears they have not done so.""The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was a ""deeply embedded"" culture of anti-Semitism within parts of Labour.""This comes as no surprise to us,"" said the organisation's vice president Amanda Bowman. ""We have repeatedly set out what Labour needs to do, including taking firm action against anti-Semites and making its opaque processes transparent."""
2018-11-03,16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms,https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46076119,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt least 16 MPs have received free sports tickets from betting companies since the 2017 general election. A BBC analysis of parliament's register of MPs' interests has revealed that 13% of the £175,580 worth of sports tickets accepted by MPs came from betting companies, including William Hill and Ladbrokes.The analysis comes after Tracey Crouch resigned as sports minister and appeared to criticise politicians who have links to the betting industry.In her letter to Theresa May on Thursday evening, Ms Crouch complained that the reduction in the maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was ""being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests.""    Of the 16 MPs, nine were Labour MPs, six Conservative and one SNP.Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, received free tickets worth a total of £5,759 since the general election. He was hosted at 13 horse racing events by Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Sky Bet, which also offered him free tickets to the 2017 League One play-off between Millwall and Bradford City.Mr Davies, a backbench MP, chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gambling.He has spoken out against restricting FOBTs numerous times in Parliament.For example, in March 2016, he said: ""The inconvenient truth is that problem gambling rates have reduced since the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals.""And in November of the same year:""Can the Minister tell us what the point is of reducing the stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops when people can go straight on to the internet and play exactly the same games with unlimited stakes?""The BBC approached Mr Davies for comment but, so far, hasn't received a response. Speaking to the Times, he denied using his links to encourage the government to change its position: ""I'm flattered anyone thinks I could be so influential"", he said.The second most common guest of betting companies was Conservative MP Laurence Robertson, who received the hospitality of William Hill and Ladbrokes at a cost of £5,175 since the election.On Thursday, during an urgent question tabled by Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson, he criticised the focus on FOBTs, drawing attention to the ""losses that will be suffered on the high street in terms of the jobs of men, women and young people, who will also suffer poverty, and the losses to the horse racing industry.""Mr Robertson has links to the horse racing industry and, when contacted by the BBC, he said ""it would be odd if I didn't visit racecourses in various capacities.""That's because - he pointed out - his constituency of Tewkesbury includes the Cheltenham racecourse and he has been a co-chair of the APPG on racing and bloodstock for 8 years.Mr Robertson has previously defended the industry in parliament. During a Westminster Hall debate on 26 April 2016, he said: ""There are people with addictive natures who will be addicted to something, whether that is alcohol, drugs or gambling, but we are discussing only one form of gambling, and many other forms are available.""Some Conservative MPs have highlighted a series of donations made to Tom Watson by millionaire former poker player Derek Webb, who founded the anti-FOBT Campaign for Fairer Gambling. Mr Watson told the Daily Mail he had been highlighting the issue before he met Mr Webb and was proud to campaign alongside him.Within Labour's ranks, Tonia Antoniazzi topped the list. The MP for Gower received tickets and hospitality worth £1,693 from betting firms - including for boxing and darts.Ms Antoniazzi told the BBC that the darts tickets were to play in a parliamentary charity darts competition. She added that she has been ""a constant supporter of reducing the stake of fixed odds betting terminals.""The BBC's analysis does not cover events attended by government ministers in their official capacity.Out of 235 free sports events attended by MPs since the general election, two of the top three most common donors are betting companies: William Hill totalled 24 gifts at a value of £13,273 and Ladbrokes Coral Group hosted 14.A spokesperson for William Hill said: ""As a business that has sport at its core, and is a major sponsor of sports events including horse racing, we do invite MPs of all parties and views to find out more about the industry."""
2018-11-03,Brexit deal 'will not jeopardise UK integrity',https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46065909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity.Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland.He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont.Asked three times if the government had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish Sea ports, he said: ""We are engaged in a negotiation process.""He added that he was not going to engage in a running commentary but said the UK position was ""we want to preserve the internal market within the United Kingdom"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said she made it clear to Mr Raab it is important that ""as well as not having as customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.When asked by BBC News NI if Mr Raab gave that assurance, Mrs Foster said it is ""an ongoing process"".Following her meeting with Mr Raab, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald accused the government of acting ""in bad faith"" over Brexit and warned the border issue is not a ""footnote"".She added that the government has ""stepped back"" from its commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in negotiations.Ms McDonald added that the Sinn Féin meeting with the Brexit secretary was ""direct"".Earlier, Mr Raab was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night"" on his visit to Northern Ireland.He met politicians and business leaders and visited Warrenpoint Port in County Down and Larne Harbour in County Antrim.However, Sinn Féin South Down MP Chris Hazzard protested that the Brexit secretary had refused to meet local politicians.Speaking outside Warrenpoint Port, Mr Hazzard said it was an example of ""the cynicism and disrespect"" being shown to the electorate of South Down and that Mr Raab had come in ""like a thief in the night"" without listening to people and their concerns about leaving the EU.SDLP MLA Sinéad Bradley said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that Mr Raab had not found time to meet local politicians.""I suspect he did not want to hear the voice of the people of the area,"" she said.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in current withdrawal negotiations.Colm Shannon of Newry Chamber of Commerce described Mr Raab's visit to Warrenpoint as ""a welcome opportunity for local businesses to highlight our concerns about the border and future trading relationships with the EU"".""It was a useful visit. He listened to the concerns of local businesses, particularly those that trade north-south,"" he said.  He said an open border and freedom to trade east and west were essential to the continued success of the port.The backstop is an arrangement which will apply if the Irish border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now in the context of a wider deal.DUP speaking after Raab meet. They emphasise they don’t want any new regulatory checks GB-NI. From Arlene Foster’s answer I’m not 100% sure they got they assurance. Let’s hear with DR says later. pic.twitter.com/ZKjhoBW0iBEnd of Twitter post  by @JP_BizThe EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period.A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks.The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"".However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"".November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added.Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks.Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon.Mr Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan hosted a meeting in Dublin on Friday for the latest session of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC).It was the second time in about three months the conference was held, after not being convened for more than a decade.The British government was represented by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.

2018-11-03,Call to ditch 'bonkers' fracking plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071985,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFracking is controversial, this much we know. But the government has ratcheted-up tensions with plans that could see shale gas projects fast-tracked in future. Those tensions were particularly apparent this week at a packed out parliamentary debate. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs lined up to lambast the proposals and call for a rethink. It comes as Cuadrilla announced that it had produced the first natural gas from its site in Lancashire.So what's causing all the consternation? Well, one idea that the government's recently consulted on is whether non-hydraulic shale gas exploration projects should be granted planning permission through ""permitted development rights"".For anyone who's built a kitchen extension or conservatory, it may be a familiar phrase.  Permitted developments, in the government's own words, provide a ""simpler, more certain route to encourage development"".Crucially, that removes the need to put in a planning application to the local council although the relevant licenses and environmental permits would still have to be obtained.Leading this week's Westminster Hall debate, the Conservative MP for Fylde, Mark Menzies, said that the idea was ""nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers"".He described some of the infrastructure and traffic that can surround shale gas sites and asked, ""Who on earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow?""  Fracking was temporarily halted this week at Lancashire's Preston New Road site after a 1.1 magnitude tremor. Shale gas firm Cuadrilla said the tremor was no cause for concern and, now it's seen the first signs of natural gas flowing to the surface, the industry may feel a renewed sense of confidence.An aerial view of the gas at Preston New Road pic.twitter.com/4QsJ6QpF4IEnd of Twitter post  by @CuadrillaUKIt's worth pointing out that the current hydraulic operations there would not have fallen under the government's proposed permitted development scheme. But the tremor has provided fuel for critics of the government's fracking policy. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the government's proposals as a ""subversion"" of local democracy. ""Permitted development was created for conservatories, small extensions and outhouses none of which to the best of my knowledge have ever created an earth tremor,"" he said in the debate. Ministers have also consulted on the planning process for fracking sites should they reach the actual hydraulic production stage. Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract gas or oil by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals, at high pressure, into the earth via drilled boreholes. The water mixture opens up cracks in the rock and the sand lodges into the spaces to keep them open, allowing for the release of gas. The government's proposals, for permitted development, would only apply to non-hydraulic shale gas exploration. This works without the use of fluid pressure but allows companies to drill for core samples. However, many argue that even exploration sites can cause considerable disruption to local communities. The government is looking at whether such applications could be included in something known as the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime or NSIPs. Think major new roads, railway lines and airports. NSIPs typically see a Planning Inspector present a report and recommendations to the relevant Secretary of State. Local councils get to ""inform"" the decision, but they certainly don't get to make it.Given the government's much-trumpeted commitment to ""localism"", the irony has not been lost on Conservative MPs. East Yorkshire's Sir Greg Knight said: ""If the government is being consistent, shouldn't local communities have more say on fracking matters and not have their voice taken away?"" He was one of 10 Tory MPs to express concerns at this week's debate and there are more. Misgivings range from cautious scepticism to outright anger. North East Derbyshire is a marginal seat where a company recently won permission, through appeal, to look for shale gas. The constituency's Conservative MP, Lee Rowley, has described the government's proposals as ""ludicrous"", adding that, ""fracking in my view will not work in this country"". Ministers point to the fact that permitted development rights do contain exclusions and restrictions that can mitigate a development's impact. They also say that NSIPs do see local communities consulted at an early stage while councils can submit written representations during the examination process.  But there has been a hint this week, perhaps, of some political nervousness. On the back of two consultations, that many argued amounted to undermining local democracy, a third consultation has appeared all about ""strengthening community engagement""; specifically whether it should be compulsory for shale gas firms to consult communities at the pre-application stage. Planning Minister Kit Malthouse this week told MPs: ""We believe this could further strengthen the role local people play in the process."" But it's led to claims that the government is now ""all over the place"" on its fracking policy. Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron said: ""This is the most inconsistent, confusing thing that I've seen in all my 35 years in parliament.""The government's determination to explore the potential of fracking is based on the hope that it could deliver greater energy security, jobs and cheaper gas for consumers. There is also some considerable frustration at the sluggish, yet fraught, way in which shale gas applications can currently be processed at a local authority level. Energy minister Claire Perry has previously said it is ""a morass of protest and counter-prevailing information and frankly I pity any local councillor that gets an application on their desk because they will shortly have a travelling circus of protestors most of whom do not hail from the areas where those sites are located.""  Ministers do insist that they remain fully committed to ensuring that local communities are properly involved in any application whilst also ensuring that the process is sped up. However, when it comes to controversial shale gas schemes, there is a real question over whether those two aims can easily be reconciled. And also whether the government can contain the evident displeasure and disquiet amongst some of its own MPs. "

But in practice, EU nationals will still be able to come and work in the UK, until the end of the planned 21-month ""transition period"". The only difference is that they will have to register with the authorities.Ms Nokes was questioned at length on Tuesday about what would happen if there was no ""transition period"" - because the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a withdrawal deal - and whether employers would be expected to check if potential staff had the right to work in the UK.Committee chair Yvette Cooper asked how an employer could be expected to differentiate between someone who had arrived in the UK after Brexit - and an EU citizen who had been a long term resident and had the right to work, but had not yet applied for ""settled status"".Ms Nokes admitted it would be ""almost impossible for an employer to differentiate between a new arrival and somebody who has been here for 10 years and has simply not yet been through the scheme"".But she said: ""If somebody has been through the settled status scheme, they will be able to evidence that. If somebody has not been here prior to the end of March next year, then employers will have to make sure that they go through adequately rigorous checks to evidence somebody's right to work.""Her remarks were met with ""deep concern"" from the Federation of Small Businesses, whose chairman Mike Cherry said:  ""The reality is that many of these businesses wouldn't have the first idea of where, or how, to check whether or not their EU staff have the right to work here.""The 3million, which campaigns for the rights of EU citizens in the UK, reported that the Home Office had emailed to confirm current checks ""will not change next March in the event we leave the EU without a deal"".And that ""EU citizens will continue to be able to evidence their right to work by showing a passport or national identity card."" Employers would not be expected to differentiate between ""resident EU citizens and those arriving after exit"".On Friday, the Home Office confirmed that statement and added: ""We will protect EU citizens' rights when we leave the EU, in both a deal or no deal scenario.""We are considering a number of options for the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without a deal, and will set out more information shortly.""Under current rules, employers must carry out ""right to work"" checks on new staff. For British citizens, this means providing a passport or birth certificate and a National Insurance number while EU citizens must provide their passport or ID card and people from outside the EU must provide their biometric residence permit."

Both groups have denied wrongdoing and accused the commission of a politically-motivated attack.On Thursday, the National Crime Agency confirmed it was investigating Leave.EU and its co-founder Arron Banks and chief executive Liz Bilney over separate allegations that it had breached electoral law by accepting loans from ""impermissible sources"".Mr Banks said he welcomed the investigation and was confident it would ""put an end to the ludicrous allegations"".In May, the Commission fined Leave.EU £70,000, saying it had exceeded its spending limit by at least 10% by failing to include at least £77,380 in its spending return. It referred Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney to the police.In July, the elections watchdog fined Vote Leave £61,000 and referred the campaign to the Met, saying it had exceeded its £7m spending limit by funnelling £675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave.The Met has denied reported claims that ""political sensitivities"" had delayed the Met's probe.The force says it was not until 7 September that it received ""over 900 documents"" relating to both referrals from the Electoral Commission.On Friday, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have been passed by the Electoral Commission, on two separate occasions, a huge amount of material.""""They pass us material when they think it may be a matter for the police, there may have been some crime committed and we are assessing that material and we are doing that carefully.""It's just at a scoping stage so it would be wrong for me to say, before we know what we have got properly in the material and what it amounts to, whether there is any criminal investigation there or not. At the moment we are just assessing that and we will do that properly.""Vote Leave said the Electoral Commission's report was ""wholly inaccurate"" and politically motivated, accusing it of basing its conclusions on ""unfounded claims and conspiracy theories"". Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks has described the Commission's findings as a ""politically motivated attack"" and said he would challenge them in court.Some Remain supporters have suggested Brexit should be put on hold pending the outcome of the National Crime Agency inquiry.The UK's referendum in June 2016 was about whether the UK should Remain or Leave the European Union. The result was that the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU. This departure is due to happen on 29 March 2019."

He said a Labour government would focus instead on a ""fairer taxation system"" asking the richest 5% to pay more and rolling back cuts to corporation tax cuts.But a number of Labour MPs have said the party should oppose the income tax changes, because they argue they disproportionately benefit the better-off.In Thursday's debate, 20 Labour MPs voted against the tax changes, in defiance of the party leadership: Karen Buck, Yvette Cooper, Neil Coyle, Stella Creasy, Mike Gapes, Roger Godsiff, Kate Green, Margaret Hodge, Helen Jones, Liz Kendal, David Lammy, Pat McFadden, Alison McGovern, Ian Murray, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Lucy Powell, Emma Reynolds, Gareth Snell and Martin Whitfield.Former cabinet minister Ms Cooper criticised the government, saying: ""They're going ahead with over £1bn in real cuts to tax credits and benefits this coming year for the poorest families.""At the same time they are choosing to spend about the same amount of money on tax cuts for higher rate taxpayers, including those on more than £100,000 a year.""A lone parent with a four-year-old working part-time could end up being nearly £3,000 worse off whereas the high earners end up being over £1,000 better off.""SNP work and pensions spokesman Neil Gray accused the chancellor of having brought in a tax cut which ""disproportionately benefits higher earners the most"" instead of stopping the benefit freeze.For the government, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said it was a shame Mr McDonnell's party did not agree with him and joked to the shadow chancellor there was ""space for you on our frontbench"".

The Guido Fawkes website said one in four of its staff may leave and all had been offered voluntary redundancy.The party, which has struggled since its disastrous 2015 general election, said its priority was winning votes and seats at the next election.The Lib Dems have seen a boost in membership since the 2016 EU referendum, but have struggled to attract attention in the Brexit debate, despite being the main party campaigning for another referendum, and they continue to languish in the opinion polls.Sir Vince, who was a cabinet minister in the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government between 2010 and 2015, has said he will step down once Brexit ""is resolved or stopped"".He has also said he wants to make progress on proposed reforms aimed at turning the party into a mass movement - which could see supporters become members for free and non-MPs stand to be leader.According to its 2017 accounts, 68 staff work at the party's headquarters, led by chief executive Sir Nick Harvey, the former MP and minister. The party incurred a deficit in its finances of more than £700,000 in 2017 - due to increased spending on the general election campaign, which saw an increase in MPs from eight to 12 but a fall in overall vote share. Sir Vince said the ""adjustment"" in staffing was a product of the political climate. ""We've been campaigning on Brexit, our resources have been going into that and some of the general activities have been cut back,"" he said.""It doesn't affect our effectiveness as a political movement although obviously it's difficult for the individuals if we're having to scale back and there are fewer jobs.""The Lib Dems have always struggled to compete financially with the Conservatives and Labour, which get much of their funding from business and the unions respectively. The party received £6.1m in donations in 2017 and got £1.2m from membership income. In recent years, the party has scaled back its autumn conference from five to four days and said its spring gathering needs to become more ""cost-effective"".In a statement, a spokeswoman said: ""We are in the process of carrying out a reorganisation which will see a reduction in the number of staff at our headquarters. ""We are focussing our resources to carry on leading the fight against Brexit and taking on power and privilege to build a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.""The party's former leader Nick Clegg, who lost his seat in last year's election, announced he had been hired by Facebook as its head of global affairs."

However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But other areas of health spending run by the Department of Health will fall in 2019-20, according to a think tank. Government sources indicated that there were other revenues of income to boost Department of Health funding, including immigrant surcharges, which could be spent on services outside NHS England.The Health Foundation think tank has analysed the Budget paperwork and says that while the NHS England budget for day-to-day running costs will rise by nearly £4bn in real terms next year, there will be a reduction of £1bn, or 12%, in other areas of the health budget.This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health. It also includes the budget for Health Education England.The previous Chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training.The Conservative chairwoman of the Health Select Committee, Sarah Wollaston, told the BBC any further cuts would be unacceptable: ""We cannot see money transferred from other parts of the Budget such as public health or training budgets to fund NHS England rises.  ""This would have serious consequences and undermine the commitments made to the NHS this summer.""Labour's Barbara Keeley said it was ""incredibly short-sighted given the workforce challenges in the NHS"".  Others argued that in the long run, it would cost the NHS far more if investment did not go into prevention and early intervention. Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation, said that ministers may have to resort to raiding budgets set aside for investment in NHS buildings and technology.""If the government wants to avoid further cuts to education and public health, it will need to shift all of the planned capital growth to day-to-day resource budgets,"" she said.A government source said that the numbers in the Budget did not include sources of income, including surcharges for immigrants, which could be passed on to areas like public health. In the past, health budgets in England have been propped up with money switched from investment known as capital spending (such as money for new buildings) and it's possible this will happen again next year.The budget for day-to-day running costs for NHS England is £114.6bn for 2018-19, and the equivalent overall budget for the Department of Health is £123.3bn."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-03,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-11-03,Labour Party conference,https://web.archive.org//web/20181104014641/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful.Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal.Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to £500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

They have written to Prime Minister Theresa May to say that Parliament should not be bound by the 2016 vote.""Democratic government is not frozen in time,"" the letter said.Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice, were among the signatories.It comes after more than 70 business leaders also called for another referendum, with a campaign group called Business for a People's Vote preparing to launch on Thursday.Prime Minister Theresa May has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016.The letter signed by the lawyers said questions over the validity of the 2016 vote meant it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum that took the UK into the EU.In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said.By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter.""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality.""The lawyers said that ""voters are entitled to know what they are voting for.""Jonathan Cooper, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said he had signed the letter with colleagues because a further public vote was not just ""the right thing to do, it is the most democratic thing to do as well"".""The current state of the Brexit negotiations is worrying people throughout the UK and the legal profession is no exception to that,"" he said.""We represent people from across industry and society and we see every day the way the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit deal is already causing real harm.""A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU.""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said."

""For me, he was my wonderful partner for 22 years. We shared everything and I will miss him more than I can say"". Sir Jeremy first joined the civil service in 1983 as an economist for the Health and Safety Executive before moving to the Treasury, where he worked under chancellors Ken Clarke and Gordon Brown.He had a long career at the top of government, serving four prime ministers in different roles while also spending four years in the banking sector working for Morgan Stanley.In January 2012, Sir Jeremy was knighted and made cabinet secretary - a position sometimes described as the second most powerful person in the government after the prime minister.Cabinet secretaries keep a low public profile but they sit next to the PM at cabinet meetings - and it is their job to ensure policies are put into action and offer advice on running the machinery of government.  He managed former Labour PM Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organised Gordon Brown's Downing Street, helped to hold the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition together, and, finally, supported Mrs May's minority administration.Former Treasury minister Yvette Cooper said Sir Jeremy had done ""a lot to hold government together at very difficult times"".Mr Brown described him as a ""leader of exceptional ability and ""unquestioned integrity"".""Jeremy Heywood was the most dynamic civil servant of his generation, a leader who inspired confidence, whose expertise was recognised by all and and whose impartiality was never in doubt.""Mr Blair said Sir Jeremy had been ""a quite outstanding public servant and someone I came to have enormous respect for both as a professional and as a person"".Sir Jeremy first joined the civil service in 1983 and Sir Mark Sedwill, his successor as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, described him as an ""exemplary public servant"".""We will miss him more than we can say,"" Sir Mark said, adding the country ""will be the poorer without his advice, leadership and extraordinary insight"".

He served governments of all colours with dedication, and unmatched workrate and intelligence. A huge huge loss. Love to Suzanne and the childrenEnd of Twitter post  by @campbellclaretHis career was not without controversy, however. He was given the nickname ""Sir cover-up"" by tabloid newspapers after it emerged he had blocked the release of letters and phone calls between Mr Blair and then US president George Bush in the run-up to the Iraq war.He said he felt ""frustrated"" by the label and argued that he had been the most transparent cabinet secretary ever.He found himself at the centre of a number of political crises during his career - he was at Tory Chancellor Norman Lamont's side with the pound crashed out of the European Exchange Rate mechanism in 1992. He also faced criticism for breaking protocol by not taking minutes of key meetings between Mr Blair and officials, which was revealed in evidence to the inquiry into the death of the weapons inspector Dr David Kelly."

Ms Crouch said she had been working under the assumption that the new maximum stake of £2 every 20 seconds would be introduced in April 2019.In her first interview since resigning, Ms Crouch told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There have been conversations that have taken place with many members of Parliament with different interests and, as I say, on this occasion, clearly I wasn't as persuasive as some of my other colleagues."" Ms Crouch was asked about a newspaper report suggesting she believed a meeting between Conservative MP Philip Davies and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Wright was key to the delay.She refused to confirm the details of the report, saying: ""All meetings are registered. I'm sure it will all come out anyway.""She added Mr Davies was ""very vocal in Parliament on behalf of the betting industry"".Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems.Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government. Ms Crouch also voiced her disappointment that the proposed sale of Wembley Stadium had not materialised.Shahid Khan, who owns Premier League club Fulham and NFL side the Jacksonville Jaguars, withdrew a £600m offer due to a lack of support from FA council members.Ms Crouch said she hoped the deal could be resurrected to provide ""opportunities to get a significant investment"" into grassroots football.She added the sale of the England national team stadium could also bring about the possibility of an NFL franchise in London and therefore a ""£100m per annum economic boost""."
2018-11-04,Banks challenged over Leave.EU funds,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46089236,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBusinessman Arron Banks has been challenged to explain where the money for his Brexit campaign came from.Mr Banks is the subject of a police probe into claims he was not the ""true source"" of £8m loaned to his Leave.EU campaign in the 2016 EU referendum.The Electoral Commission referred the case to the National Crime Agency, which said potential criminal offences may have been committed. Mr Banks told the BBC's Andrew Marr the money came from his UK businesses.Foreign donations to political campaigns are banned under UK law. Mr Banks has faced claims that money to fund Leave.EU came from Russian sources - something he has repeatedly denied.""There was no Russian money and no interference of any type. I want to be absolutely clear about that,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show.""The money came from Rock Services which was a UK limited company.""Mr Banks was also asked about a report in the Sunday Times that he would back Remain if the 2016 referendum were re-run.He replied: ""What I said was that the corruption I have seen in British politics, the sewer that exists and the disgraceful behaviour of the government over what they are doing with Brexit and how they are selling out, means that if I had my time again I think we would have been better to probably remain and not unleash these demons.""The Electoral Commission says it suspects the money came from Rock Services parent company Rock Holdings, which is registered in the Isle of Man and so ""could not lawfully make any donation or be a party to any loan to Leave.EU"".The Commission referred the case to the National Crime Agency because it has the ability to investigate financial transactions in the Isle of Man, something that is beyond the scope of the electoral watchdog.Mr Banks denied Rock Services was a ""shell company"" that did not have sufficient funds to be the source of the money for Better for the Country (BFTC), which ran Leave.EU. In its report on the case, the Electoral Commission said: ""We have reasonable grounds to suspect that Rock Services did not fund the payments of £8m it is said it made to BFTC from its UK-generated income"".Mr Banks has given two apparently different explanations about the role of Rock Services.In his evidence to the Culture Media and Sport Committee in June, Mr Banks described Rock Services as ""just a service company"". He told MPs: ""The actual loan came from one of my companies that was delivered in.""In his Andrew Marr interview he again described Rock Services as a ""service company"" but said it was a UK limited company and the £8m donation came out of ""insurance business written in the UK"".He said: ""We turn over £250m of premiums, it's a sizeable business"" and added Rock Services has ""all sorts of revenues"" but did not detail them.Labour MP Ian Lucas, a member of the Commons culture committee that questioned Mr Banks in June, told BBC News: ""There are a number of contradictions that arise from the interview today but I think, fundamentally, the question is that Mr Banks still hasn't given us a proper explanation of where this money came from.""Manveen Rana, BBC Today reporterIn interviews and at select committee hearings, Arron Banks likes to be seen as cheeky and unflappable, almost as if he relishes these appearances. He didn't seem to be enjoying the experience today, often looking rattled during heated exchanges. The money trail was at the heart of the interview. Mr Banks looked most uncomfortable when probed about the relationship between his companies. Despite repeated questions, he insisted the funding he provided for the Brexit campaign came from his UK based company, Rock Services. But when Andrew Marr highlighted Mr Banks' own evidence to a committee of MPs - which apparently differed from this account - he appeared flustered.""I haven't seen the actual transcript of that. I will go back and look at that, but I'm telling you that the source of the funding was Rock Services, "" he said.. Although Arron Banks insisted that he had disclosed the accounts of his Isle of Man company, Rock Holdings, to the BBC, Andrew Marr replied that they were ""redacted"" and showed very little. The questions about where the £8m donation came from will linger. Arron Banks denies all wrongdoing, but as the criminal investigation now gets under way, he can expect an uncomfortable few months of financial scrutiny.  The National Crime Agency said: ""This is now a live investigation, and we are unable to discuss any operational detail.""Separately, the Metropolitan Police is examining whether to launch a criminal investigation into whether Leave.EU broke its £700,000 spending limits, after a file was handed to it by the Electoral Commission. The Met is also examining electoral law breaches by the official Vote Leave campaign.And, in another development, Mr Banks has been accused of misleading Parliament over links between Leave.EU and his insurance businesses.The Observer says it has seen internal emails leaked by former employees of Eldon Insurance, another of Mr Banks's companies, and Rock Services that show they worked on the Leave.EU campaign from their company offices.Conservative MP and chairman of the culture media and sport committee, Damian Collins, told The Observer the leaked e-mails appeared to ""flatly contradict"" what Mr Banks had told his committee in June.Mr Banks told Andrew Marr: ""I can say that was reported to the Electoral Commission, and people who did work for Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts legally, and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way.""You are talking about emails that were stolen from us.""The Electoral Commission said Leave.EU ""did not report spending on or donations from Eldon"". On Tuesday, the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, will appear before the culture committee to announce the outcome of an inquiry into claims that Eldon shared customer data obtained for insurance purposes with Leave.EU, potentially breaking data protection laws.""We are also investigating whether Eldon Insurance Limited's call centre staff used customer databases to make calls on behalf of Leave.EU in contravention of the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations 2003,"" the ICO said in an interim report in July."

Richard Reed, co-founder of Innocent Drinks and Martha Lane Fox, the founder of Lastminute.com - who both campaigned for Remain - signed the letter, as did Lord Myners, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer.It reads: ""The business community was promised that, if the country voted to leave, there would continue to be frictionless trade with the EU and the certainty about future relations that we need to invest for the long term.   ""Despite the Prime Minister's best efforts, the proposals being discussed by the government and the European Commission fall far short of this. ""The uncertainty over the past two years has already led to a slump in investment.""The letter concludes: ""We are now facing either a blindfold or a destructive hard Brexit. ""Given that neither was on the ballot in 2016, we believe the ultimate choice should be handed back to the public with a People's Vote."" Waterstones chief executive James Daunt told the BBC: ""All the paper we use is imported.

2018-11-04,Brexit 'fraying' UK-Irish relationship,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46083327,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Irish prime minister says Brexit is fraying relations between Ireland and Britain.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it had also ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).The GFA was signed by political parties in Northern Ireland in 1998 and was aimed at establishing peace after 30 years of The Troubles.The UK government says ""nothing we agree with the EU will risk a return to a hard border"".The Irish border is one of the biggest sticking points in the Brexit negotiations.""Anything that pulls the communities apart in Northern Ireland undermines the Good Friday Agreement, and anything that pulls Britain and Ireland apart undermines that relationship,"" said Mr Varadkar on RTE's Marian Finucane programme.Earlier, the chair of the Republic of Ireland's Senate Brexit Committee said a return to a hard border threatened the peace process.Senator Neale Richmond told pro-Brexit Conservative MP Owen Paterson on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that plans for solving the border dispute using ""existing practical systems"" was ""completely unfeasible"".Brexit talks have reached an impasse over the EU's ""backstop"" plan, which would see Northern Ireland effectively remaining in the customs union and single market unless alternative arrangements were found to prevent a hard border.The taoiseach's comments came two days after Nobel peace prize winner and Conservative Lord Trimble accused Mr Varadkar's government of ""riding roughshod"" over the GFA.Lord Trimble, who helped draw up the landmark agreement, said the Brexit process could result in Northern Ireland ending up as part of an ""effective EU protectorate"".Mr Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, reiterated that claim, saying that any backstop which involved the whole UK staying in a customs union would be a ""total betrayal"" of millions of Leave voters and the 85% of voters at the last general election who backed Tory and Labour manifestos which committed to leaving.The Irish prime minister said Ireland was entering into a potentially difficult period, even if an agreement was struck.The UK government said any deal would not "" threaten the arrangements under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, and we continue to work very closely with the Irish Government on this"". ""We are also working together to ensure the unique bilateral ties between our countries remain strong into the future,"" a spokesperson added.Mr Varadkar also said he had a good relationship with Arlene Foster, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).The DUP and Sinn Féin need to come to an agreement to reinstate the Stormont Assembly, he said.Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the power-sharing parties - the DUP and Sinn Féin - split in a bitter row.If there was some clarity on Brexit in the next couple of weeks or months, there would be an opportunity to get the executive up and running again, Mr Varadkar added.The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which may include physical checks or infrastructure, but cannot agree how.A key part of the negotiation is the controversial border ""backstop"".The backstop is a position of last resort, to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal.In a backstop situation, there could in theory be two types of Irish Sea checks: The government has been adamant it would never accept Irish Sea customs checks. But it has also been careful not to completely close down the prospect of regulatory checks."

Met Police chief Cressida Dick told the BBC her officers were assessing online material because it appears ""there may have been a crime committed"". It comes after LBC Radio obtained what it said was an internal Labour document detailing 45 cases, involving messages posted by members on social media.Labour MP Margaret Hodge said the party should have notified the police itself.""I think they have a duty of care to their members where there are allegations of race hate crimes,"" she told BBC News.""For me as a Jewish Labour MP... there is a feeling of fear about and that is why firm action taken by the police and the party is so important.""LBC handed the dossier to Ms Dick in an interview in September. Before it did so, it showed the material to former Met police officer Mak Chishty, whose view was that 17 instances should have been reported to the police for investigation, and another four were potential race hate crimes.LBC said the allegations included threats against members of Parliament, including a message on Facebook that a female Labour MP was a ""zionist extremist...who hates civilised people"" and is ""about to get a good kicking"".The Met Commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her officers were seeking advice from the Crown Prosecution Service and hoped to conclude the investigations quickly.She made it clear the Labour Party itself was not under investigation. ""We would always want institutions and political parties and similar to be able to regulate themselves.""However, if somebody passes us material which they say amounts to a crime we have a duty to look at that and not just dismiss it. ""We have been assessing some material that was passed to me, in a radio studio of all things, about two months ago and we are now investigating some of that material because it appears there may have been crime committed.""It is understood Labour has not been contacted by the police and has not been told of the exact nature of the allegations being investigated. A party spokesman said a ""robust system"" was in place for investigating complaints of alleged breaches of Labour rules by its members. ""Where someone feels they have been a victim of crime, they should report it to the police in the usual way.""Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told Today he was ""not surprised"" by the allegations and anyone engaging in such behaviour must have the ""full force of the law"" applied to them.""If this does one thing, it will silence a small number of people, who still believe that anti-Semitism doesn't exist in my party or in other parties, and that hampers the campaign to try and deal with this problem as quickly and as swiftly and as forcefully as we can,"" he said. In September, Labour's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after a long-running row about Jeremy Corbyn's handling of the issue.It vowed to incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance into its code of conduct. But Jewish groups criticised an accompanying statement which the party said was aimed at protecting free speech.The party is currently working through a backlog of cases of alleged anti-Semitism complaints against members. But MP Dame Louise Ellman, vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel, suggested the party had failed to properly investigate ""potentially very serious"" cases and she hoped, at the very least, Mr Corbyn was aware of the file. ""The disgraceful position Labour is in is continuing,"" she told BBC News. ""I would have thought the people responsible would have learnt their lesson by now. It appears they have not done so.""The Board of Deputies of British Jews said there was a ""deeply embedded"" culture of anti-Semitism within parts of Labour.""This comes as no surprise to us,"" said the organisation's vice president Amanda Bowman. ""We have repeatedly set out what Labour needs to do, including taking firm action against anti-Semites and making its opaque processes transparent."""
2018-11-04,EU plans post-Brexit London 'embassy',https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46076860,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe European Union plans to have a 29-strong team of diplomats in London to represent it after Brexit. It will be called a ""delegation"" - not an embassy - and will be part of the EU's foreign policy arm, the European External Action Service (EEAS).There will also be a mission with five staff in Belfast to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement in Northern Ireland - if there is a Brexit deal.The plans will be discussed next week.They will be presented for approval by ambassadors from the 27 remaining EU countries on Wednesday. The European Commission has offices in all member states. Currently it has a team of 27 staff based at Europe House, in Smith Square, Westminster.Once the UK leaves the EU in March next year, that office will be replaced by a new London outpost for the EEAS. It will be about a third of the size of its equivalent in Washington DC, which has 90 personnel - although only 30 of them are classed as European diplomats.Whether the delegation will stay in the Smith Square building - the former headquarters of the Conservative Party - is not yet known.However, the European Commission's offices in Scotland and Wales are likely to close. The new European Union ambassador to the UK will be appointed at a later date by its foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Being Brussels' man or woman in London could be a plum job, or the occupant could find themselves sidelined in future negotiations with London. Earlier this year, the European Commission denied that Martin Selmayr - its secretary-general and a former aide to its president Jean-Claude Juncker - was a potential candidate. The EU has 140 delegations to countries and organisations, including the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.Its External Action Service was established by the Lisbon Treaty to develop and deliver the EU's common foreign and security policy.

2018-11-04,16 MPs receive free tickets from betting firms,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46076119,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt least 16 MPs have received free sports tickets from betting companies since the 2017 general election. A BBC analysis of parliament's register of MPs' interests has revealed that 13% of the £175,580 worth of sports tickets accepted by MPs came from betting companies, including William Hill and Ladbrokes.The analysis comes after Tracey Crouch resigned as sports minister and appeared to criticise politicians who have links to the betting industry.In her letter to Theresa May on Thursday evening, Ms Crouch complained that the reduction in the maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was ""being delayed until October 2019 due to commitments made by others to those with registered interests.""    Of the 16 MPs, nine were Labour MPs, six Conservative and one SNP.Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, received free tickets worth a total of £5,759 since the general election. He was hosted at 13 horse racing events by Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Sky Bet, which also offered him free tickets to the 2017 League One play-off between Millwall and Bradford City.Mr Davies, a backbench MP, chairs the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on betting and gambling.He has spoken out against restricting FOBTs numerous times in Parliament.For example, in March 2016, he said: ""The inconvenient truth is that problem gambling rates have reduced since the introduction of fixed odds betting terminals.""And in November of the same year:""Can the Minister tell us what the point is of reducing the stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops when people can go straight on to the internet and play exactly the same games with unlimited stakes?""The BBC approached Mr Davies for comment but, so far, hasn't received a response. Speaking to the Times, he denied using his links to encourage the government to change its position: ""I'm flattered anyone thinks I could be so influential"", he said.The second most common guest of betting companies was Conservative MP Laurence Robertson, who received the hospitality of William Hill and Ladbrokes at a cost of £5,175 since the election.On Thursday, during an urgent question tabled by Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson, he criticised the focus on FOBTs, drawing attention to the ""losses that will be suffered on the high street in terms of the jobs of men, women and young people, who will also suffer poverty, and the losses to the horse racing industry.""Mr Robertson has links to the horse racing industry and, when contacted by the BBC, he said ""it would be odd if I didn't visit racecourses in various capacities.""That's because - he pointed out - his constituency of Tewkesbury includes the Cheltenham racecourse and he has been a co-chair of the APPG on racing and bloodstock for 8 years.Mr Robertson has previously defended the industry in parliament. During a Westminster Hall debate on 26 April 2016, he said: ""There are people with addictive natures who will be addicted to something, whether that is alcohol, drugs or gambling, but we are discussing only one form of gambling, and many other forms are available.""Some Conservative MPs have highlighted a series of donations made to Tom Watson by millionaire former poker player Derek Webb, who founded the anti-FOBT Campaign for Fairer Gambling. Mr Watson told the Daily Mail he had been highlighting the issue before he met Mr Webb and was proud to campaign alongside him.Within Labour's ranks, Tonia Antoniazzi topped the list. The MP for Gower received tickets and hospitality worth £1,693 from betting firms - including for boxing and darts.Ms Antoniazzi told the BBC that the darts tickets were to play in a parliamentary charity darts competition. She added that she has been ""a constant supporter of reducing the stake of fixed odds betting terminals.""The BBC's analysis does not cover events attended by government ministers in their official capacity.Out of 235 free sports events attended by MPs since the general election, two of the top three most common donors are betting companies: William Hill totalled 24 gifts at a value of £13,273 and Ladbrokes Coral Group hosted 14.A spokesperson for William Hill said: ""As a business that has sport at its core, and is a major sponsor of sports events including horse racing, we do invite MPs of all parties and views to find out more about the industry."""
2018-11-04,Brexit deal 'will not jeopardise UK integrity',https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46065909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit Secretary has pledged that the government will not sign up to any deal which could threaten the UK's constitutional integrity.Dominic Raab made the comments after a one-day visit to Northern Ireland.He met with businesses in Warrenpoint and Larne, and he also met with politicians at Stormont.Asked three times if the government had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish Sea ports, he said: ""We are engaged in a negotiation process.""He added that he was not going to engage in a running commentary but said the UK position was ""we want to preserve the internal market within the United Kingdom"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said she made it clear to Mr Raab it is important that ""as well as not having as customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers"" between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.When asked by BBC News NI if Mr Raab gave that assurance, Mrs Foster said it is ""an ongoing process"".Following her meeting with Mr Raab, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald accused the government of acting ""in bad faith"" over Brexit and warned the border issue is not a ""footnote"".She added that the government has ""stepped back"" from its commitment to uphold the Good Friday Agreement.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in negotiations.Ms McDonald added that the Sinn Féin meeting with the Brexit secretary was ""direct"".Earlier, Mr Raab was accused of behaving ""like a thief in the night"" on his visit to Northern Ireland.He met politicians and business leaders and visited Warrenpoint Port in County Down and Larne Harbour in County Antrim.However, Sinn Féin South Down MP Chris Hazzard protested that the Brexit secretary had refused to meet local politicians.Speaking outside Warrenpoint Port, Mr Hazzard said it was an example of ""the cynicism and disrespect"" being shown to the electorate of South Down and that Mr Raab had come in ""like a thief in the night"" without listening to people and their concerns about leaving the EU.SDLP MLA Sinéad Bradley said it was ""an absolute disgrace"" that Mr Raab had not found time to meet local politicians.""I suspect he did not want to hear the voice of the people of the area,"" she said.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" remains the major unresolved issue in current withdrawal negotiations.Colm Shannon of Newry Chamber of Commerce described Mr Raab's visit to Warrenpoint as ""a welcome opportunity for local businesses to highlight our concerns about the border and future trading relationships with the EU"".""It was a useful visit. He listened to the concerns of local businesses, particularly those that trade north-south,"" he said.  He said an open border and freedom to trade east and west were essential to the continued success of the port.The backstop is an arrangement which will apply if the Irish border cannot be kept as frictionless as it is now in the context of a wider deal.DUP speaking after Raab meet.

Let’s hear with DR says later. pic.twitter.com/ZKjhoBW0iBEnd of Twitter post  by @JP_BizThe EU and UK have agreed the need for a backstop, but not how it should operate.The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system.The UK government has rejected it as a threat to the integrity of the UK and has suggested a backstop that would see the UK as a whole remaining aligned with the EU customs union for a limited period.A letter from Mr Raab, published earlier this week, suggested he expects a deal on the UK's exit from the EU to be agreed within three weeks.The Brexit secretary told a committee of MPs he was happy to appear before them to give evidence ""when a deal is finalised"" and ""currently expected 21 November to be suitable"".However, Mr Raab's own department later clarified that there was ""no set date for the negotiations to conclude"".November 21 was the date offered by the committee's chairman, it added.Meanwhile, Ireland's foreign minister has said it is up to the UK to ""intensify"" talks.Simon Coveney, who met Mr Raab on Tuesday evening, said time was short and while an overall deal was possible within three weeks, it had to take shape soon.Mr Coveney and Irish Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan hosted a meeting in Dublin on Friday for the latest session of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIGC).It was the second time in about three months the conference was held, after not being convened for more than a decade.The British government was represented by Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.

2018-11-04,Call to ditch 'bonkers' fracking plan,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071985,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFracking is controversial, this much we know. But the government has ratcheted-up tensions with plans that could see shale gas projects fast-tracked in future. Those tensions were particularly apparent this week at a packed out parliamentary debate. Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs lined up to lambast the proposals and call for a rethink. It comes as Cuadrilla announced that it had produced the first natural gas from its site in Lancashire.So what's causing all the consternation? Well, one idea that the government's recently consulted on is whether non-hydraulic shale gas exploration projects should be granted planning permission through ""permitted development rights"".For anyone who's built a kitchen extension or conservatory, it may be a familiar phrase.  Permitted developments, in the government's own words, provide a ""simpler, more certain route to encourage development"".Crucially, that removes the need to put in a planning application to the local council although the relevant licenses and environmental permits would still have to be obtained.Leading this week's Westminster Hall debate, the Conservative MP for Fylde, Mark Menzies, said that the idea was ""nothing short of irresponsible and downright bonkers"".He described some of the infrastructure and traffic that can surround shale gas sites and asked, ""Who on earth thinks that is equivalent to building a little extension on the side of your bungalow?""  Fracking was temporarily halted this week at Lancashire's Preston New Road site after a 1.1 magnitude tremor. Shale gas firm Cuadrilla said the tremor was no cause for concern and, now it's seen the first signs of natural gas flowing to the surface, the industry may feel a renewed sense of confidence.An aerial view of the gas at Preston New Road pic.twitter.com/4QsJ6QpF4IEnd of Twitter post  by @CuadrillaUKIt's worth pointing out that the current hydraulic operations there would not have fallen under the government's proposed permitted development scheme. But the tremor has provided fuel for critics of the government's fracking policy. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron described the government's proposals as a ""subversion"" of local democracy. ""Permitted development was created for conservatories, small extensions and outhouses none of which to the best of my knowledge have ever created an earth tremor,"" he said in the debate. Ministers have also consulted on the planning process for fracking sites should they reach the actual hydraulic production stage. Hydraulic fracturing is a technique used to extract gas or oil by injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals, at high pressure, into the earth via drilled boreholes. The water mixture opens up cracks in the rock and the sand lodges into the spaces to keep them open, allowing for the release of gas. The government's proposals, for permitted development, would only apply to non-hydraulic shale gas exploration. This works without the use of fluid pressure but allows companies to drill for core samples. However, many argue that even exploration sites can cause considerable disruption to local communities. The government is looking at whether such applications could be included in something known as the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects regime or NSIPs. Think major new roads, railway lines and airports. NSIPs typically see a Planning Inspector present a report and recommendations to the relevant Secretary of State. Local councils get to ""inform"" the decision, but they certainly don't get to make it.Given the government's much-trumpeted commitment to ""localism"", the irony has not been lost on Conservative MPs. East Yorkshire's Sir Greg Knight said: ""If the government is being consistent, shouldn't local communities have more say on fracking matters and not have their voice taken away?"" He was one of 10 Tory MPs to express concerns at this week's debate and there are more. Misgivings range from cautious scepticism to outright anger. North East Derbyshire is a marginal seat where a company recently won permission, through appeal, to look for shale gas. The constituency's Conservative MP, Lee Rowley, has described the government's proposals as ""ludicrous"", adding that, ""fracking in my view will not work in this country"". Ministers point to the fact that permitted development rights do contain exclusions and restrictions that can mitigate a development's impact. They also say that NSIPs do see local communities consulted at an early stage while councils can submit written representations during the examination process.  But there has been a hint this week, perhaps, of some political nervousness. On the back of two consultations, that many argued amounted to undermining local democracy, a third consultation has appeared all about ""strengthening community engagement""; specifically whether it should be compulsory for shale gas firms to consult communities at the pre-application stage. Planning Minister Kit Malthouse this week told MPs: ""We believe this could further strengthen the role local people play in the process."" But it's led to claims that the government is now ""all over the place"" on its fracking policy. Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron said: ""This is the most inconsistent, confusing thing that I've seen in all my 35 years in parliament.""The government's determination to explore the potential of fracking is based on the hope that it could deliver greater energy security, jobs and cheaper gas for consumers. There is also some considerable frustration at the sluggish, yet fraught, way in which shale gas applications can currently be processed at a local authority level. Energy minister Claire Perry has previously said it is ""a morass of protest and counter-prevailing information and frankly I pity any local councillor that gets an application on their desk because they will shortly have a travelling circus of protestors most of whom do not hail from the areas where those sites are located.""  Ministers do insist that they remain fully committed to ensuring that local communities are properly involved in any application whilst also ensuring that the process is sped up. However, when it comes to controversial shale gas schemes, there is a real question over whether those two aims can easily be reconciled. And also whether the government can contain the evident displeasure and disquiet amongst some of its own MPs. "

2018-11-04,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

2018-11-04,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."
2018-11-04,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46034136,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: People on the lowest incomes benefit most from Monday's Budget.Reality Check verdict: The Treasury has not published analysis of whether this Budget will help the richest or poorest the most. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

But other areas of health spending run by the Department of Health will fall in 2019-20, according to a think tank. Government sources indicated that there were other revenues of income to boost Department of Health funding, including immigrant surcharges, which could be spent on services outside NHS England.The Health Foundation think tank has analysed the Budget paperwork and says that while the NHS England budget for day-to-day running costs will rise by nearly £4bn in real terms next year, there will be a reduction of £1bn, or 12%, in other areas of the health budget.This slice of funding covers prevention initiatives run by Public Health England and local authorities, including smoking cessation and sexual health. It also includes the budget for Health Education England.The previous Chancellor, George Osborne, was criticised for announcing increases for NHS England while at the same time cutting allocations for public health and medical and nurse training.The Conservative chairwoman of the Health Select Committee, Sarah Wollaston, told the BBC any further cuts would be unacceptable: ""We cannot see money transferred from other parts of the Budget such as public health or training budgets to fund NHS England rises.  ""This would have serious consequences and undermine the commitments made to the NHS this summer.""Labour's Barbara Keeley said it was ""incredibly short-sighted given the workforce challenges in the NHS"".  Others argued that in the long run, it would cost the NHS far more if investment did not go into prevention and early intervention. Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation, said that ministers may have to resort to raiding budgets set aside for investment in NHS buildings and technology.""If the government wants to avoid further cuts to education and public health, it will need to shift all of the planned capital growth to day-to-day resource budgets,"" she said.A government source said that the numbers in the Budget did not include sources of income, including surcharges for immigrants, which could be passed on to areas like public health. In the past, health budgets in England have been propped up with money switched from investment known as capital spending (such as money for new buildings) and it's possible this will happen again next year.The budget for day-to-day running costs for NHS England is £114.6bn for 2018-19, and the equivalent overall budget for the Department of Health is £123.3bn."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-04,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, while remaining 15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.7%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 9.4% in June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The latest UK inflation figures have the rate at 2.7%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 244,000 in the year to September 2017. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
2018-11-04,Labour Party conference,https://web.archive.org//web/20181105021035/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45646690,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is ""ready"" to start work on a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"", Jeremy Corbyn has told his party conference in Liverpool.The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture that has dominated politics and ""kickstart a green jobs revolution"".""We represent the new common sense of our time,"" he told the Labour faithful.Mr Corbyn also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.But he said that Labour would oppose the PM's current plan ""or whatever is left of it"", and vowed to fight any move to leave the EU without a deal.Labour is hoping to force a general election if the final Brexit settlement is rejected by Parliament, and has not ruled out backing another referendum if one is not called.Mr Corbyn spoke for more than an hour, setting out his vision for a ""fairer society under Labour"" to enthusiastic support in the hall. ""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to £500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

It's true that it's an opportunity for change, if she and her colleagues can avoid damaging turmoil at the same time, if Brexit is not to become the kind of rather rude word her phrase tonight normally refers to. At the risk of writing what I have written on several occasions here before, we are at the stage in the talks where a deal could all suddenly come together.  Or it could all, as a couple of weeks ago, fall apart. Until the phone rings or WhatsApp buzzes to say it's suddenly on or off, here are a few pointers on the state of play.

2018-11-05,Ireland warns UK over post-Brexit border,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46091134,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"".The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides.With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side.The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence.The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland.It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states.There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland.But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place.There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK.Please upgrade your browserTory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point.Writing in The Sun, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come.Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"".This, however, is not the view of the EU.On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing.The Irish position remains consistent and v clear⁩ that a “time-limited backstop” or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by IRE or EU. These ideas are not backstops at all + don’t deliver on previous UK commitments ⁦⁦#Brexit pic.twitter.com/y7AQ8V1jMoEnd of Twitter post  by @simoncoveney""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand.And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement.""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said.Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"".While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea.The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed.Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end.""The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"".Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held.Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice.They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community.In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said.By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter.""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality.""The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016.A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU.""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said."
2018-11-05,Labour: 'No temporary customs union',https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46101243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour would vote against a government plan designed to resolve the impasse in the Brexit negotiations on Northern Ireland, the shadow chancellor said.John McDonnell has told Newsnight that Labour would reject any customs arrangement with the EU unless it was established on a permanent basis.Theresa May hopes to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland through a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement.Mrs May plans to have an agreement with EU leaders by the end of this month.Such a move from Labour would raise the chances of Parliament rejecting her withdrawal agreement.It is understood the prime minister believes that an agreement with EU leaders needs to be reached no later than the final week of November to allow it to pass parliamentary hurdles in Westminster and Strasbourg.That means a deal needs to be agreed with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier by around 21 November to give the EU a week to prepare for an emergency summit of EU leaders.Mrs May is due to brief the cabinet on Brexit on Tuesday morning. The prime minister's customs arrangement is known informally in No 10 as a customs union. Downing Street is facing calls from ministers for the UK to be allowed to end it unilaterally, a demand that has been rejected by the EU and Dublin.The No 10 initiative for an all-UK customs arrangement is designed to replace an EU proposal to create separate customs territories for Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The prime minister has rejected this on the grounds that it would lead to an internal UK border down the Irish Sea.Asked by Newsnight whether Labour could vote for a deal in which the whole of the UK was placed in a customs union with the EU for a temporary period, Mr McDonnell said: ""I can't see it because I think it would be the worst of all worlds. What I'm getting from business leaders, trade union leaders and others is they want permanence, they want stability.""Labour, which has advocated UK membership of a customs union for the past year, has said that it would vote down the prime minister's Brexit deal unless it passes six tests set by the party. These include delivering the ""exact same benefits"" as the UK enjoys as a member of the single market and the customs union.The shadow chancellor's remarks to Newsnight show that he wants permanent membership of a customs union to apply in all circumstances. This includes what is intended by No 10 to be a temporary ""backstop"" period after the end of the transition period in December 2020, if a future trading relationship has not been finalised by then.""If the government says 'well a customs union for a couple of years or maybe customs union until we decide there won't be one,' well actually, that doesn't give the stability for investment for anyone,"" McDonnell said.""What I'm worried about is Theresa May comes back from Europe waving a piece of paper - and it won't be Winston Churchill, it'll be more like Neville Chamberlain. What we'll see is peace in our time that will then disintegrate over time.""I'd rather she just came back and told us. If she can get a deal that protects jobs and the economy we'll vote for it, but it can't be half in half out. ""If she can't deliver, we can't vote for it - move to one side and let us do the negotiations.""The shadow chancellor indicated that if Parliament rejects a Brexit deal proposed by Theresa May, the EU might be prepared to renegotiate with a new UK government. Labour believes that if Parliament votes down a Brexit deal a general election should be held.""All the messages that we get back over this whole period is that our European partners desperately want what we want: a deal that will protect their jobs and their economies in the same way that we want to,"" he said.""If they recognise the deal is unacceptable to Parliament I think that opens up a vista of the opportunity of real negotiations... In the EU you negotiate on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect. You don't negotiate on the basis of banging on the table, threatening to walk out every five minutes.""Watch the full interview on Newsnight on Monday, 22:30 on BBC Two or online. "
2018-11-05,'Press reset' to win back overseas students,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46098699,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOverseas student numbers are ""flatlining"" and the government must ""press reset"" to tempt them back, says a cross-party group of MPs and Lords. International students bring huge benefits, but restrictive policies mean they increasingly go to the US, Canada or Australia, says the report. A key recommendation is to remove students from immigration targets. This contradicts a recent Migration Advisory Committee report which found no clear case for such a change. However, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for International Students argues that the UK has few greater assets than its education system, which delivers prosperity and opportunity across the regions and nations of the UK. ""The desire to study in our universities, colleges and schools has made us second only to the US as a destination of choice, bringing billions in export earnings and enormous influence,"" argue the group's co chairmen Paul Blomfield MP and Lord Bilimoria in their foreword to the report.International students who choose the UK provide the opportunity for UK students to study in a multinational classroom and ""bring vitality and tremendous cultural contributions to our campuses and communities"", they add. But they warn that in recent years, international student recruitment has fallen victim to the wider debate on migration, and efforts to create a ""hostile environment"".In particular, the report says, measures like the ending of post-study work visas in 2012 have contributed to international students opting for competitor countries. ""For too long, the drive to reduce net migration has trumped the growth of our world-class education system. ""Our campuses, local economies and global standing are suffering as a result.""Proposals to reverse ""this self-defeating course"" include: Former Education Secretary and APPG member Nicky Morgan, added that the impact of international students was seen in every constituency in the UK, ""as an economic, cultural and social benefit"". ""This report is a blueprint for ensuring that benefit remains and grows for the foreseeable future,"" she added. In a statement, the government promised to consider the APPG report carefully, alongside the recommendations of the Migration Advisory Committee. ""We recognise the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK and our world-class higher education system. ""That's why there is no limit on the number of international students who can come to study in the UK."" The spokeswoman pointed out that graduates are currently eligible to stay in the UK if they get graduate level jobs or internships, or apply to set up business here. Completing PhD students can stay an extra year to set up as entrepreneurs or to gain work experience.  "
2018-11-05,Benefit penalty scheme 'pointlessly cruel',https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46104333,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government must urgently reassess its ""pointlessly cruel"" benefit sanctions, a committee of MPs has said.Benefit sanctions are penalties imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings.The Work and Pensions Committee found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were ""disproportionately vulnerable"" to, and affected by, sanctions.The Department for Work and Pensions insisted its scheme was ""reasonable"".A DWP spokesman added that sanctions were ""only used in the minority of cases"". However, the committee's report stated the human cost of the current system was ""too high"".As well as missing appointments, sanctions can be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose 100% of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance.In some ""higher level"" cases - such as a failure to take up paid work - claimants can lose benefits for as long as three years. The committee's report recommended the maximum period for such sanctions should be two months for the first failure to comply and four to six months for subsequent breaches.It also warned that children risked becoming ""collateral damage"" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare.Without clear evidence that sanctions were driving a return to work by single parents, it was ""hard to justify"" their inclusion in the system, the report said.The committee received more than 500 responses detailing claimants' experience of the sanctions regime, which included cases of ""extreme hardship and distress"".These included a wheelchair user who ""sofa-surfed"" with friends or slept in a college library for a year when her entire benefit was wrongly taken away.And the committee heard from a man who was sanctioned when he missed a job centre appointment three days after being taken to hospital suffering from severe epileptic seizures.Frank Field, who chairs the committee, said he had heard accounts of ""terrible and unnecessary hardship"" from people who had been sanctioned.The committee said that ministers had ""no idea"" how many people were suffering as a result of the sanctions regime, because of an ""unacceptable"" failure to adequately evaluate its impact."
2018-11-05,MP warns of 'Jimmy Savile situation',https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46105210,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA Labour MP has urged action to prevent a ""Jimmy Savile situation"" developing in Parliament.Jess Phillips said MPs, staff members, and others should be allowed to log concerns to allow patterns to show up and avoid suspicions being ignored.The suggestion came during a debate on Dame Laura Cox's report into bullying.A 2016 review found an ""atmosphere of fear"" at the BBC meant opportunities to stop ""monstrous"" abuse by DJ Jimmy Savile were missed.The Dame Janet Smith review identified 72 victims of Savile and 21 victims of broadcaster Stuart Hall, over five decades from 1959.She said BBC culture ""was deeply deferential"" and staff were reluctant to speak to managers about complaints.Ms Phillips told MPs she had received ""some harrowing reports"" of behaviour by people in the House of Commons from people she knew ""won't ever come forward"".""I do think there needs to be some system so we don't end up in a Jimmy Savile situation where everybody says 'Well, we all knew, oh everybody knew he was a bit like that, oh yeah, course he was'.""We need a place where Members of Parliament - in fact, members of staff, anybody who is around this place - can without prejudice log that somewhere so that we can show patterns.""A scathing report last month by High Court judge Dame Laura Cox found lewd, aggressive and intimidating behaviour by MPs and senior staff had been ""tolerated and concealed"" for years.The Commons authorities are expected to set up an independent body, outside the control of MPs, to examine all cases.Meanwhile, ministers are reportedly considering a new bullying probe.Speaker John Bercow, who has denied allegations of bullying levelled against him, had been expected to chair the debate on Dame Laura's report but opted to allow two of his deputies to officiate instead.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said there needed to be a change to the ""power balance"" in the Commons, give staff a strong voice and work out how to stop ""failures at the top infecting our entire workplace"".A new Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme had so far received a total of 51 calls and a ""small number of investigations into complaints"" were under way, she told MPs.Maria Miller, who chairs the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, said: ""The problems run deeper than just the abuse itself, but the dismissive way in which allegations are handled has created a toxic lack of trust in senior management.""SNP frontbencher Alison Thewliss said: ""I've no doubt that the ingrained masculine culture in this institution is a key factor in the shocking cases of bullying and harassment that have been brought to the attention of this House. This behaviour has got to stop.""Conservative MP Philip Davies, meanwhile, suggested the Commons should seek advice on how to change its culture from supermarket giant Asda.The Shipley MP, who worked at Asda before he became an MP, said: ""One of the best culture changes I ever saw and ever experienced was during my time at Asda.""They completely transformed the very hierarchical culture in that organisation.""The MP also defended Mr Bercow, saying the bullying debate should not be used as a ""witch hunt or an attempt to settle old scores""."

The opposition has consistently called on the government to stop the rollout but this government is pressing ahead despite the terrible hardship it is causing.""Birkenhead MP Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, welcomed the extra cash Ms McVey had ""managed to claw back from the Treasury"".But SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said people were ""still worse off"" as the benefit freeze and sanctions regime were still in place.And Labour MP Jess Phillips raised concerns over a Birmingham Yardley constituent who had to move after being raped and was ""forced"" on to universal credit as a result.""She works, she has always worked, she is £200 worse off - she is a single mother,"" said Ms Phillips.""What is being offered to her today, and which is why we're not supporting it, is still going to be £160 a month worse for her.""A rape victim, single mother, in work - what will she do for her?""Ms McVey said she would like to meet Ms Phillips to discuss the woman's case.

2018-11-05,Hammond denies abandoning deficit target,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46100077,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK's chancellor has rejected suggestions he has abandoned a target to eliminate the budget deficit by the middle of the next decade.Questions over Philip Hammond's commitment to the target were raised after his Budget last week which promised a big increase in spending.But he told the Treasury Committee on Monday that the target, set in autumn 2016, ""hasn't been abandoned"".There would, though, be a ""balanced approach"" to cutting the deficit.That ""balance"" meant weighing up the need to get borrowing down alongside other priorities like cutting taxes and raising public spending.But Mr Hammond told the MPs that this trade-off was nothing new. ""I have said since the autumn of 2016 that I would take a balanced approach,"" he said.This involved ""recognising the need to reduce and ultimately eliminate the deficit in order to get debt falling sustainably - something we have now achieved - but also the need to support our public services, keep taxes low and, crucially, to invest in infrastructure, skills, training, research and development and support the future productivity of our country"", he said.""That is the only way we are going to get sustainable real growth in incomes and rising living standards over the medium term.""Mr Hammond's Budget spending rise was seen by many commentators as marking ""the end of austerity"". But it also sparked debate about whether the chancellor could now balance the nation's books by the middle of next decade. The director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank, Paul Johnson, said last week: ""Any idea that there is a serious desire to eliminate the deficit by the mid-2020s is surely for the birds.""On Monday, Mr Hammond said he and Prime Minister Theresa May had made clear that ending austerity did not simply mean loosening the purse-strings in the public sector.""From our point of view, austerity is not only a measure of public sector spending, it also refers to broader issues,"" he said.""As austerity comes to an end, I would want to see our public services being financed more generously than they were over the period of fiscal consolidation,"" he told the committee."
2018-11-05,£2 stake 'spells end for terrible machines',https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46095851,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCutting the maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to £2 will virtually ""eliminate"" these ""terrible machines"", Chancellor Philip Hammond has said.He told MPs the move should be a ""cause for celebration"" for campaigners such as ex-sports minister Tracey Crouch who quit over the issue last week.He rejected claims its introduction was being delayed to protect tax revenues.But he said thousands of people could lose their jobs as High Street bookies closed and ""time to adjust"" was needed. Ms Crouch resigned from her post last week after it was announced the £2 stake would come into force in October 2019, rather than April as she believed it would. Appearing before the Treasury select committee, Mr Hammond said in agreeing to the £2 stake, the government had adopted the ""most extreme"" version of the options that had been proposed.The move, he claimed, was a victory for campaigners such as Ms Crouch who wanted to ""get rid"" of the machines from High Streets up and down the country. Asked why, in this case, Ms Crouch had resigned, he replied ""you will have to ask her"". He said the October deadline for making the change was a ""sensible compromise between different interests"" given it would lead to ""very significant"" consequences for the betting industry, in terms of job losses.But the Tory MP who chairs the committee, Nicky Morgan, said an impact assessment had signalled it would be introduced by May 2019 at the latest and the chancellor was picking ""an unnecessary fight"" with MPs.Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette in High Street bookmakers shops. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry and taxes of £400m for the government but anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems.In the fallout from her resignation, Ms Crouch has suggested Conservative backbencher Philip Davies and other MPs who support the betting industry had been ""more persuasive in their arguments"" to senior ministers. She was asked on Sunday about a newspaper report suggesting she believed a meeting between Mr Davies and Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Wright was key to the alleged delay.She refused to confirm the details of the report, saying: ""All meetings are registered. I'm sure it will all come out anyway.""Mr Davies told BBC Radio 5 Live's Stephen Nolan it was wrong to suggest he had influenced the decision and Mr Wright, when they met, told him he was ""minded to introduce the reduction in stake in 2019"".""I merely pointed out to him that as far as I was concerned, I wasn't wanting him to delay it. I was pointing out to him that the decision had already been taken to implement the decision in 2020.""He questioned the rationale behind the £2 stake and suggested the Gambling Commission, the government agency that regulates betting, did not believe it was necessary to address the harm caused by the machines.""I've spoken to the Gambling Commission and I know what their view is. They thought it should be cut to £30.""I am not going to drop anybody in it but I have had discussions with with the Gambling Commission and I know for a fact they do not see any justification or didn't see any at the time for reducing the stake to £2.""In its final submission to government on the issue in March, the regulator recommended a maximum stake of £2 for slot games and a figure of £30 or below for non-slot games such as roulette.Mr Davies suggested its wording had been designed to make it easier for the government to move to a £2 figure across the board. ""They put ""or below"" to try and help the government out with the decision it had taken,"" he added.The Gambling Commission said its advice was based on the ""best available evidence"".It believed a minimum stake of £30 or less was needed for there to be a ""significant effect on the potential for players to lose large amounts of money in a short space of time"". Mr Davies is the MP who has received the most free tickets to sporting events from betting firms since the 2017 general election, according to a BBC analysis of the register of members' interests. He was hosted at 13 horse racing events by Ladbrokes Coral, William Hill and Sky Bet, which also offered him free tickets to the 2017 League One play-off between Millwall and Bradford City. The total value of the tickets was £5,759.Of the 16 MPs who accepted hospitality from the betting industry over the period, nine were Labour MPs, six Conservative and one SNP."

""For a Member of Parliament to maintain the employment of someone convicted of such a crime turns a blind eye to the damaging consequences of such behaviour and seriously brings the integrity of Parliament into disrepute."" Ishmael Osamor was caught trying to take ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and cannabis into a festival in August 2017 - nine months before he was elected as a councillor.As part of his sentence, he was ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, attend 20 days rehabilitation and pay £400 prosecution costs.Following his conviction Osamor resigned from his cabinet post on Haringey Council and later resigned as a councillor following pressure from opposition groups."

It said: ""The MoD currently estimates the plan - which includes the development of four new submarines to carry the UK's Trident nuclear deterrent - will cost £193.3bn against a budget of £186.4bn, a shortfall of £7bn.""Commons Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said the MoD ""needs to be clear about what equipment they will or will not be funding.""Jonathan Beale, defence correspondentThe NAO has been warning the MoD that its equipment programme is ""unaffordable"". But for the first time, the Ministry of Defence itself now acknowledges that there's a gap in its budget of at least £7bn. The NAO says that could easily double over the next 10 years unless urgent action is taken. It says that means deciding as soon as possible which equipment programmes should be delayed or even scrapped. The chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, Meg Hillier, also warns that the  extra £1bn for defence announced in last week's Budget won't be enough to plug the gap. The Labour MP says the MoD - which has still to complete a long awaited defence review - is in real danger of wasting taxpayers' money through short-term decisions.Auditor general Sir Amyas Morse said the defence department's 10-year equipment plan ""shows that the MoD has a clearer understanding of the affordability that it faces"", but added that action was required ""urgently"".An MoD spokesman said the department strived ""to ensure our military have the very best ships, aircraft and vehicles through our £186bn plan"".He added the Treasury has guaranteed an extra £1bn to boost the UK's defences in Chancellor Philip Hammond's most recent budget.This is alongside an £800m increase given to the government department in the summer. In June the Commons Defence Committee said the UK needed to increase the defence budget by £20bn to maintain influence with Washington and Nato allies."

She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-05,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce.

2018-11-05,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-05,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-05,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181106051919/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

""When we meet this time next year let it be as a Labour government. Investing in Britain after years of austerity and neglect and bringing our country together after a decade of division,"" he told delegates, to cheers.He told them ""the old way of running things isn't working anymore"" and Labour's better-than-expected election result last year showed voters were ready for something new.""Ten years ago this month, the whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences.""But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place.""People in this country know - they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isn't working any more."" AnalysisThe Labour conference is more at ease with itself this year, and this speech was designed to show the rest of the country that that party has solid, credible, worked-out answers for the questions of the day.Scepticism about his programme still runs far and wide in the parliamentary party at Westminster.But this Liverpool gathering has more or less, despite tensions over the EU, shown that Labour has moved on from the turmoil when Mr Corbyn first took over.Party conferences are always a shop window for leaders to show their wares to the rest of the country.Read more from LauraLabour members voted on Tuesday to keep all options on the table - including a fresh referendum - if there is no Brexit deal with Brussels.Mr Corbyn said in his speech he would support Theresa May on Brexit - if she got a ""sensible"" deal that included a customs union that prevented the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland and protected workers' rights.He said Labour would vote against the PM's Chequers plan ""or whatever is left of it"" and oppose leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would be a ""national disaster"".But he told Mrs May: ""If you deliver a deal that includes a customs union and no hard border in Ireland, if you protect jobs, people's rights at work and environmental and consumer standards - then we will support that sensible deal. ""A deal that would be backed by most of the business world and trade unions too.""But if you can't negotiate that deal then you need to make way for a party that can and will.""This call, delivered with venom by Mr Corbyn, went down well in the hall. Delegates gave their leader a standing ovation and there was an outbreak of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"".Mrs May has consistently ruled out a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The Labour leader also used his speech to announce plans to create 400,000 skilled jobs with new investment in fresh wind farms and insulation for homes.He pointed to Labour's commitment to reduce the UK's net carbon emissions by 60% by 2030 - and to zero by 2050.Labour's energy plans would ""make Britain the only developed country outside Scandinavia to be on track to meet our climate change obligations"", said Mr Corbyn.And they would bring ""skills and security to communities held back for too long"", in all parts of the UK.Turning to the row over anti-Semitism in Labour, Mr Corbyn said it had caused ""immense hurt and anxiety"" and there was a standing ovation as he told Jewish people: ""We are your ally.""Being anti-racist was ""integral to our very being"", he went on, adding that he would not accept being accused of anti-Semitism by ""Tory hypocrites"", criticising the government's ""hostile environment"" immigration policies and MEPs' ""support"" for the Hungarian government of Viktor Orban.On foreign policy, Mr Corbyn said evidence ""now points clearly to the Russian state"" as being responsible for the Salisbury poisoning and promised ""no more reckless wars of intervention"" like those in Iraq and Libya.And he condemned the actions of Israeli forces in Gaza, calling for a ""secure Israel and a viable and secure Palestinian state"".Labour would recognise a Palestinian state as soon as it takes office, he said, ""in order to help make that two-state settlement a reality"".Earlier in his speech, to applause in the arena, he attacked parts of the British press, saying billionaire newspapers owners did not like Labour ""one little bit"".He called on supporters to challenge their ""propaganda of privilege"", using ""the mass media of the 21st century"" - social media.Freedom of the press must be protected, he said: ""But here, a free press has far too often meant the freedom to spread lies and half-truths, and to smear the powerless, not take on the powerful.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would put ""fairness and humanity"" back into public services, pointing to pledges to increase the number of police officers and expand free childcare.Labour has used its week in Liverpool to announce a string of new policies, building on those contained in its 2017 general election manifesto.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell unveiled plans to force large companies to give staff 1% of their shares a year, netting them up to £500 a year each.He also set out plans to ""democratise"" the economy by renationalising the water industry, which he said would hand power to workers, consumers and local councils. Further nationalisations - of the rail, mail and energy industries - would follow under a Labour government.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the speech showed Mr Corbyn ""was unfit to govern"" and would ""open the door to re-running the referendum"".The SNP said the Scottish government was already delivering on issues mentioned in the speech such as tough climate change targets, a publicly-owned bid to run Scotland's railways and free sanitary products in schools.And Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn must listen to his party members and support the campaign to stop Brexit. The CBI business group's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said there was ""much common ground between business and Labour"" but warned that ""continual public barbs and backward-facing policy are deterring entrepreneurs and investors, at a time when we need them most"".Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: ""That speech was inspiring. We heard a Labour leader draw a very clear line under the failed policies of the past, policies that have caused despair and division in our communities, and then set out a distinctive, different, positive Labour programme for the country.""The British Chambers of Commerce said there were some ""bright spots"" but ""Jeremy Corbyn missed a golden opportunity to extend an olive branch to British business""."

Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister assured ministers that the cabinet would meet before the UK agreed to any deal on the terms of the UK's exit. The withdrawal deal is said to be 95% complete but the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland.There is disagreement on whether this ""backstop"" should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it should be time-limited or revoked by the UK.At the cabinet meeting it is understood ministers discussed the mechanism for governing the backstop and who should decide when it no longer applied.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to have set out the legal position for an independent review mechanism for the backstop.He is believed to have told ministers there is a legal ""spectrum"" of what is possible to prevent the UK from being trapped ""in limbo"".The Irish border is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states.EU negotiator Michel Barnier told a Belgian broadcaster that the Irish border remained the main hurdle to be overcome but if enough progress is made he would recommend that a summit is convened to finalise the deal.Meanwhile, the government has published the criteria for allocating scarce permits for British truckers who need to drive in the EU after Brexit.The permits will be shared out based on: vehicle emissions, number of international journeys in the previous year, number of international journeys as a percentage of all journeys, type of goods transported and an element of chance.The Department for Transport document says the permits would be required for a no deal scenario BUT might also be required after the future economic partnership is agreed, depending on the type of deal."

So what?""The UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.Since then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data.For its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to ""micro target"" voters.The ICO said this had been the ""most complex data protection investigation"" it had ever carried out, with ""an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public"".It said it had uncovered a ""disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy"".The investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts.The ICO said it had identified ""serious breaches of data protection principles"" and would have issued a ""substantial fine"" if the company had not already been in administration.The report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum.It said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a ""view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes"", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned.Elsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance.Both organisations face fines of £60,000 for emails which breached data laws.The ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent.It also imposed a £15,000 fine for a separate ""serious"" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database.A final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data.Vote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ.The ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws.It said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had ""transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects"".But it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered ""electronic marketing communications"" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules.""We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,"" it added.The ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign.This includes looking at ""the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker"", as well as ""inadequate third party consents"", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said.It also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about £100,000.This was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign.""We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,"" the report added.The ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be ""transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process"".""We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,"" it said.""But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.""The ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet.Although its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.The watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning. Specifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained.In addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice ""enshrined by law"" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used. The regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data. It said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies.As a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed."
2018-11-06,Benefit penalty scheme 'pointlessly cruel',https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46104333,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government must urgently reassess its ""pointlessly cruel"" benefit sanctions, a committee of MPs has said.Benefit sanctions are penalties imposed on claimants who do not meet conditions such as attending job centre meetings.The Work and Pensions Committee found single parents, care leavers and people with disabilities and health conditions were ""disproportionately vulnerable"" to, and affected by, sanctions.The Department for Work and Pensions insisted its scheme was ""reasonable"".A DWP spokesman added that sanctions were ""only used in the minority of cases"". However, the committee's report stated the human cost of the current system was ""too high"".As well as missing appointments, sanctions can be imposed for failure to show efforts to find work, and can see claimants lose 100% of their jobseeker's allowance or universal credit standard allowance.In some ""higher level"" cases - such as a failure to take up paid work - claimants can lose benefits for as long as three years. The committee's report recommended the maximum period for such sanctions should be two months for the first failure to comply and four to six months for subsequent breaches.It also warned that children risked becoming ""collateral damage"" as the withdrawal of parents' benefits harmed their welfare.Without clear evidence that sanctions were driving a return to work by single parents, it was ""hard to justify"" their inclusion in the system, the report said.The committee received more than 500 responses detailing claimants' experience of the sanctions regime, which included cases of ""extreme hardship and distress"".These included a wheelchair user who ""sofa-surfed"" with friends or slept in a college library for a year when her entire benefit was wrongly taken away.And the committee heard from a man who was sanctioned when he missed a job centre appointment three days after being taken to hospital suffering from severe epileptic seizures.Frank Field, who chairs the committee, said he had heard accounts of ""terrible and unnecessary hardship"" from people who had been sanctioned.The committee said that ministers had ""no idea"" how many people were suffering as a result of the sanctions regime, because of an ""unacceptable"" failure to adequately evaluate its impact."

""So I've asked these new councils to advise us on the opportunities and challenges facing business as we shape the UK for the future.""The co-chairs will be at Downing Street on Wednesday to thrash out their forthcoming agendas and meetings timetables.Executives from BT, BAE, Rolls-Royce, Prudential, Santander, Tesco, Timpson, ITV and GSK will be in attendance, as well as representatives from the CBI, IOD, EEF, and FSB business groups. Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems and co-chair of the committee looking at the industrial, manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, said: ""We are a vital part of the wealth creating machinery of the country where improved training, productivity and exporting will be the cornerstones of our global success. ""Engaging with the prime minister to tackle these issues in a focused and practical manner is a welcome and important step forward in achieving our collective growth ambitions.""Downing Street said the co-chairs would be responsible for preparing each council's agenda, ensuring all members were briefed and driving progress on major opportunities for their business sectors.The initiative comes days after more than 70 business figures signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal.The chief executive of Waterstones and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King were among those saying a ""destructive hard Brexit"" would damage the UK economy.A group called Business for a People's Vote will launch on Thursday.A Downing Street source told the BBC the Prime Minister was clear that there would be no new referendum.The government's overtures to business are rapidly becoming a symphony. After two years of feeling they were ""outside the tent"" when it came to Brexit strategy and policy, Theresa May is welcoming as many business big hitters back inside as she can. It's quite a change from 2016. One of first things Theresa May did when taking over from David Cameron was to disband his business council. The new prime minister and her advisers had watched voters, disillusioned with big business, ignore the Brexit warnings from industry and assessed that being seen as close to them was a political mistake. Fast forward to today's announcement that she is founding no fewer than FIVE new business councils to give ""regular, high level advice and policy recommendations"". Read Simon's full blog here"

2018-11-06,Ministers press ahead with probate fee rises,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46113896,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government is to press ahead with plans to substantially increase the cost to bereaved families of settling the estates of deceased relatives.At the moment, most people pay a flat fee of £155 for a court order giving executors the legal authority to administer the assets in an estate.It will be replaced by a sliding scale of fees linked to an estate's value, ranging from £250 to a £6,000 maximum.Critics warn it is a ""death tax"" but ministers say more estates won't pay.Ministers appeared to back off the changes to probate fees in England and Wales in the run-up to last year's general election, following criticism that it would disproportionately hit those inheriting family homes whose value has soared in recent years. But the Ministry of Justice said a revised system of payments would now come into force in April and contribute to the running of the courts and tribunal service.At the moment, people using solicitors pay a one-off fee of £155 to apply to the court for a grant of representation - a key step in the probate process - or £215 if they are applying in person. Under the proposed new system, estates valued at more than £2m will now pay £6,000, while those worth between £1.6m and £2m will pay £5,000 and those between £1m and £1.6m £4,000. The figure will fall to £2,500 for estates worth between £500,000 and £1m while those in the £50,000 to £300,000 price bracket will pay £250. Those valued at less than £50,000 will not pay anything.Ministers said they had listened to concerns expressed last year and had amended their original proposals. These would have seen a maximum fee of £20,000 on estates worth £2m or above, and estates valued at more than £1m paying a minimum of £8,000.The changes were not included in last week's Budget and will be enacted via secondary legislation later this month.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer said the move was justified to support the courts service, with the maximum fee to be charged representing no more than 0.5% of the value of an estate. By raising the level at which fees are payable from £5,000 to £50,000, she said 25,000 estates would not pay anything at all while 80% of estates would pay no more than £750.She rejected suggestions the fees would make the probate process unaffordable for executors, who are often the direct beneficiaries of an estate, such as the children of the deceased. She said they would be able to ""recover"" the fees from the proceeds of the estate and would have a number of options as to how to pay them.""This new banded fee model represents a fair and more progressive way to pay for probate services compared to the current flat fee, and reflects our commitment to protecting access to justice by ensuring we have a properly funded and resourced courts system,"" Ms Frazer said.Property accounts for the bulk of the financial value of assets in most estates, which are already liable for inheritance tax. Probate lawyers have argued the fee rises are effectively a tax raid on high-value homes, since there is little difference in the amount of work involved in administering estates of different value.The Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners said 85% of estates would have been liable for higher fees, based on 2014-5 figures.""The new charges bear no relation to the cost of probate, and are simply another form of taxation, sneaked in through the back door,"" said its chief executive George Hodgson. ""The government has failed to explain why it is choosing to place this burden on bereaved families, many of whom will have spent months or years paying expensive care fees for their elderly relatives."""

2018-11-06,Landmark day for state pension equality,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46101343,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFrom Tuesday women in the UK will begin to qualify for their state pensions at the same age as men - currently 65.The move to equalise male and female pension ages began 25 years ago, under John Major's government, and has been gradually phased in.Women who are 65 on 6 November will therefore be the first to wait for as long as men.But critics say that women are still a long way from pension equality, as the amount they typically receive is lower.For more than 60 years - up until 2010 - women received their pensions at the age of 60, but that has been rising ever since.From now on, men and women will see their state pension ages go up in tandem - increasing to 66 by October 2020, and 67 by 2028.The government has also accepted the findings of the Cridland review, which recommended that the pension age should rise further - to 68 - by 2039.The move to increase the state pension age is the result of increasing longevity.A girl born in 1951 had a life expectancy of 82 years. A girl born today can expect to reach the age of 93.Over the same period, boys' life expectancy has increased from 77 years to 90.State pension calculator - check your age and entitlementSuccessive governments have accepted that unless the qualifying age went up, the state pension would become unaffordable.The changes have therefore saved the Treasury at least £30bn.""No-one wants to be told they have to work longer into their 60s - or even their 70s - before they'll get their state pension, but that is the inevitable consequence of rising longevity,"" said Nathan Long at Hargreaves Lansdown.Others have warned that even though their state pension ages may now be the same, men and women are still far from equal when it comes to pensions.Figures from a Parliamentary briefing document show that in 2017 the average woman's state pension was worth £126 a week, compared with the average man's at £154. However these exclude claims for Pension Credit, which has more female recipients than male.Women typically earn less from their state pension than men, as they tend to work in more lowly-paid and part-time jobs and therefore pay lower National Insurance Contributions.Some who take time off work to have a family fail to claim National Insurance Credits.Former pensions minister Ros Altmann said women lose out on workplace and private pensions as well.Many with part-time jobs miss out on auto-enrolment pensions, for example, as they do not earn enough to qualify.""Women in their 50s and older have lost out most, but younger women face penalties too, as all pensions - state, workplace and private pensions - discriminate against women,"" she said.""Some of the inequalities date back many decades, but others are new problems created by recent legislation.""Full timetable of pension age changesWomen Against State Pension Age Inequality (WASPI) said they would continue their campaign to win compensation for those who were unaware that their state pension age was going to rise.""Equalisation is not just about the age you reach retirement, but also your ability to generate a full state pension entitlement, and pay into a private pension, to have any hope of security in retirement,"" said Debbie de Spon, a spokesperson for WASPI."
2018-11-06,Labour: 'No temporary customs union',https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46101243,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour would vote against a government plan designed to resolve the impasse in the Brexit negotiations on Northern Ireland, the shadow chancellor said.John McDonnell has told Newsnight that Labour would reject any customs arrangement with the EU unless it was established on a permanent basis.Theresa May hopes to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland through a temporary UK-wide customs arrangement.Mrs May plans to have an agreement with EU leaders by the end of this month.Such a move from Labour would raise the chances of Parliament rejecting her withdrawal agreement.It is understood the prime minister believes that an agreement with EU leaders needs to be reached no later than the final week of November to allow it to pass parliamentary hurdles in Westminster and Strasbourg.That means a deal needs to be agreed with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier by around 21 November to give the EU a week to prepare for an emergency summit of EU leaders.Mrs May is due to brief the cabinet on Brexit on Tuesday morning. The prime minister's customs arrangement is known informally in No 10 as a customs union. Downing Street is facing calls from ministers for the UK to be allowed to end it unilaterally, a demand that has been rejected by the EU and Dublin.The No 10 initiative for an all-UK customs arrangement is designed to replace an EU proposal to create separate customs territories for Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The prime minister has rejected this on the grounds that it would lead to an internal UK border down the Irish Sea.Asked by Newsnight whether Labour could vote for a deal in which the whole of the UK was placed in a customs union with the EU for a temporary period, Mr McDonnell said: ""I can't see it because I think it would be the worst of all worlds. What I'm getting from business leaders, trade union leaders and others is they want permanence, they want stability.""Labour, which has advocated UK membership of a customs union for the past year, has said that it would vote down the prime minister's Brexit deal unless it passes six tests set by the party. These include delivering the ""exact same benefits"" as the UK enjoys as a member of the single market and the customs union.The shadow chancellor's remarks to Newsnight show that he wants permanent membership of a customs union to apply in all circumstances. This includes what is intended by No 10 to be a temporary ""backstop"" period after the end of the transition period in December 2020, if a future trading relationship has not been finalised by then.""If the government says 'well a customs union for a couple of years or maybe customs union until we decide there won't be one,' well actually, that doesn't give the stability for investment for anyone,"" McDonnell said.""What I'm worried about is Theresa May comes back from Europe waving a piece of paper - and it won't be Winston Churchill, it'll be more like Neville Chamberlain. What we'll see is peace in our time that will then disintegrate over time.""I'd rather she just came back and told us. If she can get a deal that protects jobs and the economy we'll vote for it, but it can't be half in half out. ""If she can't deliver, we can't vote for it - move to one side and let us do the negotiations.""The shadow chancellor indicated that if Parliament rejects a Brexit deal proposed by Theresa May, the EU might be prepared to renegotiate with a new UK government. Labour believes that if Parliament votes down a Brexit deal a general election should be held.""All the messages that we get back over this whole period is that our European partners desperately want what we want: a deal that will protect their jobs and their economies in the same way that we want to,"" he said.""If they recognise the deal is unacceptable to Parliament I think that opens up a vista of the opportunity of real negotiations... In the EU you negotiate on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect. You don't negotiate on the basis of banging on the table, threatening to walk out every five minutes.""Watch the full interview on Newsnight on Monday, 22:30 on BBC Two or online. "
2018-11-06,Ireland warns UK over post-Brexit border,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46091134,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"".The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides.With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side.The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence.The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland.It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states.There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland.But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place.There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK.Please upgrade your browserTory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point.Writing in The Sun, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come.Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"".This, however, is not the view of the EU.On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing.""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand.And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement.""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said.Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"".While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea.The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed.Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end.""The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"".Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held.Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice.They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community.In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said.By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter.""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality.""The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016.A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU.""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said."
2018-11-06,'Press reset' to win back overseas students,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46098699,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOverseas student numbers are ""flatlining"" and the government must ""press reset"" to tempt them back, says a cross-party group of MPs and Lords. International students bring huge benefits, but restrictive policies mean they increasingly go to the US, Canada or Australia, says the report. A key recommendation is to remove students from immigration targets. This contradicts a recent Migration Advisory Committee report which found no clear case for such a change. However, the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for International Students argues that the UK has few greater assets than its education system, which delivers prosperity and opportunity across the regions and nations of the UK. ""The desire to study in our universities, colleges and schools has made us second only to the US as a destination of choice, bringing billions in export earnings and enormous influence,"" argue the group's co chairmen Paul Blomfield MP and Lord Bilimoria in their foreword to the report.International students who choose the UK provide the opportunity for UK students to study in a multinational classroom and ""bring vitality and tremendous cultural contributions to our campuses and communities"", they add. But they warn that in recent years, international student recruitment has fallen victim to the wider debate on migration, and efforts to create a ""hostile environment"".In particular, the report says, measures like the ending of post-study work visas in 2012 have contributed to international students opting for competitor countries. ""For too long, the drive to reduce net migration has trumped the growth of our world-class education system. ""Our campuses, local economies and global standing are suffering as a result.""Proposals to reverse ""this self-defeating course"" include: Former Education Secretary and APPG member Nicky Morgan, added that the impact of international students was seen in every constituency in the UK, ""as an economic, cultural and social benefit"". ""This report is a blueprint for ensuring that benefit remains and grows for the foreseeable future,"" she added. In a statement, the government promised to consider the APPG report carefully, alongside the recommendations of the Migration Advisory Committee. ""We recognise the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK and our world-class higher education system. ""That's why there is no limit on the number of international students who can come to study in the UK."" The spokeswoman pointed out that graduates are currently eligible to stay in the UK if they get graduate level jobs or internships, or apply to set up business here. Completing PhD students can stay an extra year to set up as entrepreneurs or to gain work experience.  "

At the risk of writing what I have written on several occasions here before, we are at the stage in the talks where a deal could all suddenly come together.

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-06,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

2018-11-06,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-06,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-06,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181107014302/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

Leaving the Cabinet Office, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told Sky News it was a ""great document"". The UK and the EU cannot agree on the precise arrangements to avoid new border checks in Northern Ireland.BBC Brussels correspondent Adam FlemingBrussels is more concerned about the form in which the backstop exists, not how it's exited from. The EU is exploring the concept of a UK-wide customs arrangement to deal with the Irish border issue. But some member states want extra guarantees on rules and regulations if they are to offer the UK quota-free and tariff-free access to the single market. Some question if it's legally possible to agree during the Brexit talks instead of in the detailed negotiations over the future relationship that will begin after exit day. Others fret that they're being kept in the dark by the EU negotiators. But Brussels is united on two issues: the ultimate insurance policy remains a Northern Ireland-only element to the backstop, and the UK can't decide to withdraw from it on its own. Both sides agreed to put in place a ""backstop"", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a frictionless border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.One option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border.But how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled.The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work."

2018-11-07,How Bercow keeps Keith Vaz's secrets,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46112355,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIn the 17th century, England had a problem with laws on sedition. MPs could not speak freely about the king's policies for fear of judges. To solve that problem, we adopted a special guard against tyranny: ""parliamentary privilege"". Now, John Bercow, speaker of the House of Commons, has invoked it to stop Newsnight getting information about the behaviour of the MP Keith Vaz.Readers may recall that we have reported extensively on how Mr Vaz's behaviour on committee trips abroad, paid for by the taxpayer, were the scene for some allegations of not following the rules of the House and bullying towards staff.Mr Vaz denies all such actions. But we wished to see what documentation existed from the administration of these trips. We cannot.This is because Mr Bercow has personally intervened and gone out of his way to bar Newsnight from asking the Information Commissioner or a judge to review the decision. We will not be able to overturn this decision, as journalists fought through the courts to get to see MPs' expenses.The core legal text here is the 1689 Bill of Rights. It states: ""the Freedome of Speech and Debates or Proceedings in Parlyament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or Place out of Parlyament.""The two Houses in Parliament should have what lawyers refer to as ""exclusive cognizance"" over their own affairs. Judges may not interfere in what parliament does.This is perhaps the most important legal change in England that came from the 1688-9 coup, dubbed by supporters ""the Glorious Revolution"", when James II was replaced by the Dutch prince William of Orange and his wife Princess Mary. It is an important constitutional principle.That is why MPs and peers can make allegations in the Commons or Lords without fear of libel law. When Lord Hain named Sir Philip Green as having obtained an injunction against the Daily Telegraph, he was deploying this right. Injunctions have no weight inside the walls of the debating chambers.The current legal position is that this privilege covers ""proceedings"". So members taking part by speaking in a debate or ""voting, giving notice of a motion, or presenting a petition or report from a committee..."" are protected by privilege.But it does not cover everything parliament does. And where there is a dispute between the courts and parliament, judges decide where to draw the lines.For example, in 2010, the Supreme Court had to rule on whether the act of claiming parliamentary expenses was the sort of thing privilege should cover. If claiming expenses were a ""proceeding"" of the House that the Bill of Rights should cover, as some of the accused claimed, a prosecution could not be brought for dishonesty in a court. But as one of the justices put it: ""I am accordingly satisfied that the prosecution does not infringe article nine of the Bill of Rights by impeaching or questioning the freedom of speech, the freedom of debates or the freedom of proceedings of the House or of its Members."" That is why I was struck by a recent decision by Mr Bercow. We applied under the Freedom of Information Act to get papers relating to Mr Vaz's trips abroad. Clerks raised concerns - denied by the Leicester MP - that Mr Vaz had not abided by all the rules for trips. We wanted to know if those concerns ever become formal complaints.If they did, did the liaison committee, which controls this process, do anything about it? This is clearly an area where, one could argue, the Freedom of Information Act should bite.If the administration of MPs' expenses is not covered by privilege, why should the administration of committee trips be? MPs are involved - but they oversaw expenses too. Could knowing which travel agent booked tickets for MPs be a route to power for a would-be tyrant? What is the threat to free speech?Some months ago, Mr Bercow personally made the argument that this paperwork was all covered by privilege. But I looked forward to a tribunal when this could be tested. Normally, this sort of determination can be referred to the Information Commissioner and then to the tribunals and courts to judge whether that finding is fair. My judgment is, if they did that, I had a reasonable chance of winning. I suspect Mr Bercow agreed. That would explain why he has now used an unusual personal power to block any appeals. This week, I was notified he has issued a ""certificate"" under section 34(3) of the Freedom of Information Act. This is, in effect, a personal release veto. These sorts of vetos are supposed to be used sparingly - an emergency reserve power to guard sacred spaces if courts get it wrong. That is because their use means I have no rights of appeal. The Information Commissioner's view is that, since the certificate is genuine, that is the the end of the matter. Any appeal to the tribunals will automatically be discarded. I can ask a judge to review his decision, but it would entail looking at a decision taken by a parliamentary officer. That would hit privilege from another direction. The net result is that the Speaker, who denies bullying, has made an order to hide information about the behaviour of his close personal friend, Keith Vaz, a man who also denies bullying - supposedly to protect MPs' freedom of speech.And then he has gone out of his way to use a personal veto to make sure no-one could even consider reviewing that questionable decision. You can understand why staff are so suspicious about whether MPs will ever let themselves be judged by outsiders when it comes to bullying and harassment. "

The BBC said Question Time panels ""are never fully confirmed until broadcast"". The National Crime Agency is investigating Mr Banks and his Leave.EU campaign for alleged offences committed during the 2016 EU referendum following information passed to them by the Electoral Commission.Mr Banks has denied any wrongdoing and insisted the £8m he loaned to Leave.EU was legitimate and came from his UK insurance businesses.He was challenged to explain where the money for his Brexit campaign came from during an interview on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme last Sunday. His appearance was criticised by a number of politicians who argued it was wrong to give such a high-profile platform to someone facing a criminal investigation. The BBC said the interview was in the public interest. It has since emerged that Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by Mr Banks are facing fines of £135,000 over breaches of data laws following an investigation into the misuse of personal data by political campaigns by the Information Commissioner's office.Current affairs discussion show Question Time is produced for the BBC by Mentorn Media. At the end of last week's show, Mr Dimbleby said ""believe it or not, at the moment at any rate, Arron Banks is going to be on the panel"" in two weeks' time. Mr Banks indicated on Twitter that he would not be appearing.

Sir Roger Carr, chairman of BAE Systems and co-chair of the committee looking at the industrial, manufacturing and infrastructure sectors, said: ""We are a vital part of the wealth creating machinery of the country where improved training, productivity and exporting will be the cornerstones of our global success. ""Engaging with the prime minister to tackle these issues in a focused and practical manner is a welcome and important step forward in achieving our collective growth ambitions.""Downing Street said the co-chairs would be responsible for preparing each council's agenda, ensuring all members were briefed and driving progress on major opportunities for their business sectors.The initiative comes days after more than 70 business figures signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal.The chief executive of Waterstones and former Sainsbury's boss Justin King were among those saying a ""destructive hard Brexit"" would damage the UK economy.A group called Business for a People's Vote will launch on Thursday.A Downing Street source said the prime minister was clear that there would be no new referendum.By Simon Jack, BBC business editor The government's overtures to business are rapidly becoming a symphony. After two years of feeling they were ""outside the tent"" when it came to Brexit strategy and policy, Theresa May is welcoming as many business big hitters back inside as she can. It's quite a change from 2016. One of first things Theresa May did when taking over from David Cameron was to disband his business council. The new prime minister and her advisers had watched voters, disillusioned with big business, ignore the Brexit warnings from industry and assessed that being seen as close to them was a political mistake. Fast forward to today's announcement that she is founding no fewer than FIVE new business councils to give ""regular, high level advice and policy recommendations"". Read Simon's full blog here"

The proposals included key speeches from Theresa May, and interventions from supportive business and foreign leaders.One of those mentioned, Labour Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, told the Today programme this was ""news to me"".The government dismissed the notes, saying: ""The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn't represent the government's thinking."""

""In the longer term, all future Scottish governments will need to respond to the pressures this creates.""Scottish migration minister Ben Macpherson said the country was ""in a very different demographic position compared to the rest of the UK"", saying Scotland needs ""a tailored approach to migration policy"".The UK government has opposed devolving powers over migration to Holyrood, or having a specific migration policy for Scotland.During a session at Holyrood in September, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told the committee ""the Scottish government has levers to influence demographics in Scotland"", such as housing, planning and skills policies.Given the parliament's block grant from Westminster is based on the overall population, she argued that there are protections in the fiscal framework against demographic changes. She said: ""The Scottish government is protected against risk with regard to population size relative to the tax take in both countries."""

Their lawyers are set to appeal at a hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice next Tuesday.A tragedy that shocked Wales' political class By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editorThe death of Carl Sargeant left his family grief-stricken and the Welsh Government and Labour party in crisis. Within six months Carwyn Jones had announced plans to stand down as first minister; his authority sapped away by a cycle of claim and counter-claim about his handling of Mr Sargeant's sacking. Those competing to replace him have all spoken of the need to heal the wounds within the Labour group of AMs and draw a line under a tragedy that shocked Wales' political class to the core.But that will be difficult, with the independent inquiry pending and with Mr Jones due to give evidence at the inquest into Mr Sargeant's death. And what of the wider questions that go beyond this tragedy? How do you treat allegations in a way that is fair to both the accused and accuser?And how can institutions create a culture and a complaints system that has the confidence of those they are supposed to protect?AMs marked the anniversary by holding a event in the assembly with his favourite snacks - chip butties and custard creams.The assembly's presiding officer, Elin Jones, paid the legislature's condolences to the son of Jack Sargeant and his family at the start of proceedings on Wednesday.In the Senedd Plaid Cymru AM Bethan Jenkins said: ""If you're up there listening to us, we are alright mate, but we will always remember you, and we will do justice to your legacy, but we miss you terribly here today.""Welsh Conservative assembly group leader Paul Davies said: ""The Sargeant family, the assembly, and the people of Wales are still waiting for answers surrounding his death and I hope that they come to light in a fair, legal, and transparent manner.""Plaid leader Adam Price said the anniversary will be ""focusing a lot of our minds on the terrible loss and trauma that his family would have gone through""."

2018-11-07,Should there be a tax on red meat?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46122227,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA ""meat tax"" could prevent almost 6,000 deaths per year in the UK, according to researchers, but should politicians be telling people what they can and can't eat?Scientists at the University of Oxford say governments should consider imposing price hikes on red meat - such as beef, lamb and pork - to reduce consumption.They say it would save lives and more than £700m in UK healthcare costs, according to new research.Various research has linked eating red meat to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. In 2015 the World Health Organization warned that processed meats, like bacon, sausages and ham, could cause cancer, while unprocessed red meat could also increase your risk.And eating lots of red meat doesn't just have an impact on your own health.Researchers at the University of Oxford said meat eaters were also increasing the burden on the health service and the economy, due to a loss of workforce from ill health. There is also a growing awareness of the environmental impact of eating red meat.The high levels of land and water use and carbon emissions associated with its production mean cutting down is one of the key ways individuals can help tackle climate change.Researchers say a meat tax could cut consumption of processed meat by about two portions per week in high-income countries. In the UK, the study suggests a tax of 14% on red meat and 79% of processed meat. This would mean the price of a 227g Tesco Sirloin Steak would increase from £3.80 to £4.33.And for a pack of eight pork sausages from Sainsbury's the price would increase from £1.50 to £2.69.Earlier this year the government introduced a sugar tax on soft drinks, meaning manufacturers have to pay a levy on high-sugar drinks. The tax has already had an effect, with some leading brands reducing the sugar content in their products to avoid the levy.But whether it means consumers buy fewer sugary drinks remains to be seen.The impact of charging 5p for single-use carrier bags suggests financial incentives can change behaviour.The number of plastic bags handed out by supermarkets in England has drastically decreased since the change was introduced. However the government has been less keen on the idea of a ""latte levy"" on disposable coffee cups.Ministers prefer the idea of shops offering discounts to customers bringing their own cups rather than an extra charge.Attempts by the government to tell people what to do don't always go down well. Christopher Snowdon, from the Institute for Economic Affairs, said taxing food was ""the next battleground for the nanny state"". Last month climate minister Claire Perry told BBC News it was not the government's place to tell people they can't eat steak and chips, despite the environmental impact. Mr Snowdon also argued it would be ""absurd"" to raise the cost of living through a meat tax. There's also the concern that it targets foods bought by those on lower incomes.Those advocating a meat and processed meat tax have not considered where the greatest impact would be. Those around the poverty line would likely be pushed further into poverty as a result.#PreventPoverty@GarethThomasMPEnd of Twitter post  by @innov8tor3And then there is the question of whether it would work.The cost of a fry-up would be more expensive, but would this actually discourage meat-lovers from buying their favourite foods?"

So what?""The UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016.Since then there have been several investigations looking at how the different campaigns were run, including into how they were funded and how they used personal data.For its report, the Information Commissioner has been looking at how political campaigns use personal data to ""micro target"" voters.The ICO said this had been the ""most complex data protection investigation"" it had ever carried out, with ""an abundance of claims and allegations played out in public"".It said it had uncovered a ""disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy"".The investigation was initially prompted by reports in The Observer about the activities of data firm Cambridge Analytica, which was accused of improperly harvesting millions of Facebook accounts.The ICO said it had identified ""serious breaches of data protection principles"" and would have issued a ""substantial fine"" if the company had not already been in administration.The report says that Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica did not pursue a working relationship once Leave.EU failed to obtain designation as the official leave campaign for the 2016 referendum.It said Leave.EU had explored creating a new organisation with a ""view to collecting and analysing large quantities of data for political purposes"", but there was no evidence this had ever functioned.Elsewhere in the report, it highlights what it says is the close relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance.Both organisations face fines of £60,000 for emails which breached data laws.The ICO said over a million emails between February and July 2017 had been sent to Leave.EU subscribers, including marketing information about GoSkippy, without their consent.It also imposed a £15,000 fine for a separate ""serious"" breach after a Leave.EU newsletter was sent to more than 319,000 email addresses on Eldon's customer database.A final decision is still to be reached on an alleged breach relating to the company's overall handling of personal data.Vote Leave, not Leave.EU, was chosen as the official Leave campaign for the 2016 referendum, and worked with a Canadian analytics firm called AIQ.The ICO focused its investigation on whether, under this arrangement, UK data had been processed in Canada outside UK data protection laws.It said it had found no evidence Vote Leave had ""transferred or processed personal data outside the UK unlawfully - or that it processed personal data without the consent of data subjects"".But it said it was investigating how Vote Leave delivered ""electronic marketing communications"" and whether its actions were a breach of privacy rules.""We do have cause for concern and we will be reporting on this imminently,"" it added.The ICO said it was still looking at how the Remain side handled personal data during the EU referendum campaign.This includes looking at ""the collection and sharing of personal data by Britain Stronger in Europe and a linked data broker"", as well as ""inadequate third party consents"", which were similar to issues investigated on the Leave campaigns, it said.It also investigated a claim that the Liberal Democrats had sold the personal data of its party members to the official Remain campaign - Britain Stronger in Europe - for about £100,000.This was denied by the Lib Dems and the Stronger In campaign.""We are still looking at how the Remain side of the referendum campaign handled personal data, including the electoral roll, and will be considering whether there are any breaches of data protection or electoral law requiring further action,"" the report added.The ICO said the use of personal data to target political messages had to be ""transparent and lawful if we are to preserve the integrity of our election process"".""We may never know whether individuals were unknowingly influenced to vote a certain way in either the UK EU referendum or in the US election campaigns,"" it said.""But we do know that personal privacy rights have been compromised by a number of players and that the digital electoral ecosystem needs reform.""The ICO said it had questioned more than 170 organisations and gathered 700 terabytes of data - the equivalent of 52.2 billion pages of evidence - and it hasn't finished yet.Although its Brexit campaign-related findings will dominate today's reports, its concerns go wider.The watchdog's report said all the UK's 11 major political parties were engaged in risky behaviour and it had sent each a formal warning. Specifically, the ICO is worried about their use of third-party data brokers and analytics firms that pull in and process the public's personal information via a variety of sources without necessarily checking that consent has been properly obtained.In addition, it believes that self-regulation by Facebook and other social media firms has not been consistent or rigorous enough and now believes a code of practice ""enshrined by law"" is required to govern the way their data and platforms are used. The regulator also highlighted deep concerns about university researchers' handling of personal data. It said that while measures were in place to try to make sure academics behaved ethically, the same could not be said for whether they had taken enough steps to protect the public's information - particularly in cases where the same academics also did work for private companies.As a result, the ICO said it was now working with the higher education sector to make sure privacy rules are followed."

Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-07,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

2018-11-07,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-07,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-07,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108003629/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

The Brexiteer said the UK had voted to leave the EU and ""that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else"".The UK and EU want to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit but cannot agree on how to do so.The EU has said it cannot agree to any arrangements which could be left unilaterally by the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to reach a withdrawal agreement with the EU this month. But her cabinet has been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopOne option could be for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement.Mr Fox told reporters: ""We have an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union. That decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine.""Earlier this week Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, tweeted that ""a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to"" by Ireland or the EU.In Paris earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said negotiations with the EU were ""in the final stage"" and he was confident an agreement could be reached. But asked if a deal could be reached in the next week, he said: ""I think seven days is probably pushing it but I am optimistic. I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal but I wouldn't want to be drawn on a specific timetable.""Mr Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference in Dublin: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed.""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the backstop remains a sticking point.It is effectively an insurance policy that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states. Earlier, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plan in July, told the BBC that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan."
2018-11-08,Prince Charles won't speak out when he's king,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46133114,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"".He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch.Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"".He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"".In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"".Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"".The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate.""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said.""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir.""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different.""Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid.""BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy.He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn.""By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondentHe has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others.It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to his heartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten letters raising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention.It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop?Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother.However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king.""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters.""It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power.ArchitectureIn 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"".Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.""Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.""BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.""Wildlife conservationPrince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns.In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.""HomeopathyPrince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself.In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy.Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics."""
2018-11-08,Raab under fire over Dover-Calais comment,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46142188,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDominic Raab has come under fire for saying he ""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods is on the Dover-Calais crossing.The Brexit Secretary's remarks came at a technology conference as he discussed the ""bespoke arrangement"" the UK sought with the EU after it leaves the bloc.Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman suggested Mr Raab ""doesn't even understand the very basics of Brexit"".Conservative pro-Remain MP Nicky Morgan tweeted: ""Gulp.""According to the Institute for Government, Dover is ""a key artery for UK trade heading to continental Europe"" with more than 2.5m heavy goods vehicles passing through the port every year.Its report says goods worth £119bn passed through the port in 2015, ""representing around 17% of the UK's entire trade in goods by value"".Mr Raab told a technology conference on Wednesday: ""We want a bespoke arrangement in goods which recognises the peculiar, frankly, geographic, economic entity that is the United Kingdom.""We are, and I hadn't quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.""And that's one of the reasons why, and there's been a lot of controversy about this, but one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we have a very specific and very proximate relationship with the EU to ensure frictionless trade at the border, particularly for just-in-time manufacturing goods whether it's pharmaceutical goods or perishable goods like food.""""I don't think it's a question so much of the risk of major shortages but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes."" Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"".She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade."""
2018-11-08,Commons hosts women MPs from 86 countries,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46136404,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFemale politicians from 86 countries gathered in the Commons to mark 100 years since women in the UK won the right to vote.UK Women's Minister Penny Mordaunt welcomed 120 women to Parliament, to celebrate achievements and discuss how to further empower women in politics. She hailed the ""heroines of our nation"" who secured the right for women to stand for election and to vote.The event aims to inspire the next generation of female political leaders.It marks the 100th anniversary of the first women in the UK receiving the right to stand for election to Parliament, which came in the same year as some women being allowed to vote.At the start of the day's events, Ms Mordaunt said the women who fought for the right to vote were ""heroines of our nation"". ""One hundred years ago, women in the UK were unable to run for office, or vote, or even be present in the public gallery,"" she said.Pointing upwards, she said: ""And if you look up at the top of the chamber, you will see the ventilation shaft where women would peer through, having gathered in the attic space, where they viewed the proceedings below that affected their lives.""Often they would hear men voicing widely-held concerns that if women were given the vote it would be the end of everything, the downfall of the family, society, the nation. ""But those women knew even then that the opposite was true, that without their rights being secured, and their lives being fulfilled, family, society and nation could never really thrive.""She added that today's female politicians faced private challenges - from juggling multiple caring responsibilities to battling to be taken seriously, sexual harassment, intimidation and abuse.Veteran MP Harriet Harman - former Labour deputy leader - spoke of the achievements of the women in attendance.""We are all pioneers, we have all made a lot of progress but actually we are still women trying to make progress, in what is largely a man's world."" Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott spoke of her own personal experience: ""I was the first black woman ever elected to the British Parliament. I wouldn't want you to think I was elected because my party leader thought we should have a black woman in Parliament. Actually there was struggle and anything worth achieving will always require struggle."" The Women MPs of the World Conference aims to encourage women's participation in parliaments globally, and demonstrate how elected women around the world are shaping the political agenda. Ya Kumba Jaieth, an MP from the National Assembly of Gambia, called for female MPs across the world to create a support network for each other.""We have been electing these men for so long, I think they have failed us. Only we understand our power and only we can empower ourselves"" The discussion followed a Downing Street reception last night, at which Prime Minister Theresa May said more women getting involved in politics would mean a ""greater focus on preventing gender-based violence, on girls' education, on childcare and on women's health"" and ultimately ""a better government"".""A parliament where women are a rare sight is a parliament working with one hand tied behind its back,"" the prime minister said.She added ""if half the population is systematically excluded from politics, then you're also excluding half the talent"".  Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom chaired the session and paid tribute to Dame Tessa Jowell during her speech to highlight her work in British politics. The event follows a report by the Fawcett Society  last week, which suggested that white middle-class men were still seen as the ""ideal"" political candidate, and many women MPs reported being discouraged from putting themselves forward for selection because they had children.

2018-11-08,UK and France 'still friends' after Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46128372,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK and France will remain ""tied by bonds of friendship"" for decades after Brexit, Jeremy Hunt has said.The foreign secretary lauded the cross-channel relationship as ""one of competition, co-operation, similarity and difference"" in a speech in Paris.Officials said the visit was aimed at showing the friendship between the two nations was ""bigger than Brexit"".But there are warnings intelligence-sharing may be damaged if a framework is not set up to mitigate the risks.A report by an Anglo-French task force whose members include former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson and ex-French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has said co-operation in cyber security and counter-terrorism could be imperilled if the UK leaves in March without an overarching agreement. The Brexit process is at a critical phase amid reports Theresa May may seek the approval of her cabinet within days to sign up to an agreement on the terms of the UK's' withdrawal.Mr Hunt is one of a group of leading ministers reported to be insisting on seeing legal advice in full on the conditions of any agreement on the Irish border and how a so-called backstop arrangement - of the UK staying in a customs union to avoid the need for a visible Northern Ireland border - would work.After his speech Mr Hunt was asked about the legal advice. He said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"".""That's very important because the Withdrawal Agreement is a legal document so we need to understand all the legal implications - and of course ultimately whatever the Cabinet decide to endorse will come before parliament and all these issues will be debated in full."" He was also asked if the UK and the EU were likely to agree a deal in the next three weeks, replying:  ""We are in the final phase and I think it is possible to be optimistic about the fact that we are essentially down to a couple of big issues... we are focusing all our efforts on those two issues but  I think it's entirely possible to reach an agreement and everyone wants to do that.""Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was the biggest decision the cabinet and Parliament will have to make, so they should be given the full legal advice.Mr Davis said that he believed that if it was left to the EU to decide when the temporary backstop ended it would ""never happen"".He predicted that the emerging Brexit deal would not be backed by MPs - although he told Today a defeat in the Commons would be likely to lead to the two sides hammering out what he called a better deal.However he insisted that if there was no deal, the UK was a ""big country"" able to ""look after ourselves"" and had hundreds of plans prepared, although there would be some ""hiccups over the first year"".France has taken an uncompromising line on Brexit, with its President Emmanuel Macron lashing out at the UK at a summit in Austria in September, saying its exit could not be allowed to undermine European unity.But French industries also sense an opportunity to lure jobs from London, particularly in the financial services, after the UK leaves.Uncertainty has surrounded bilateral Anglo-French immigration agreements after Brexit although the UK has made it clear it wants these to continue, along with the two countries' advanced defence co-operation.In his speech, delivered in French, Mr Hunt hailed what he said had been nearly 200 years of cross-channel co-operation.He paid tribute to Anglo-French solidarity, which he said was encapsulated by France's emphatic response to the poisonings of the Skripals in Salisbury earlier this year and last year's terror attacks in London.""We will never forget the moment after the Manchester attack when President Macron walked from the Elysee Palace to the British Embassy to express France's solidarity,"" he said.""And the crowd at the Stade de France sang the British national anthem - nor, when, after the Bataclan attack, the crowd at Wembley sang the Marseillaise.""Ahead of the centenary of the end of World War One on Sunday, Mr Hunt said the two countries' destinies were ""yoked together"" by the conflict ""in which we fought and bled side by side for over four years"".The foreign secretary is also holding talks with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on defence, national security and cyber-security.The meeting comes amid calls for the two largest military powers in Europe to step up their co-operation by consolidating a series of bilateral agreements in place since 2010. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Whitehall officials were insisting intelligence sharing exists outside the framework of the EU and they expect it to survive the upheaval of Brexit."
2018-11-08,Davis: May will probably lose Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46137594,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May will probably lose a Commons vote on her Brexit deal, former Brexit Secretary David Davis has said.But Mr Davis - who quit his cabinet role over the Brexit plan in July - said he believed defeat  would prompt the UK and EU to agree a ""better deal"".He also said the UK had hundreds of plans ready in case the country leaves the EU without any agreed Brexit deal.Mr Davis said there might be ""some hiccups"" but the UK was ""a big country"" and ""we can look after ourselves"".Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the UK and the EU have yet to agree on how to guarantee that there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in future.Both sides agreed to put in place a ""backstop"", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.One option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border.But how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled. The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the 27 remaining EU member states. Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan.He said MPs needed to see the ""complete legal advice, not a summary"" before voting on such a crucial issue.Mr Davis added: ""Are we going to have to wait until the Irish government says it's OK to leave? If so, that's not acceptable.""Are we going to have to wait until it's convenient for the (European) Commission to say when we leave? If so, it's not acceptable. ""I suspect that they have not pinned down any of these issues and they need to be pinned down before Parliament votes."" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said that the UK government must have the right to decide when to leave any backstop which involves a customs arrangement.It is understood that the Cabinet has discussed using a mutual (UK and EU) review mechanism to leave any backstop.When asked if a system requiring a mutually agreed withdrawal from a backstop arrangement would be of concern, Mr Fox said that the government ""had an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union and that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine"".UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt delivered a speech in Paris, in French, in which he said the UK and France would remain tied by ""bonds of friendship"" after Brexit.On the issue of publishing the full legal advice, he said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"".Mr Hunt also said that it was ""entirely possible to reach an agreement"" within the next three weeks, although to reach agreement within the next week might be ""pushing it a bit"".In Dublin, the Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British Cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed.""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British Government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.""So while of course we want progress to be made and we want it to be made as quickly as possible because time is moving on, I would urge caution that people don't get carried away on the back of rumour in the coming days."""

A petition on the government website has gained over 123,000 signatures - those with more than 100,000 are considered for debate.It cites environmental concerns about single-use plastic. Currently supermarkets are not required by law to offer shoppers plastic free or eco-friendly packaging. But Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042. And individual supermarkets have set themselves their own targets to reduce packaging.The debate will start at 1630 GMT on the 12 November.The five constituencies with the most people who signed and supported the petition were: Bristol West, Brighton Pavilion, Edinburgh East, Edinburgh North and Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport.  A government spokesman said;  ""We are working with retailers and the Waste and Resources Action Programme to explore the potential for the introduction of plastic-free initiatives in supermarkets in which fresh food is sold loose."""

In a statement, it said the delay was necessary because some people were trying to ""game"" its ID system.Weaknesses were exposed by news companies who posed as US politicians, terror groups and other banned organisations. When the initiative was first announced it was due to become compulsory for political advertisers by 7 November.Facebook said it now hoped to finish work to strengthen the ID system in the next month.The announcement comes soon after the company's founder Mark Zuckerberg again rebuffed a call by the UK Parliament to appear before it. MPs want to quiz Mr Zuckerberg about fake news, political ads and disinformation.In a statement given to the Guardian, Facebook said it had ""learnt"" that some people were entering ""inaccurate details"" into its ID system and was now ""working to improve our review process to detect and prevent this kind of abuse"".It added: ""Once we have strengthened our process for ensuring the accuracy of disclaimers, we will be introducing enforcement systems to identify political advertisers and require them to go through the authorisation process.""The identity system, which was intended to improve transparency about who pays for adverts that run on the social network, was introduced on a voluntary basis in October. This let advertisers register information that verified their location and report who had paid for particular ads. Information was due to be added to a library of data that would be held for seven years. The initiative prompted some news organisations to test the ID system. News channel Vice found it was straightforward to make the system believe ads were being submitted by US Vice-President Mike Pence or the Islamic State terrorist group. Other organisations had similar success fooling the ID system.Facebook said ""hundreds"" of people had gone through its authorisation process since the ID system was set up. Anyone signing up was ""required"" to ""represent themselves accurately"", it said. "

Unions have criticised the government for failing to intervene and ensure the project went ahead.The Japanese firm said it would start the wind-up process in January.""After considering the additional costs entailed in continuing to operate NuGen, Toshiba recognises that the economically rational decision is to withdraw from the UK nuclear power plant construction project, and has resolved to take steps to wind-up NuGen,"" the Toshiba statement said. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) had been a preferred bidder to take over the nuclear power plant project, but those talks fell through after more than a year of negotiations.Toshiba said it expected to take a 15bn yen ($131.8m; £100.5m) hit from the withdrawal, but shares in the firm jumped 12.7% in Tokyo. The GMB union said the ""looming collapse"" of Moorside had been ""depressingly predictable"".""Relying in this way on foreign companies for our country's essential energy needs was always irresponsible,"" said its national officer Justin Bowden. ""A new nuclear power station in West Cumbria remains vital for the UK's future energy security and requires urgent action.""In September NuGen announced it was reducing its team at Moorside from more than 100 to fewer than 40 - leading to speculation the plant's development was in jeopardy.NuGen was initially co-owned by Toshiba and the French firm Engie. Toshiba was subsequently forced to buy the remaining 40% of NuGen it did not already own via a bankruptcy condition related to Engie. "

But Mr Gove insisted monitoring of SSSIs had been taken on by other staff.The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has one of the largest Brexit-related workloads, given the major changes on the horizon for the UK's farming and fishing industries outside the EU.In a letter to the Environmental Audit Committee, Mr Gove said his department was hiring 2,000 extra staff to deal with Brexit-related matters and that 1,800 of these were already in post.But he also revealed that 400 staff had been transferred from other public agencies under the department's aegis, including:From Natural England alone, 50 staff have been drafted in, on two-year secondments.Mary Creagh, the Labour MP who chairs the cross-party committee, said this was worrying given the vital statutory work undertaken by the agency in protecting the UK's natural environment.""Natural England must not become a poor relation to Defra,"" she said. ""Ministers must ensure the valuable work it does to protect biodiversity is given the priority it deserves.""Preparations for leaving the EU must not get in the way of protecting our treasured natural spaces and iconic British wildlife.""Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the ""raid"" on Natural England compounded already deep cutbacks at the agency, whose funding for protecting the UK's 4,126 SSSIs had been cut by 55% since 2010. She is calling on Mr Gove to reinforce the agency's specialist natural environmental officers at once. ""This letter proves Michael Gove's promise of a green Brexit is pure bluster,"" she said.""The government's poaching of Natural England staff for Brexit work is the latest in a string of cutbacks that are decimating the agency that looks after irreplaceable habitats and beautiful landscapes.""Of the 50 staff who have transferred, 13 were previously devoting 50% of their time to working on SSSIs. Mr Gove said these responsibilities had been passed ""to others to absorb"", emphasising that his department would continue to fulfil its statutory duties by hiring staff on a temporary basis or promoting within. ""When identifying candidates for secondment, consideration was given to ensuring the potential impact on Natural England's key performance indicators was minimised,"" he said. But he added: ""Secondees' substantive roles which are not deemed a high priority have been left unfilled and work reallocated or paused for now.""SSSIs are designated on the grounds of their special conservation value, in terms of their wildlife or their geological or topographical characteristics.Natural England is expected to inspect most sites at least once every six years to check they remain in a ""favourable condition"" but MPs have warned 47% have not been examined since 2012 in breach of guidelines."

Leaving the Cabinet Office after studying the incomplete draft agreement, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told Sky News it was a ""great document"". The UK and the EU cannot agree on the precise arrangements to avoid new border checks in Northern Ireland.BBC Brussels correspondent Adam FlemingBrussels is more concerned about the form in which the backstop exists, not how it's exited from. The EU is exploring the concept of a UK-wide customs arrangement to deal with the Irish border issue. But some member states want extra guarantees on rules and regulations if they are to offer the UK quota-free and tariff-free access to the single market. Some question if it's legally possible to agree during the Brexit talks instead of in the detailed negotiations over the future relationship that will begin after exit day. Others fret that they're being kept in the dark by the EU negotiators. But Brussels is united on two issues: the ultimate insurance policy remains a Northern Ireland-only element to the backstop, and the UK can't decide to withdraw from it on its own. Both sides agreed to put in place a ""backstop"", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a frictionless border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.One option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border.But how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled.The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work.Meanwhile, former prime minister David Cameron has said he ""fully supports"" his successor's handling of the process.Speaking ahead of a visit to the Treasury, where he was to look at documents for his memoirs, Mr Cameron said the prime minister should be ""left to get on"" with negotiating a deal.

2018-11-08,The next Juncker,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46113924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEurope's centre-right parties are gathering in Helsinki to select their candidate in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission in 2019.  Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-08,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November. Afterwards, you can find it on BBC Sounds."
2018-11-08,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-08,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181108213404/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, said they cannot support any deal which included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK.Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Kent, said the choice being finalised was either:He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister.But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public.""The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued.Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergFor some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit.A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead.He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact.Read Laura's full blogHe added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union.""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act.""In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb.For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"".But asked in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel whether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit.""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans.""Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal.And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum.David Davis, who quit as Brexit Secretary over Mrs May's Chequers Brexit plan, tweeted: Sorry to see @JoJohnsonUK resign. He's right that the Government's current proposals are ""a travesty of Brexit"" and represent a huge democratic deficit - out of Europe but run by Europe. However, a 2nd referendum is not the way forward and is not supported by the public.End of Twitter post  by @DavidDavisMP"
2018-11-09,DUP leader urges PM to 'reflect' on EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46147628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock.The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster, leaked to the Times.Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides.Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"".The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that.Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"".""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader.""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.       Mrs Foster added: ""I believe that not only would we not be able to support what she has sent to us but that there are many others that wouldn't be able to support it in her own party as well.""If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.""The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"".The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date.The BBC's John Campbell said what was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs.He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"".The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead.""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."""

During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers.  Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war.Long read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video: War footage brought alive in colour Interactive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?Living history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison.  Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday.  The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery.  Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys.A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards.Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces.The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial.A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion.On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty.""Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"".She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".""We remember the heroes who lost their lives in the horror of the trenches. As the sun sets on 100 years of remembrance, we will never forget their sacrifice."" "
2018-11-09,UK economy grows at fastest rate since 2016,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46151172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said.The figure for the third quarter is in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September.It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%.Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months.The ONS also issued a separate monthly figure for September, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth.Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.Simon Jack, business editorThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.  Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.""ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.""Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters."""

""We all have different ways, mine is Lego.""The Conservative MP also said claims that he did not read any newspapers were ""complete nonsense"".Mr Wright, whose department is conducting a review of the future economic viability of the press, raised eyebrows last month when he told a media conference he did not subscribe to any newspapers or magazines.He told Talk Radio that he had given a straight answer to a straight question when he was asked if he had read a newspaper on the morning of the Society of Editors event in Salford.""The answer I gave was I didn't read a newspaper that morning which was true,"" he said. ""To suggest that I don't read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do.""What politicians do in their spare time is a subject of enduring interest and occasionally political significance. For some, it is watching their local football team - if they can remember which one they support - or going to the opera. For the prime minister, it is famously walking in the Welsh, or Swiss or Italian hills. The former attorney general, and father-of-two, has a more unusual hinterland for a 46-year old but one which most parents will be able to identify with. ""In my view it is a great way of putting your brain into neutral, which sometimes we all need to do,"" he says of the building bricks. And just how big is his collection? ""It is very large indeed, my wife would say far too large but I find Lego therapeutic."""

Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"".She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade."""

The Brexiteer said the UK had voted to leave the EU and ""that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else"".The UK and EU want to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit but cannot agree on how to do so.The EU has said it cannot agree to any arrangements which could be left unilaterally by the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to reach a withdrawal agreement with the EU this month. But her cabinet has been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopOne option could be for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement.Mr Fox told reporters: ""We have an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union. That decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine.""Earlier this week Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, tweeted that ""a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to"" by Ireland or the EU.In Paris earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said negotiations with the EU were ""in the final stage"" and he was confident an agreement could be reached. But asked if a deal could be reached in the next week, he said: ""I think seven days is probably pushing it but I am optimistic. I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal but I wouldn't want to be drawn on a specific timetable.""Mr Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference in Dublin: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed.""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the backstop remains a sticking point.It is effectively an insurance policy that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states. Earlier, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plan in July, told the BBC that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan."

""With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing, and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it's becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services,"" said Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee.The enquiry will also consider:Tom Selby, a senior analyst with the investment platform AJ Bell, said there was no easy answer to improve the situation.""Although there are some customers who may more obviously be vulnerable, such as those diagnosed with Alzheimer's, anyone can potentially become vulnerable at any time. ""Furthermore, it is not always obvious when someone is vulnerable. Many people suffer for long periods with debilitating depression, for example, without even their closest family knowing,"" he said."
2018-11-09,Prince Charles won't speak out when he's king,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46133114,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"".He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch.Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"".He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"".In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"".Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"".The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate.""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said.""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir.""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different.""Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid.""BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy.He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn.""By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondentHe has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others.It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to his heartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten letters raising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention.It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop?Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother.However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king.""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters.""It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power.ArchitectureIn 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"".Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.""Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.""BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.""Wildlife conservationPrince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns.In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.""HomeopathyPrince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself.In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy.Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics."""

She hailed the ""heroines of our nation"" who secured the right for women to stand for election and to vote.The event aims to inspire the next generation of female political leaders.It marks the 100th anniversary of the first women in the UK receiving the right to stand for election to Parliament, which came in the same year as some women being allowed to vote.At the start of the day's events, Ms Mordaunt said the women who fought for the right to vote were ""heroines of our nation"". ""One hundred years ago, women in the UK were unable to run for office, or vote, or even be present in the public gallery,"" she said.Pointing upwards, she said: ""And if you look up at the top of the chamber, you will see the ventilation shaft where women would peer through, having gathered in the attic space, where they viewed the proceedings below that affected their lives.""Often they would hear men voicing widely-held concerns that if women were given the vote it would be the end of everything, the downfall of the family, society, the nation. ""But those women knew even then that the opposite was true, that without their rights being secured, and their lives being fulfilled, family, society and nation could never really thrive.""She added that today's female politicians faced private challenges - from juggling multiple caring responsibilities to battling to be taken seriously, sexual harassment, intimidation and abuse.Veteran MP Harriet Harman - former Labour deputy leader - spoke of the achievements of the women in attendance.""We are all pioneers, we have all made a lot of progress but actually we are still women trying to make progress, in what is largely a man's world."" Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott spoke of her own personal experience: ""I was the first black woman ever elected to the British Parliament. I wouldn't want you to think I was elected because my party leader thought we should have a black woman in Parliament. Actually there was struggle and anything worth achieving will always require struggle."" The Women MPs of the World Conference aims to encourage women's participation in parliaments globally, and demonstrate how elected women around the world are shaping the political agenda. Ya Kumba Jaieth, an MP from the National Assembly of Gambia, called for female MPs across the world to create a support network for each other.""We have been electing these men for so long, I think they have failed us. Only we understand our power and only we can empower ourselves"" BREAKING: You probably won't see this on the news.

Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom chaired the session and paid tribute to Dame Tessa Jowell during her speech to highlight her work in British politics. The event follows a report by the Fawcett Society  last week, which suggested that white middle-class men were still seen as the ""ideal"" political candidate, and many women MPs reported being discouraged from putting themselves forward for selection because they had children.

The Brexit process is at a critical phase amid reports Theresa May may seek the approval of her cabinet within days to sign up to an agreement on the terms of the UK's' withdrawal.Mr Hunt is one of a group of leading ministers reported to be insisting on seeing legal advice in full on the conditions of any agreement on the Irish border and how a so-called backstop arrangement - of the UK staying in a customs union to avoid the need for a visible Northern Ireland border - would work.After his speech Mr Hunt was asked about the legal advice. He said: ""We have an excellent attorney general and he is giving very good legal advice on everything that we are considering signing up to, so we are going into this with our eyes open"".""That's very important because the Withdrawal Agreement is a legal document so we need to understand all the legal implications - and of course ultimately whatever the Cabinet decide to endorse will come before parliament and all these issues will be debated in full."" He was also asked if the UK and the EU were likely to agree a deal in the next three weeks, replying:  ""We are in the final phase and I think it is possible to be optimistic about the fact that we are essentially down to a couple of big issues... we are focusing all our efforts on those two issues but  I think it's entirely possible to reach an agreement and everyone wants to do that.""Former Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was the biggest decision the cabinet and Parliament will have to make, so they should be given the full legal advice.Mr Davis said that he believed that if it was left to the EU to decide when the temporary backstop ended it would ""never happen"".He predicted that the emerging Brexit deal would not be backed by MPs - although he told Today a defeat in the Commons would be likely to lead to the two sides hammering out what he called a better deal.However he insisted that if there was no deal, the UK was a ""big country"" able to ""look after ourselves"" and had hundreds of plans prepared, although there would be some ""hiccups over the first year"".France has taken an uncompromising line on Brexit, with its President Emmanuel Macron lashing out at the UK at a summit in Austria in September, saying its exit could not be allowed to undermine European unity.But French industries also sense an opportunity to lure jobs from London, particularly in the financial services, after the UK leaves.Uncertainty has surrounded bilateral Anglo-French immigration agreements after Brexit although the UK has made it clear it wants these to continue, along with the two countries' advanced defence co-operation.In his speech, delivered in French, Mr Hunt hailed what he said had been nearly 200 years of cross-channel co-operation.He paid tribute to Anglo-French solidarity, which he said was encapsulated by France's emphatic response to the poisonings of the Skripals in Salisbury earlier this year and last year's terror attacks in London.""We will never forget the moment after the Manchester attack when President Macron walked from the Elysee Palace to the British Embassy to express France's solidarity,"" he said.""And the crowd at the Stade de France sang the British national anthem - nor, when, after the Bataclan attack, the crowd at Wembley sang the Marseillaise.""Ahead of the centenary of the end of World War One on Sunday, Mr Hunt said the two countries' destinies were ""yoked together"" by the conflict ""in which we fought and bled side by side for over four years"".The foreign secretary is also holding talks with his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian on defence, national security and cyber-security.The meeting comes amid calls for the two largest military powers in Europe to step up their co-operation by consolidating a series of bilateral agreements in place since 2010. The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner said Whitehall officials were insisting intelligence sharing exists outside the framework of the EU and they expect it to survive the upheaval of Brexit."

The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the 27 remaining EU member states. Mr Davis told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan.He said MPs needed to see the ""complete legal advice, not a summary"" before voting on such a crucial issue.Mr Davis added: ""Are we going to have to wait until the Irish government says it's OK to leave?

2018-11-09,The next Juncker,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46113924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEurope's centre-right parties are gathering in Helsinki to select their candidate in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission in 2019.  Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"
2018-11-09,Bullying claims,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46044638,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are set to debate a major report into bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons. But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-09,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November. Afterwards, you can find it on BBC Sounds."
2018-11-09,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."
2018-11-09,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46034136,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe claim: People on the lowest incomes benefit most from Monday's Budget.Reality Check verdict: The Treasury has not published analysis of whether this Budget will help the richest or poorest the most. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-09,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181109193711/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

Mrs May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.Downing Street has insisted there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"". Asked whether he agreed with Mr Johnson's call, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Not really, no. The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights.""He said Labour would hold the government to account over any Brexit deal put to the Commons and could still vote against it.By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondentJo Johnson's resignation feels like a very significant moment. Here is a former Remain-supporting Conservative minister saying what others mutter privately about Brexit. His lacerating criticism of the government's negotiation and call for another referendum has opened another flank in the Tory party for Theresa May to worry about. Tory whips know many (40, 50, more?) Brexiteers are threatening to vote against any deal she gets from the EU in the Commons because they think it ties the UK too closely to the EU. But the whips must also worry about Remainer Tories determined to derail the whole thing because of the costs they fear Brexit will inflict on the country. With no majority in the Commons, No10's task could have just got harder.Mr Johnson's resignation also fires up those in all parties who say another referendum is now needed - a suggestion again slapped down by Downing Street. But right now, in the middle of this remembrance weekend, Mrs May will be relieved his resignation has not prompted others to follow him out of government. There has been no domino effect, yet.But while Westminster waits for the PM to put her final Brexit blueprint before the Cabinet for approval, these are febrile days.In a resignation statement on Friday, Mr Johnson, who is the brother of former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, argued Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, saying what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"".Mr Johnson told Today: ""My view is that this is so different from what was billed that it would be an absolute travesty if we do not go back to the people and ask them if they actually do want to exit the EU on this extraordinarily hopeless basis.""Asked if his brother had lied to voters during the referendum, he said: ""In the campaign there were undoubtedly promises made that have shown to be undeliverable. No-one can dispute that.""It was a false prospectus. It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were. We are now faced with the reality of that in the form of a deal the prime minister is about to bring back before parliament."" Please upgrade your browserHe added he had become ""deeply concerned"" about the potential impact of a no-deal outcome while a minister.Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former First Secretary of State Damian Green, both rejected another referendum.Mr Green told Today it ""would be divisive but it wouldn't be decisive"", and all the evidence showed the country was ""still, more or less, split down the middle"".Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson was ""re-heating 'Project Fear' to stop us leaving"".Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb."
2018-11-10,WW1 hero finally added to MPs' memorial,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46149900,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA forgotten hero has finally been remembered on Parliament's World War One memorial.The marble installation recognises the sacrifice of peers, MPs, MPs' sons, and senior officers of Parliament, who died in service during the Great War.But 96 years after its completion, a leading historian realised one MP had been left off.Now Lieutenant Gerald Arbuthnot, once the Conservative MP for Burnley, has had his name belatedly added.The 44-year-old was killed in action in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.Dr Kathryn Rix, from the History of Parliament Trust, spotted his name's absence from the memorial and said it's not clear why he was forgotten.""I think perhaps it was because he wasn't an MP for very long,"" she said. ""Perhaps people didn't remember he was an MP between January and December 1910.""Also he was a former MP at the time and they weren't originally added to the memorial in 1921.""But then some former MPs were added in 1922, so really, he should have been added at that time.""They just forgot him - which is rather sad - but now he is being remembered.""The historian had been researching the stories of parliamentarians killed in action during the war when she realised a name was missing from the memorial, known as the Recording Angel, which was designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921.She had a list of 24 members and former members of Parliament who had died but noticed only 23 on the memorial in St Stephen's Porch, Westminster Hall. She said all of Parliament's official documents and guidebooks will now need to be amended, adding: ""It's really nice to have added him now. I feel very proud.""After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1906, Gerald Arbuthnot was elected as the Conservative MP for Burnley in January 1910. However he lost the seat in December of the same year during a second election.He chose not to stand again, but remained in politics in other ways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Navy.But Dr Rix explained: ""He's unusual amongst the MPs who died in that he served in the Navy, He'd served in the Navy as a young man, and at the start of the war he joined the Royal Naval Reserve.""He was initially with their press bureau, but that wasn't involved enough in the fighting for him. So he joined a minesweeping division and commanded minesweepers in the North Sea for 15 months.""But he was very keen to go and have active engagement with the enemy. So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916.""By May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards.On 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs.Lt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment.Dr Rix explained: ""This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed.""The soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt.Despite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial.With the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added.His distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years.But in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name.Long read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video: War footage brought alive in colour Interactive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?Living history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended Lord Arbuthnot said: ""I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist. ""It's an extraordinary story. He was part of a generation who truly believed in duty and serving their country. ""It feels very good - an extra bit of knowledge about what members of Parliament, what my family, did in that war has come to light and we can remember him properly now.""We're very proud. Though I always remember my grandfather who died at Ypres in 1915, to know there was also Gerald Arbuthnot is really very nice.""There were a number of my family members killed in the First World War. It's just good to be able to join him to the family memory."" In total, 264 MPs or former MPs served in World War One, with 23 of these making the ultimate sacrifice. In addition, 323 members of the Lords served, with 24 being killed (one of whom was also an MP - meaning some list 24 MPs as having died). Mark Collins, the Parliamentary estate's archivist and historian, said: ""With the work of the History of Parliament Trust, we're sure that we have all of the names of those peers and those MPs and the sons of MPs [who died]. All their names have now been included."""
2018-11-10,DUP leader urges PM to 'reflect' on EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46147628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock.The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster, leaked to the Times.Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides.Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"".The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that.Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"".""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader.""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.       Mrs Foster added: ""I believe that not only would we not be able to support what she has sent to us but that there are many others that wouldn't be able to support it in her own party as well.""If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.""The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"".The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date.The BBC's John Campbell said what was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs.He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"".The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead.""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."""
2018-11-10,Minister Jo Johnson quits over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46155403,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJo Johnson has quit as transport minister and called for the public to have a fresh say on Brexit.The MP, who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum, said the  deal being negotiated with the EU ""will be a terrible mistake"".Arguing Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, he said what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"".Downing Street thanked him for his work but ruled out another referendum.Jo Johnson voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum while his brother Boris, who quit as foreign secretary in July, was a leading Brexiteer.His brother praised his decision, saying they were ""united in dismay"" at the PM's handling of the negotiations. Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, said they cannot support any deal which included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK.Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Kent, said the choice being finalised was either:He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister.But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public.""The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued.Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergFor some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit.A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead.He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact.Read Laura's full blogHe added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union.""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act.""In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb.For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"".But asked in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel whether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit.""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans.""Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal.And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum.Huge respect for @JoJohnsonUK . It’s tough resigning from a Ministerial post, he’s done the right thing. Now is the time for people to stand up for what they believe in or we will sleepwalk to a #Brexit disaster. There is another way – it’s a @peoplesvote_ukEnd of Twitter post  by @Anna_SoubryDavid Davis, who quit as Brexit Secretary over Mrs May's Chequers Brexit plan, tweeted: Sorry to see @JoJohnsonUK resign. He's right that the Government's current proposals are ""a travesty of Brexit"" and represent a huge democratic deficit - out of Europe but run by Europe. However, a 2nd referendum is not the way forward and is not supported by the public.End of Twitter post  by @DavidDavisMP"

During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers.  Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war.Long read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video: War footage brought alive in colour Interactive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?Living history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison.  Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday.  The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery.  Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys.A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards.Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces.The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial.A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion.On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty.""Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"".She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".""We remember the heroes who lost their lives in the horror of the trenches. As the sun sets on 100 years of remembrance, we will never forget their sacrifice."" "
2018-11-10,UK economy grows at fastest rate since 2016,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46151172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said.The figure for the third quarter is in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September.It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%.Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months.The ONS also issued a separate monthly figure for September, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth.Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.Simon Jack, business editorThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.  Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.""ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.""Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters."""
2018-11-10,Which cabinet minister uses Lego to relax?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46149899,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA cabinet minister has spoken about how he likes to unwind by spending time with his ""very large"" Lego collection.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told Talk Radio he found assembling the building bricks ""therapeutic"".""I think everybody who does any difficult or stressful job needs a way to switch off,"" he said. ""We all have different ways, mine is Lego.""The Conservative MP also said claims that he did not read any newspapers were ""complete nonsense"".Mr Wright, whose department is conducting a review of the future economic viability of the press, raised eyebrows last month when he told a media conference he did not subscribe to any newspapers or magazines.He told Talk Radio that he had given a straight answer to a straight question when he was asked if he had read a newspaper on the morning of the Society of Editors event in Salford.""The answer I gave was I didn't read a newspaper that morning which was true,"" he said. ""To suggest that I don't read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do.""What politicians do in their spare time is a subject of enduring interest and occasionally political significance. For some, it is watching their local football team - if they can remember which one they support - or going to the opera. For the prime minister, it is famously walking in the Welsh, or Swiss or Italian hills. The former attorney general, and father-of-two, has a more unusual hinterland for a 46-year old but one which most parents will be able to identify with. ""In my view it is a great way of putting your brain into neutral, which sometimes we all need to do,"" he says of the building bricks. And just how big is his collection? ""It is very large indeed, my wife would say far too large but I find Lego therapeutic."""

Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"".She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade."""
2018-11-10,"UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox",https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46145284,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK must have the power to end any post-Brexit ""backstop"" customs accord with the EU on its own, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said.  The Brexiteer said the UK had voted to leave the EU and ""that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else"".The UK and EU want to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit but cannot agree on how to do so.The EU has said it cannot agree to any arrangements which could be left unilaterally by the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to reach a withdrawal agreement with the EU this month. But her cabinet has been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopOne option could be for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement.Mr Fox told reporters: ""We have an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union. That decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine.""Earlier this week Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, tweeted that ""a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to"" by Ireland or the EU.In Paris earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said negotiations with the EU were ""in the final stage"" and he was confident an agreement could be reached. But asked if a deal could be reached in the next week, he said: ""I think seven days is probably pushing it but I am optimistic. I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal but I wouldn't want to be drawn on a specific timetable.""Mr Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference in Dublin: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed.""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the backstop remains a sticking point.It is effectively an insurance policy that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states. Earlier, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plan in July, told the BBC that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan."

""With customers expected to take more responsibility for their financial planning and resilience, bank branches closing, and the number of free-to-use ATMs falling, it's becoming increasingly difficult for vulnerable customers to access certain financial services,"" said Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee.The enquiry will also consider:Tom Selby, a senior analyst with the investment platform AJ Bell, said there was no easy answer to improve the situation.""Although there are some customers who may more obviously be vulnerable, such as those diagnosed with Alzheimer's, anyone can potentially become vulnerable at any time. ""Furthermore, it is not always obvious when someone is vulnerable. Many people suffer for long periods with debilitating depression, for example, without even their closest family knowing,"" he said."
2018-11-10,Prince Charles won't speak out when he's king,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46133114,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Prince of Wales says he will stop speaking out on topics he feels strongly about when he becomes king, as he is ""not that stupid"".He has campaigned on issues such as the environment for decades but says he would not do the same as monarch.Speaking in a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Prince Charles said the idea that he would continue making interventions was ""nonsense"".He said he would have to operate within ""constitutional parameters"".In the documentary, Prince Charles was asked about his campaigning, which some people have described as ""meddling"".Documentary film-maker John Bridcut, who followed the royal for 12 months, said Prince Charles ""bridled a bit"" at the use of the word ""meddling"" and instead preferred to think of his interventions as ""motivating"".The heir to the throne said: ""If it's meddling to worry about the inner cities as I did 40 years ago, then if that's meddling I'm proud of it."" He said the roles of Prince of Wales and king were completely separate.""It's vital to remember there's only room for one sovereign at a time, not two,"" he said.""So, you can't be the same as the sovereign if you're the Prince of Wales or the heir.""But the idea, somehow, that I'm going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two - the two situations - are completely different.""Asked whether his public campaigning would continue, he said: ""No, it won't. I'm not that stupid.""BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said, however, that, in private, Prince Charles could still seek to influence government policy.He said: ""The definition of what he is entitled to do as sovereign is to encourage and to warn.""By Nicholas Witchell, BBC royal correspondentHe has spent his adult life trying, as he puts it, ""to make a difference"". Often that has led the Prince of Wales to speak out about topics about which he feels deeply: the environment, GM crops, inner cities, architecture, education, homeopathic medicine and others.It has, on occasions, caused irritation within the government departments that have had to respond to his heartfelt ""black spider"" handwritten letters raising, always courteously but often insistently, some issue that has come to the prince's attention.It has all given rise to a greater concern. Does Prince Charles fully appreciate that, when he succeeds his mother and becomes Britain's king, these interventions will have to stop?Those who know him have said for years that privately he fully understands that, as king, he would have to stop his ""campaigning"". Prince Charles himself has always baulked at saying as much publicly. He's said to feel that any reference to how he will function as monarch could be seen as being disrespectful to his mother.However, with the Queen now in her 93rd year, and with Prince Charles about to celebrate his 70th birthday, he has finally said - publicly and explicitly - that he does recognise his interventions on matters of public debate will have to stop as soon as he becomes king.""You operate,"" he says in the BBC documentary, ""within the constitutional parameters.""It is reasonable to suppose his assurances will be heard with some relief within Whitehall and the corridors of power.ArchitectureIn 1984, Prince Charles gave a speech criticising a modernist design for an extension to the National Gallery in London. He said it looked like a ""vast municipal fire station"" and, if it were to be built - the proposal was subsequently dropped - would be a ""monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend"".Indeed, the Prince of Wales has campaigned for traditional urban design and architecture for many years. And this led to heir to the throne establishing the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture in 1986, now known as The Prince's Foundation. In 1992, he said: ""I didn't particularly want to see this country, which I mind about and love greatly, disappear under a welter of ugliness.""Climate change The heir to the throne has spoken passionately about climate change and environmental sustainability. In 2017, he said humans must live in harmony with their environment. He added: ""Failure to do so, and I fear that we are already perilously close to doing this, will prove catastrophic.""BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin said: ""The prince warned decades ago about human-induced climate change. ""It was controversial to some at the time but now there's scientific consensus on the threat.""Wildlife conservationPrince Charles has been a staunch supporter of wildlife conservation and anti-poaching campaigns.In 2018, he said: ""With the current rate of biodiversity loss now running at 1,000 times the natural rate, we appear to have managed to initiate the planet's sixth great extinction event and still seem utterly hell bent on destroying what little we have left.""HomeopathyPrince Charles has sparked some criticism for his support of homeopathy - a treatment based on the use of highly diluted substances to allegedly aid the body to heal itself.In 2015, he told an international gathering of scientists and government officials he treated his own cows and sheep with homeopathy.Clarence House later said: ""Homeopathy is used on a case-by-case basis at Home Farm, in combination with more conventional medicine, to minimise dependence on antibiotics."""

She hailed the ""heroines of our nation"" who secured the right for women to stand for election and to vote.The event aims to inspire the next generation of female political leaders.It marks the 100th anniversary of the first women in the UK receiving the right to stand for election to Parliament, which came in the same year as some women being allowed to vote.At the start of the day's events, Ms Mordaunt said the women who fought for the right to vote were ""heroines of our nation"". ""One hundred years ago, women in the UK were unable to run for office, or vote, or even be present in the public gallery,"" she said.Pointing upwards, she said: ""And if you look up at the top of the chamber, you will see the ventilation shaft where women would peer through, having gathered in the attic space, where they viewed the proceedings below that affected their lives.""Often they would hear men voicing widely-held concerns that if women were given the vote it would be the end of everything, the downfall of the family, society, the nation. ""But those women knew even then that the opposite was true, that without their rights being secured, and their lives being fulfilled, family, society and nation could never really thrive.""She added that today's female politicians faced private challenges - from juggling multiple caring responsibilities to battling to be taken seriously, sexual harassment, intimidation and abuse.Veteran MP Harriet Harman - former Labour deputy leader - spoke of the achievements of the women in attendance.""We are all pioneers, we have all made a lot of progress but actually we are still women trying to make progress, in what is largely a man's world."" Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott spoke of her own personal experience: ""I was the first black woman ever elected to the British Parliament. I wouldn't want you to think I was elected because my party leader thought we should have a black woman in Parliament. Actually there was struggle and anything worth achieving will always require struggle."" The Women MPs of the World Conference aims to encourage women's participation in parliaments globally, and demonstrate how elected women around the world are shaping the political agenda. Ya Kumba Jaieth, an MP from the National Assembly of Gambia, called for female MPs across the world to create a support network for each other.""We have been electing these men for so long, I think they have failed us. Only we understand our power and only we can empower ourselves"" BREAKING: You probably won't see this on the news.

Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom chaired the session and paid tribute to Dame Tessa Jowell during her speech to highlight her work in British politics. The event follows a report by the Fawcett Society  last week, which suggested that white middle-class men were still seen as the ""ideal"" political candidate, and many women MPs reported being discouraged from putting themselves forward for selection because they had children.

Jean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.Wartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said ""the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man"".During his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was ""a shorthand writer's dream"", and Mr Cole described her as ""as good as the men"", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff. Records suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.Mrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay. She sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was £250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.It is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.The amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.Mr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating ""practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men"".He added ""this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary"".Her call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.Her pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.Ms Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament ""cannot be run on the basis of equal pay"" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.In 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: ""I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.""In January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.Mrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland. From Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.Hansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said ""she was a woman who would not take no for an answer"".""As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,"" she said.

2018-11-10,The next Juncker,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46113924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEurope's centre-right parties are gathering in Helsinki to select their candidate in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission in 2019.  Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"
2018-11-10,Bullying claims,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46044638,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMPs are set to debate a major report into bullying and sexual harassment in the House of Commons. But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-10,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November. Afterwards, you can find it on BBC Sounds."
2018-11-10,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111004331/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

What we have to do is hold our nerve and keep negotiating, make sure that we are pointing out to our EU friends and neighbours that it's in all of our interests to get a good deal.""The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's scheduled exit from the bloc next March.While it says a deal is 95% agreed, they have been unable to agree on a legally binding mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Earlier shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including another referendum, if a Brexit deal was voted down in the Commons. Mrs Leadsom, who Theresa May beat to the Conservative leadership in 2016, said there would not be another referendum if MPs rejected the final withdrawal deal. But she said she believed ""most members of Parliament would vote for a deal rather than no deal"".If sufficient progress is made on the ""backstop"" it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.One option is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement - while the EU says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.By BBC political correspondent Jessica ParkerMPs on all sides are readily setting out their conditions and caveats when it comes to a potential Brexit deal.And while Andrea Leadsom made it clear that she still supports Prime Minister Theresa May, there was a hint too that she has her own red lines, saying that the UK must not end up trapped in an EU customs arrangement. This plays into wider fears in some Conservative quarters that Mrs May could end up accepting a compromise too far on the ""backstop"" issue, in order to get a withdrawal agreement with the EU over the line.  Mrs Leadsom said while the backstop was not a ""likely scenario"" - because she believed a trade deal could be reached before it would be necessary - it must be ""time limited"" and ""include the entire UK"", rather than just Northern Ireland. And the UK must be able to decide to leave it - without the EU overturning that decision.She added: ""The UK cannot be forced to remain in a customs arrangement. Now how that specifically works is exactly what is being discussed and negotiated on now. The UK cannot be held against its will in a customs arrangement.""Earlier Education Secretary Damian Hinds said: ""If you have too hard a line about saying, 'Well we must just have a totally unilateral exit, or there's an absolutely fixed, hard end date,' that is... very, very unlikely that is going to be negotiable with the other side.""On the other hand, people here rightly want comfort and they should be able to have comfort and confidence that it isn't an open-ended thing.""Meanwhile, General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show what the military might be called on to do, in the event the UK leaves the EU with no withdrawal deal in place, saying ""we stand ready to help in any way we can"".Defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News the government had to plan for every scenario adding: ""There are contingency plans being made, there are discussions being held behind the scenes as to what support our armed forces will do.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states.

2018-11-11,Thornberry: New referendum 'still an option',https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46168194,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour frontbencher Emily Thornberry has told the BBC ""all options remain on the table"", including a new referendum, if MPs vote down a Brexit deal.She was asked about party leader Jeremy Corbyn's comment to a German newspaper that Brexit cannot be stopped.Labour would prefer a general election, she said, but could campaign for ""a People's Vote"" if it were not possible. Tory cabinet minister Damian Hinds said MPs must ""consider the alternatives"" if they vote down the deal.The government has not yet agreed a withdrawal deal with the European Union, ahead of the UK's exit from the bloc next March. While the UK government says it is 95% agreed - they have been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, if a future trade deal is not ready in time.On Friday, transport minister Jo Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU, quit the government saying he could not support the deal and called for another referendum.Meanwhile Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker and Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP - whose party's support Theresa May relies on for key Commons votes - have written a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph warning they are prepared to vote down any deal over proposals to manage the Irish border issue.On Saturday, Jeremy Corbyn was quoted in Der Spiegel, having been asked if he would stop Brexit, as saying: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Asked if Brexit could be stopped on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Thornberry said the results of the referendum should be ""abided by"" but there had to be an ""injection of democracy"" in between that result and going any further. That should be a ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament, she said. But she said Theresa May was only offering a choice between the UK ""falling off a cliff"" - with no deal agreed - or ""get on this bridge to nowhere"", by backing her deal. She said Labour would refuse to ""play that sort of game"" and, if the vote was lost, the party wanted a general election.She added: ""If we don't have a general election, which we think we should have, then yes of course all the options remain on the table and we would campaign for there to be a People's Vote but, you know, there are several stages before we get there."" The People's Vote campaign group organised the march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people. The group wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. Ms Thornberry said Mr Corbyn's comments had to be seen in context and he was explaining that: ""We had a referendum, that we are democrats over and above everything else."" At the Labour Party conference in September, party members approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Mr Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote.Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer wrote in the Sunday Times: ""There is no duty on MPs to surrender to a bad deal."" Instead, he said that MPs would be able to table motions, press amendments and trigger a no-confidence vote in order to prevent the UK leaving without a deal at all.Sir Keir said: ""I remain as convinced as ever that the consequences of no deal would be so severe that it cannot be allowed to happen.""But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told the BBC that people would have to consider a deal as a whole, stating: ""They need to think about what the alternatives are as well.""It is no good just not liking individual aspects. If you're going to take that view, you have got to have in mind a realistic, viable, deliverable alternative.""I think people are going to be getting behind this deal and saying 'yeah, let's get on with it'.""He added: ""It is not necessarily going to be something everybody is going to think is absolutely perfectly what they want.""But that's the nature of these things, there are some trade-offs.""

Thankfully it did not prevent our brave heroes from doing their job. https://t.co/2wd6Yq9VK3End of Twitter post  by @Tobias_EllwoodThe criticism from Mr Ellwood, a former soldier, follows a scathing rebuke from Sir Nicholas Soames, a grandson of the wartime British leader Sir Winston Churchill.The MP tweeted that Mr Trump was not fit to represent the US and said that he was a ""pathetic inadequate"" for not defying the weather ""to pay his respects to the fallen"".They died with their face to the foe and that pathetic inadequate @realDonaldTrump couldn’t even defy the weather to pay his respects to The Fallen #hesnotfittorepresenthisgreatcountryEnd of Twitter post  by @NSoamesThe US president also received backlash from Americans, like former diplomat Nicholas Burns, who said it was the leader's duty to honour their soldiers.Ben Rhodes, who served as a deputy national security adviser under former US President Barack Obama, also hit back saying weather was not an excuse.Did the President really not visit the American military cemetery today in France?  It is his duty to honor our soldiers who fought in 1917-18.

2018-11-11,WW1 hero finally added to MPs' memorial,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46149900,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA forgotten hero has finally been remembered on Parliament's World War One memorial.The marble installation recognises the sacrifice of peers, MPs, MPs' sons, and senior officers of Parliament, who died in service during the Great War.But 96 years after its completion, a leading historian realised one MP had been left off.Now Lieutenant Gerald Arbuthnot, once the Conservative MP for Burnley, has had his name belatedly added.The 44-year-old was killed in action in 1916 during the Battle of the Somme.Dr Kathryn Rix, from the History of Parliament Trust, spotted his name's absence from the memorial and said it's not clear why he was forgotten.""I think perhaps it was because he wasn't an MP for very long,"" she said. ""Perhaps people didn't remember he was an MP between January and December 1910.""Also he was a former MP at the time and they weren't originally added to the memorial in 1921.""But then some former MPs were added in 1922, so really, he should have been added at that time.""They just forgot him - which is rather sad - but now he is being remembered.""The historian had been researching the stories of parliamentarians killed in action during the war when she realised a name was missing from the memorial, known as the Recording Angel, which was designed by Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921.She had a list of 24 members and former members of Parliament who had died but noticed only 23 on the memorial in St Stephen's Porch, Westminster Hall. She said all of Parliament's official documents and guidebooks will now need to be amended, adding: ""It's really nice to have added him now. I feel very proud.""After unsuccessfully contesting the seat in 1906, Gerald Arbuthnot was elected as the Conservative MP for Burnley in January 1910. However he lost the seat in December of the same year during a second election.He chose not to stand again, but remained in politics in other ways until the outbreak of war, when he joined the Navy.But Dr Rix explained: ""He's unusual amongst the MPs who died in that he served in the Navy, He'd served in the Navy as a young man, and at the start of the war he joined the Royal Naval Reserve.""He was initially with their press bureau, but that wasn't involved enough in the fighting for him. So he joined a minesweeping division and commanded minesweepers in the North Sea for 15 months.""But he was very keen to go and have active engagement with the enemy. So he secured a commission in the Grenadier guards in January 1916.""By May, the former MP was fighting at Ypres before heading south to the Somme, with the 2nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards.On 25 September 1916, he was involved in a second attack on the village of Les Boeufs.Lt Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward to cut through barbed wire, because it had not been sufficiently damaged by the British artillery bombardment.Dr Rix explained: ""This was a job that they knew meant almost certain death. Arbuthnot and three other officers went forward. Three of them were killed.""The soldier is buried in the Citadel New Military Cemetery in Fricourt.Despite memorial services for him in Burnley and at St Margaret's Church in Westminster, his name was never added to Parliament's memorial.With the error noticed just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the Armistice, extended members of Lt Arbuthnot's family have welcomed his name being added.His distant cousin James - now Lord Arbuthnot - was himself an MP for 28 years.But in all that time, he never realised the memorial he routinely passed should have carried his relative's name.Long read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video: War footage brought alive in colour Interactive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?Living history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended Lord Arbuthnot said: ""I didn't know of him, though my brother did - he's the family genealogist. ""It's an extraordinary story. He was part of a generation who truly believed in duty and serving their country. ""It feels very good - an extra bit of knowledge about what members of Parliament, what my family, did in that war has come to light and we can remember him properly now.""We're very proud. Though I always remember my grandfather who died at Ypres in 1915, to know there was also Gerald Arbuthnot is really very nice.""There were a number of my family members killed in the First World War. It's just good to be able to join him to the family memory."" In total, 264 MPs or former MPs served in World War One, with 23 of these making the ultimate sacrifice. In addition, 323 members of the Lords served, with 24 being killed (one of whom was also an MP - meaning some list 24 MPs as having died). Mark Collins, the Parliamentary estate's archivist and historian, said: ""With the work of the History of Parliament Trust, we're sure that we have all of the names of those peers and those MPs and the sons of MPs [who died]. All their names have now been included."""
2018-11-11,'Travesty' not to have new Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46162114,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK needs to ""pause and reflect"" before doing something ""irrevocably stupid"" over Brexit, Jo Johnson said a day after quitting as a minister.On BBC Radio 4's Today he called again for another referendum, saying what was being offered fell ""spectacularly short"" of what had been promised.The ex-transport minister said it would be a ""democratic travesty"" to not have another vote.He denied his actions amounted to a coup against the prime minister.Mr Johnson, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, stood down as Theresa May's prospective deal with Brussels was being presented to Cabinet ministers.Mr Johnson warned the UK faced a choice between ""vassalage"" under her proposals and ""chaos"" if it left the EU without a deal.The MP for Orpington in Kent said he had ""happily taken the decision"" to end his own ministerial career and, when asked if he thought other ministers would resign, he said if they thought it was right thing for them to take a stand then ""good on them"".Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Mrs May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.Downing Street has insisted there will not be another referendum ""under any circumstances"". Asked whether he agreed with Mr Johnson's call, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Not really, no. The referendum took place. The issue now has to be how we bring people together, bring people together around the principles of our economy, our rights.""He said Labour would hold the government to account over any Brexit deal put to the Commons and could still vote against it.By Ben Wright, BBC political correspondentJo Johnson's resignation feels like a very significant moment. Here is a former Remain-supporting Conservative minister saying what others mutter privately about Brexit. His lacerating criticism of the government's negotiation and call for another referendum has opened another flank in the Tory party for Theresa May to worry about. Tory whips know many (40, 50, more?) Brexiteers are threatening to vote against any deal she gets from the EU in the Commons because they think it ties the UK too closely to the EU. But the whips must also worry about Remainer Tories determined to derail the whole thing because of the costs they fear Brexit will inflict on the country. With no majority in the Commons, No10's task could have just got harder.Mr Johnson's resignation also fires up those in all parties who say another referendum is now needed - a suggestion again slapped down by Downing Street. But right now, in the middle of this remembrance weekend, Mrs May will be relieved his resignation has not prompted others to follow him out of government. There has been no domino effect, yet.But while Westminster waits for the PM to put her final Brexit blueprint before the Cabinet for approval, these are febrile days.In a resignation statement on Friday, Mr Johnson, who is the brother of former foreign secretary and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson, argued Britain was ""on the brink of the greatest crisis"" since World War Two, saying what was on offer wasn't ""anything like what was promised"".Mr Johnson told Today: ""My view is that this is so different from what was billed that it would be an absolute travesty if we do not go back to the people and ask them if they actually do want to exit the EU on this extraordinarily hopeless basis.""Asked if his brother had lied to voters during the referendum, he said: ""In the campaign there were undoubtedly promises made that have shown to be undeliverable. No-one can dispute that.""It was a false prospectus. It was a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were. We are now faced with the reality of that in the form of a deal the prime minister is about to bring back before parliament."" Please upgrade your browserHe added he had become ""deeply concerned"" about the potential impact of a no-deal outcome while a minister.Conservative MP and leading Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and the former First Secretary of State Damian Green, both rejected another referendum.Mr Green told Today it ""would be divisive but it wouldn't be decisive"", and all the evidence showed the country was ""still, more or less, split down the middle"".Mr Rees-Mogg said Mr Johnson was ""re-heating 'Project Fear' to stop us leaving"".Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb."
2018-11-11,DUP leader urges PM to 'reflect' on EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46147628,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDUP leader Arlene Foster has said her party will ""not be able to support"" Theresa May's latest proposals aimed at resolving the Brexit deadlock.The party accused the PM of breaking promises over plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The plans were revealed in a letter from Theresa May to Mrs Foster, leaked to the Times.Downing Street reiterated the PM's commitment to avoiding a hard border. Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.Agreeing a backstop - a contingency plan designed to keep an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland until the UK and European Union settle their future relationship - remains the main obstacle in the way of a wider deal between the two sides.Mrs May describes it in her letter to the DUP as ""an insurance policy that no-one in the UK or the EU wants or expects to use"".The DUP leader said the party could not back the deal if it came before Parliament and said the PM ""needs to reflect"" on that.Mrs Foster told the BBC that a response to a letter sent to the PM last week ""unfortunately does say that she's in a position where she's considering regulatory alignment"".""We would not be able to support this if it came to parliament in the form that it is in the letter,"" said the DUP leader.""Now there are stages to go through before it comes to parliament. She still has to have a cabinet meeting in relation to this matter and we believe that there is a chance for her to reflect on the fact that we will not be able to support it in its current form.       Mrs Foster added: ""I believe that not only would we not be able to support what she has sent to us but that there are many others that wouldn't be able to support it in her own party as well.""If sufficient progress is made on the issue in the next few days, it is thought a special cabinet meeting could be held early next week for ministers to approve the draft agreement on the terms of the UK's exit.A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The government will not agree anything that brings about a hard border on the island of Ireland.""The UK and EU have failed, so far, to reach agreement on how to ensure there are no border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, if a free trade deal is not in place by the end of the post-Brexit ""transition period"" in December 2020. This is known as the ""backstop"".The EU's proposal, to keep Northern Ireland in its customs union and single market, is unacceptable to the UK because it would mean Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.But the UK's proposal, which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period after Brexit, includes an ""expected"" end date of 2021 - something which is unacceptable to the EU, which says any ""backstop"" must apply ""unless and until"" it is no longer needed.It says its Northern Ireland-only proposal should remain in place, in case the issue of the Irish border was not sorted out by that end date.The BBC's John Campbell said what was upsetting the DUP in Mrs May's letter was the issue of single market regulations, not customs.He said the letter suggested the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland may require alignment with EU single market regulations ""in some scenarios"" adding that any such alignment would have to be ""carefully circumscribed to what is strictly necessary to avoid any hard border"".The DUP has interpreted the wording of her letter to mean that the EU's proposal will be in the Brexit divorce deal, despite Mrs May's insistence it will never come into effect.BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the row came down to an issue of trust between Mrs May and her DUP allies, who were suspicious she might sign up to a deal with the EU they did not agree with.Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""We have always said that we can't accept the [EU] commission proposal for a Northern Ireland-specific solution."" Irish PM Leo Varadkar told a press conference: ""The most important thing to me is the objective, and that is to give everyone in Northern Ireland the assurance that a hard border will not develop between north and south, no matter what else may happen in the years ahead.""That is why we are seeking one that is legally operative and one that gives us that guarantee that is necessary."""

Cabinet ministers have been invited this week to read the UK's draft withdrawal deal with the EU. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland.On Friday the DUP, whose support Theresa May relies on for votes in the Commons, said they cannot support any deal which included the possibility that Northern Ireland would be treated differently from the rest of the UK.Mr Johnson, the MP for Orpington in Kent, said the choice being finalised was either:He described this as ""a failure of British statecraft unseen since the Suez crisis"" but said even a no-deal Brexit ""may well be better than the never-ending purgatory"" being put forward by the prime minister.But in a warning to his brother and fellow Brexiteers, he added: ""Inflicting such serious economic and political harm on the country will leave an indelible impression of incompetence in the minds of the public.""The ""democratic thing to do is to give the public the final say"", he argued.Analysis by BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergFor some time, Jo Johnson has struggled with the unfolding reality of Brexit.A well-respected and liked member of the government, he has decided that what was promised to people during the referendum campaign is now so different to what is on the table that he has quit the government instead.He's not the first, nor the best-known minister to resign over Brexit. But to leave at this moment, right when Theresa May is trying to stitch together a final deal, could have a serious impact.Read Laura's full blogHe added: ""This would not be about re-running the 2016 referendum, but about asking people whether they want to go ahead with Brexit now that we know the deal that is actually available to us, whether we should leave without any deal at all or whether people on balance would rather stick with the deal we already have inside the European Union.""Britain stands on the brink of the greatest crisis since the Second World War. My loyalty to the party is undimmed. I have never rebelled on any issue before now. ""But my duty to my constituents and our great nation has forced me to act.""In response, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The referendum in 2016 was the biggest democratic exercise in this country's history. We will not under any circumstances have a second referendum. ""The prime minister thanks Jo Johnson for his work in government."" Mr Johnson is the sixth minister in Theresa May's government to resign specifically over Brexit, following David Davis, Boris Johnson, Philip Lee, Steve Baker and Guto Bebb.For Labour, Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said Mrs May had ""lost all authority and is incapable of negotiating a Brexit deal within her own party, let alone with the EU"".But asked in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel whether he would stop Brexit if he had the chance, Jeremy Corbyn replied: ""We can't stop it, the referendum took place.""Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, whose party supports calls for a ""People's Vote"" on the final deal, said: ""We warmly welcome Jo Johnson's support of the campaign to give the people the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit.""This is a fascinating situation in which Jo and his sister are united in opposing their brother Boris and his Brexit plans.""Brexiteer Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns tweeted that she did not agree with him about another referendum - but his intervention highlighted unease on both sides of the debate, with the PM's efforts to secure a deal.And pro-Remain Conservative Anna Soubry supported his decision and said it was time for another referendum.Huge respect for @JoJohnsonUK .

During her trip to France, she and French President Emmanuel Macron paid their respects at the Thiepval Memorial, which commemorates more than 72,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers.  Mr Macron's British great-grandfather, Bristol-born butcher George William Robertson, fought at the Somme and was decorated for bravery. He stayed in France after the war.Long read: The forgotten female soldier on the forgotten frontline Video: War footage brought alive in colour Interactive: What would you have done between 1914 and 1918?Living history: Why 'indecent' Armistice Day parties ended In the ceremony at Mons on Friday morning, the prime minister - accompanied by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel - laid wreaths at the graves of Londoner John Parr, the first UK soldier to be killed in 1914, and the last, George Ellison.  Mr Ellison, who was born in York and lived in Leeds, was killed on the Western Front at 09:30 GMT, before the Armistice came into effect at 11:00, 100 years ago this Sunday.  The two men's graves are opposite each other at the cemetery.  Messages on poppy wreaths were taken from poems, with the one on Mr Ellison's grave bearing lines from Laurence Binyon, reading: ""They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted. We will remember them."" Mrs May chose lines from Rupert Brooke's sonnet The Soldier for Mr Parr's grave, writing ""in that rich earth a richer dust concealed"". On the way to the cemetery in Mons, a policeman on a motorbike was hurt when a vehicle tried to drive between Mrs May and Mr Michel's convoys - not realising there were two separate convoys.A spokesman for Mr Michel said the policeman and another officer, who was also on a motorbike, ""had to manoeuvre so as not to crash into that car"" and ""narrowly escaped crashing into the Belgian prime minister's vehicle"". The officer fell off his bike and was ""injured but not heavily so"", the spokesman said. Mr Michel got out of his car to make sure the policeman was OK and waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mrs May and her companions were in front so did not see what happened but were briefed afterwards.Mrs May and Mr Michel later attended a reception, where they met British and Belgian serving members of the armed forces.The prime minister then travelled to France to meet Mr Macron in Albert, a town in the heart of the Somme region of France which suffered heavy bombardment during World War One. Mrs May and the French president had a private meeting and working lunch before attending the war cemetery. The two leaders then attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the nearby Thiepval Memorial.A wreath combining the poppy and le bleuet (or cornflower) - the two national emblems of remembrance for Britain and France - was made for the occasion.On the wreath, Mrs May left a card with an extract from poem A Soldier's Cemetery by Sergeant John William Streets, reading: ""There lie the flower of youth, the men who scorn'd to live (so died) when languished liberty.""Mrs May said the visit was a chance to reflect on the time the countries spent fighting side by side in Europe, but also to look ahead to a ""shared future, built on peace, prosperity and friendship"".She said the ceremony at Mons was ""a fitting and poignant symbol"" for ""every member of the armed forces who gave their lives to protect what we hold so dear"".""We remember the heroes who lost their lives in the horror of the trenches. As the sun sets on 100 years of remembrance, we will never forget their sacrifice."" "
2018-11-11,UK economy grows at fastest rate since 2016,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46151172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to September, with warm weather boosting consumer spending, the Office for National Statistics said.The figure for the third quarter is in line with predictions from the Bank of England and other forecasters. However, buoyant growth in July was offset by a slowdown in August and September.It is the highest quarterly growth figure since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the economy grew 0.7%.Analysts warned the economy had ""little underlying momentum"" and growth would decline in the final three months.The ONS also issued a separate monthly figure for September, which, like the previous month, showed zero growth.Services, which make up three-quarters of the economy, only grew by 0.3% in the three months to September. After a slow start to the year, construction activity grew by 2.1% in the quarter. Manufacturing also picked up after a slow second quarter, thanks to strong car manufacturing numbers for the quarter. Household spending grew by 0.5% in the quarter, but business investment shrank by 1.2%, suggesting uncertainty among companies over the effects of Brexit.Business investment had been expected to rise by 0.2%, according to forecasts. It has now contracted for three quarters in a row.Simon Jack, business editorThe overall picture is one of an economy still recovering from an exceptionally weak, weather-affected start to the year. Construction and energy production both had a strong quarter and the weather played its part again in July, as sunshine and the World Cup boosted consumer spending. It's the strongest quarter for nearly two years, but the economy didn't keep up the strong momentum of July, with August and September registering no additional growth at all. Worryingly but perhaps not surprisingly, business investment was down sharply, matching anecdotal evidence of firms' caution ahead of Brexit. Although car production was up compared with the second quarter of this year, it is down compared with the same period last year and domestic car sales were very weak - it's exports that are keeping the car industry ticking over. Plenty for the chancellor to be cheerful about today, but a third quarter of falling business investment - the first time that's happened since the financial crisis - shows that firms think the sun may be shining now, but big clouds are looming.  Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""Today's positive growth of 0.6% is proof of the underlying strength in our economy. We are building an economy that works for everyone, with 3.3 million more people in work, lower unemployment in every part of the country, and wages rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade.""ONS head of national accounts Rob Kent-Smith said: ""The economy saw a strong summer, although longer-term economic growth remained subdued. There are some signs of weakness in September, with slowing retail sales and a fallback in domestic car purchases.""However, car manufacture for export grew across the quarter, boosting factory output. Meanwhile, imports of cars dropped substantially, helping to improve Britain's trade balance.""Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""Two consecutive months of stagnation in GDP underline that the economy has little momentum and that the strong quarter-on-quarter growth rate simply reflects the weather-related rebound in the summer.""The expenditure breakdown of GDP, meanwhile, shows that business investment fell by 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q3, taking the total decline since the peak in Q4 2017 to 2.4%. The risk of a no-deal Brexit is the clear driver of the downturn.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It remains likely that the stronger growth recorded in the third quarter is a one-off for the UK economy, with persistent Brexit uncertainty and the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses likely to weigh increasingly on economic activity in the coming quarters."""

""We all have different ways, mine is Lego.""The Conservative MP also said claims that he did not read any newspapers were ""complete nonsense"".Mr Wright, whose department is conducting a review of the future economic viability of the press, raised eyebrows last month when he told a media conference he did not subscribe to any newspapers or magazines.He told Talk Radio that he had given a straight answer to a straight question when he was asked if he had read a newspaper on the morning of the Society of Editors event in Salford.""The answer I gave was I didn't read a newspaper that morning which was true,"" he said. ""To suggest that I don't read newspapers is complete nonsense, of course I do.""What politicians do in their spare time is a subject of enduring interest and occasionally political significance. For some, it is watching their local football team - if they can remember which one they support - or going to the opera. For the prime minister, it is famously walking in the Welsh, or Swiss or Italian hills. The former attorney general, and father-of-two, has a more unusual hinterland for a 46-year old but one which most parents will be able to identify with.

2018-11-11,Raab under fire over Dover-Calais comment,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46142188,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowDominic Raab has come under fire for saying he ""hadn't quite understood"" how reliant UK trade in goods is on the Dover-Calais crossing.The Brexit Secretary's remarks came at a technology conference as he discussed the ""bespoke arrangement"" the UK sought with the EU after it leaves the bloc.Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman suggested Mr Raab ""doesn't even understand the very basics of Brexit"".Conservative pro-Remain MP Nicky Morgan tweeted: ""Gulp.""According to the Institute for Government, Dover is ""a key artery for UK trade heading to continental Europe"" with more than 2.5m heavy goods vehicles passing through the port every year.Its report says goods worth £119bn passed through the port in 2015, ""representing around 17% of the UK's entire trade in goods by value"".Mr Raab told a technology conference on Wednesday: ""We want a bespoke arrangement in goods which recognises the peculiar, frankly, geographic, economic entity that is the United Kingdom.""We are, and I hadn't quite understood the full extent of this, but if you look at the UK and if you look at how we trade in goods, we are particularly reliant on the Dover-Calais crossing.""And that's one of the reasons why, and there's been a lot of controversy about this, but one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we have a very specific and very proximate relationship with the EU to ensure frictionless trade at the border, particularly for just-in-time manufacturing goods whether it's pharmaceutical goods or perishable goods like food.""""I don't think it's a question so much of the risk of major shortages but I think probably the average consumer might not be aware of the full extent to which the choice of goods that we have in the stores are dependent on one or two very specific trade routes."" Dover is indeed an important port for the UK. It is by far the biggest UK destination for roll-on roll-off ferries, handling 2.9 million lorries last year. Of the 120,000 cargo-carrying vessels that arrived in the UK in 2016, 13% of them came into Dover, writes Anthony Reuben.But that doesn't make Dover the biggest freight-handling port. In fact last year it was only the ninth biggest by tonnage, handling 26.2 million tonnes, which is about 6% of the total amount of freight handled at UK ports. Those specialising in containers and other forms of bulk freight such as Grimsby & Immingham, London, Southampton and Liverpool handled considerably greater tonnage.Dover is vital for trade with Europe though, particularly for time-critical items. Its freight also tends to be high value, handling 17% of the UK trade in goods.Among critics seizing on the remarks, Will Straw - who was executive director of the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign during the 2016 referendum - suggested Mr Raab should have ""done your homework before backing Leave"". The Freight Transport Association's Pauline Bastidon said the group was ""relieved to learn that the secretary of state for exiting the EU has finally recognised the importance of the Dover strait and frictionless trade for the UK economy"".She added: ""While looking at all potential contingencies is right, no other route provides the same frequency of crossing or is able to handle the same volumes as Dover-Calais, Dover-Dunkirk & Eurotunnel put together. The government now needs to make good on its pledge of frictionless trade."""
2018-11-11,"UK must be able to end backstop, says Fox",https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46145284,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK must have the power to end any post-Brexit ""backstop"" customs accord with the EU on its own, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said.  The Brexiteer said the UK had voted to leave the EU and ""that decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else"".The UK and EU want to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit but cannot agree on how to do so.The EU has said it cannot agree to any arrangements which could be left unilaterally by the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to reach a withdrawal agreement with the EU this month. But her cabinet has been unable to agree on the mechanism for ensuring that there will be no return to border checks if a future trade deal is not ready in time.Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstopOne option could be for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border until a free trade deal is ready.But Leave campaigners want a clear exit strategy from any such arrangement.Mr Fox told reporters: ""We have an instruction from our voters to leave the European Union. That decision can't be subcontracted to somebody else. That needs to be an issue for a sovereign British government to be able to determine.""Earlier this week Simon Coveney, Ireland's foreign minister, tweeted that ""a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to"" by Ireland or the EU.In Paris earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said negotiations with the EU were ""in the final stage"" and he was confident an agreement could be reached. But asked if a deal could be reached in the next week, he said: ""I think seven days is probably pushing it but I am optimistic. I am optimistic that there will be a Brexit deal but I wouldn't want to be drawn on a specific timetable.""Mr Coveney told the Irish Canada Business Association conference in Dublin: ""I would urge caution that an imminent breakthrough is not necessarily to be taken for granted, not by a long shot.""Repeatedly people seem to make the same mistake over and over again, assuming that if the British cabinet agrees something, well, then that's it then, everything is agreed.""This is a negotiation and needs to be an agreement of course between the British government but also with the European Union and the 27 countries that are represented by Michel Barnier and his negotiating team.""Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019, as a result of the referendum in June 2016 in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union.Although 95% of a Brexit deal is said to be agreed, the backstop remains a sticking point.It is effectively an insurance policy that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a ""frictionless"" border.This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland, as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides.If a Brexit deal is agreed between the UK and the EU, it then has to be approved by the House of Commons and the remaining EU member states. Earlier, former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plan in July, told the BBC that defeat in the Commons for the current plan was ""looking like a probability"", especially if MPs were not shown the full legal advice on the Irish border backstop plan."

Jean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.Wartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said ""the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man"".During his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was ""a shorthand writer's dream"", and Mr Cole described her as ""as good as the men"", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff. Records suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.Mrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay. She sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was £250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.It is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.The amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.Mr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating ""practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men"".He added ""this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary"".Her call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.Her pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.Ms Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament ""cannot be run on the basis of equal pay"" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.In 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: ""I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.""In January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.Mrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland. From Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.Hansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said ""she was a woman who would not take no for an answer"".""As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,"" she said.

2018-11-11,The next Juncker,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46113924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEurope's centre-right parties are gathering in Helsinki to select their candidate in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission in 2019.  Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."
2018-11-11,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November. Afterwards, you can find it on BBC Sounds."
2018-11-11,Apple battle,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46043668,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government is preparing to launch a smartphone app to make it as easy as possible for EU citizens to apply to remain in the UK after Brexit - the only problem is it doesn't fully work on Apple devices.And hopes that the problem would have been fixed by now have just been dashed.The app is a key part of the government's drive to get the estimated 3.5 million EU citizens in the UK to apply for ""settled status"".App users answer three ""simple"" questions, take a ""selfie"" to be checked against Home Office records and then - if they have an Android phone - scan the chip on their passport to verify their identity. The Home Office says a decision will be made on whether they can stay in the UK within two weeks.As things stand, people with Apple devices will not be able to scan their passports and will either have to borrow an Android phone to complete their application or post their passport to the UK Visa and Immigration Service instead, meaning the process is likely to take longer.For those who are not sure, Android is the system that is used by Samsung, Huawei, Sony, Google and Nokia among others. They make up about 50% of the market in the UK, with Apple's iPhone making up the other half. The Microsoft and Blackberry operating systems for smartphones, which make up nearly 1% of the UK market between them, will also not be able to scan passport chips. Older versions of Android phones and some budget models are not fitted with a chip scanner either.Home Office officials knew there would be a problem with Apple devices when the app was announced early this year.But they were hoping Apple would release an update to its operating system to allow users of the firm's devices to scan their passports in the same way that people with Android phones can. The US tech giant has so far declined to do so, despite representations from UK government ministers, including a trip to the firm's Silicon Valley HQ by Home Secretary Sajid Javid.It is not a technical problem. Apple devices have been fitted with Near Field Communication chips, as they are known, since 2014.But the company has mostly limited use of the chip to Apple Pay transactions, for security and commercial reasons.There was speculation on tech blogs that Apple would unlock the chip reader to third party apps when it rolled out its latest operating system, 12.1, a process currently under way.But Apple has confirmed to the BBC that those rumours were not true and it has not been unlocked. Sources say the firm is continuing to work with the Home Office but would not be drawn on whether a solution is likely to be found before the UK leaves the EU in March.Home Offices sources told the BBC ""we are continuing to engage with Apple at the highest level"".But immigration minister Caroline Nokes, in a tetchy appearance before the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday, gave a hint of the frustrations at the top of government, after it was pointed out to her that only half of the intended audience for the new app would be able to use it.She told MPs the Home Office could not be blamed because Apple ""won't release the upgrade we need in order for it to function"".The Home Office has just finished private testing of the app, among 650 NHS and university workers in the North-West of England, and is now expanding the trials with a view to launching it to the wider public in the New Year. The Dutch government is also calling on Apple to unlock its chip reader to allow citizens to access its digital services.The Home Office also stresses that people will be able to use desktop computers to apply for settled status, although like Apple users, applicants will have to post their passports off rather than being able to scan the passport's chips.A Home Office spokesman said: ""EU citizens will be able to apply for that status using any smartphone, tablet or computer.""The app to check identity is only part of the process for those who choose to use it and there will be an alternative non-digital route available to all applicants to prove their identity.""The Home Office has also signed a £91m contract with French company Sopra Steria to set up a service at 56 local libraries, where library staff will help people who have already completed their visa application online to scan and submit their documentation and biometric data. The scheme will cover all visa applications, not just those from EU citizens.It means applicants won't have to post off passports and other documents, the company says, and can complete their visa application locally. But given how much emphasis ministers placed on the convenience and ease with which EU citizens would be able to apply by smartphone - and the sheer volume of people they need to process - the continuing issues with Apple have to be seen as a setback.They are also an illustration of the problems governments can encounter when their digital ambitions run up against the commercial priorities of the companies they need to deliver them."

The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the poorest will benefit the most as a proportion of their income. The Treasury's analysis of Budgets since 2016 suggests the poorest would do better, but its analysis of Budgets since 2015 suggests that the poorest will benefit less than many richer people.Much of the debate following the Budget on Monday has been about whether the measures announced will disproportionally favour people with high incomes. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that in fact it's the people on the lowest incomes who would proportionally benefit the most from the measures he announced, pointing out that he had put an extra £6.5bn into Universal Credit.The analysis published by the Treasury does not allow us to establish whether that is true for this Budget.The relevant chart in the Budget documents does not just look at Monday's Budget - it combines the impact of all the measures since the Autumn Statement in 2016. The Reality Check team asked the Treasury for the analysis of just Monday's Budget but was told it was not available.The chart divides the population into 10 equal groups and ranks them from the lowest income on the left to the highest on the right.The chart does indeed show that the poorest people are benefiting the most.This Treasury analysis does not just consider the value of changes to taxes and benefits - it also puts a cash value on the public services to which households have access. So, for example, the increased spending on the NHS will be counted as an increase in the value of services people get and hence a benefit from the Budget.Because public services are worth more to poor people in percentage terms than rich people, including benefits-in-kind automatically makes Budgets look more progressive. But that is not necessarily what people are thinking about when they ask whether the poorest people are going to benefit most from the Budget.Nonetheless, while the Treasury cannot provide figures to support the chancellor's claim about this week's Budget, if you include benefits-in-kind it may well be the case that the poorest people benefited most.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) looked at the impact of Monday's Budget alone, not including benefits-in-kind, and found that as a proportion of income it would be poorer households that would benefit the most. But the Resolution Foundation published similar analysis that suggested households with the highest incomes gained the most while the poorest gained less.It said that while the poorest would benefit from increases to Universal Credit, higher income households would benefit to a greater extent from the rising amounts that may be earned before income tax needs to be paid.The Treasury analysis started with the Autumn Statement 2016 because that was Philip Hammond's first Budget. It may be argued that it would make more sense to go back to 2015, because that was when measures such as the four-year freeze to working-age benefits and the two-child limit for benefits were announced.The Treasury does indeed publish this analysis, including measures that were announced before 2015, but implemented after then. It still includes benefits-in-kind from public services.This analysis finds that the 10% of households with the highest incomes lost the most, followed by the 20% of households with the lowest incomes.Going back to 2015 makes the changes look considerably less progressive than starting in 2016.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

2018-11-11,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-11,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181111234744/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

As one former minister said, ""two plus two is not suddenly going to equal five"".And at the top table there seems to be growing appetite for a change of approach. Three different members of the Cabinet have told the BBC that the PM has to ditch her plan. Carrying on like this, they suggest, is simply banging their collective heads against the same brick wall, because it will never get through Parliament.Some of them are even suggesting that the prime minister should consider walking away from the talks.

The government said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe.It has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut in the maximum stake would come into force in April - but the timing, announced in last month's Budget, has been criticised, with Sports Minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest.The Finance Bill is the legislation that puts the proposals outlined in the Budget into law.Senior Tories Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Justine Greening have backed the amendment, along with four DUP MPs.Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems.But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing.Labour's Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed-odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the MPs were trying to ""force the government into doing the right thing"".The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a ""very realistic chance"" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill.""There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency,"" she added.The government said it was making ""a significant change that will help stop extreme losses and protect the most vulnerable in our society"".The amendment will be voted on next week."

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.The two sides are trying to hammer out an agreement on the terms of the UK's exit in the coming days which could be put to a special summit of the 28 EU leaders at the end of November. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier told European ministers on Monday that intense negotiating efforts were continuing but no agreement had been reached and the EU must prepare for every possible scenario. Arriving for the meeting in Brussels, Brexit minister Lord Callanan said the UK was trying hard to get a deal but claimed it had not set a ""particular deadline"" and we ""have to take time to make sure its right"".But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said if no agreement was reached imminently, the reality was that things would get ""more ominous"" for Mrs May.While the UK's no deal preparations would have to be intensified, he said there were fears it would be harder to get MPs' support if the crunch Commons vote on accepting or rejecting the deal did not happen until the start of 2019. Labour leaders have said they are unlikely to support any agreement as it stands, with Sir Keir telling BBC Radio 4's Today that ""there is no duty to vote for the wrong deal"".The opposition has said it will press for a general election in the event of Parliament rejecting a deal but - if that does not happen - ""all options"" should remain on the table, including the possibility of a new Brexit referendum.Asked whether MPs would be able to force such an outcome, he said they would use the parliamentary process to ""assert themselves"" and, at the very least, ""indicate"" what should happen in the event of a deadlock.He suggested Mrs May herself would not be prepared to see the UK leave without a deal.""I am confident that the majority in Parliament will not countenance a no deal,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""So the question is can Parliament stop no deal if it becomes necessary? Absolutely.""If there was a motion that 400-plus MPs supported saying we do not countenance a no-deal, then the prime minister would have to go forward in the teeth of Parliament.""Of course I am critical of the prime minister on a number of fronts but I don't think she would simply take us out of the EU without a deal in the teeth of the vast majority in Parliament.""She has got a deep sense of duty. She knows the ruptures that would cause, not just on trade, but on security and counter-terrorism. She knows that.""Sir Keir acknowledged continuing divisions within Labour over the question of another referendum but insisted that the party had decided at its conference in September that it should not be ruled out. ""On this question of options on the table, we had a long, long discussion about it and we did agree all options to remain on the table including the option of a public vote.""The Labour Party has had a healthy discussion. But did we reach an agreement? Yes we did. Are we sticking to it? Yes we are. Neither Jeremy nor anyone else has altered that position, that is the position of the Labour Party."""
2018-11-12,Academic Scruton's housing role defended,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46128371,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters have defended the choice of Sir Roger Scruton to head a new housing body, amid calls for him to quit.The conservative academic was recently named as chairman of a new public body to encourage better designed homes.But Labour said past ""hateful"" comments about homosexuality, which he once said was ""not normal"", and Islamophobia, which he called a ""propaganda word"", raised questions about his suitability.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said his views had been misrepresented.The philosopher's character had been ""smeared"", Mr Brokenshire told MPs, saying he was ""uniquely qualified"" for the role because he was a world-leading authority on aesthetics. One of the UK's leading public intellectuals and the author of more than 50 books, Sir Roger was named as chairman of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission earlier this month. The unpaid appointment has divided opinion, with Labour and Lib Dem MPs saying he is unsuitable because of remarks he has made in the past on social, religious and moral issues.In an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2007, Sir Roger wrote: ""Every now and then, however, we wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal."" In an interview for online magazine Spiked in 2016, he said: ""Lesbianism is usually an attempt by a woman to find that committed love that she can't get from men any more.""In a 2005 lecture in the United States, he said date rape was not a crime and what ""supposed"" victims were actually saying was: ""'The whole thing went too quickly,' you know, 'I was not prepared,' and so consent is withdrawn as it were in retrospect.""Speaking in Hungary in 2016 on the future of Europe and the nation state, he made remarks about the financier George Soros which one Labour MP has said amounted to ""peddling anti-Semitic conspiracy theories"". ""Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,"" Sir Roger said.He added: ""As the world knows, indigenous anti-Semitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews.""Raising the appointment in the House of Commons, shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne suggested Sir Roger had made a number of other ""unacceptable"" comments, including ""speaking favourably"" of far-right movements such as the National Front.""If we are going to have a society which welcomes free speech, we should hold people to account for what they use that privilege to say,"" he said.His Labour colleague Clive Efford said what was at stake was not defending freedom of speech but whether someone who had ""extreme views"" was suitable for a high-profile public role.But a succession of Conservative MPs offered their support to Sir Roger, saying the selective quotes cited by his critics were not a proper reflection of his arguments. Jacob Rees-Mogg said as a philosopher his role was to ""advance debate and discussion"" on difficult issues, while Bob Seely said the government should not allow itself ""to be bullied by the thought police rent-a-mob"".Mr Brokenshire said ""due diligence"" had been carried out before the appointment and ministers did not have to agree with all Sir Roger's ""strong and controversial views"", some of which he said he had changed his mind on, to recognise the contribution he could make.  ""It saddens me that someone who has done so much to champion freedom of speech, expression and thought should be subject to such misinformed, ill judged and personal attacks we have seen over the last few days.""Sir Roger has said he is ""offended and hurt"" by suggestions that he is any way anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, insisting ""nothing could be further than the truth"".In a statement on his blog last week, he said: ""If people actually read my comments regarding the interplay between George Soros and Hungary, they will realise they are not in any way anti-Semitic, indeed quite the opposite.""My statements on Islamic states points only to the failure of these states, which is a fact. ""My views on Islam are well known and can be found in my book The West And The Rest."""

The uncertainty has been reflected on the financial markets, with sterling falling 1% against the dollar. before recovering slightly. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Negotiations are continuing on the so-called ""divorce"" agreement and an outline declaration on the two sides' future relationship. The next 48 hours are set to be critical in the process. Both sides want to schedule a special summit of EU leaders at the end of November to sign off the withdrawal deal but the EU says it will only agree to this if agreement can be reached on the issue of the Irish border. Time is running out to put the wheels in motion for the summit.EU member states need time to scrutinise any agreement before the gathering and the European Council's president Donald Tusk has reportedly said a deal must be reached by Wednesday evening at the latest.Following an update by their Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday, EU officials played down talk of a breakthrough, saying ""intense negotiating efforts continue, but an agreement has not been reached yet"".However, the Financial Times reported that Mr Barnier told EU diplomats that the text of an agreement was ""almost ready"" and everything hinged on whether Mrs May could muster enough political support in the UK. A November summit is a key staging post in trying to avoid the UK leaving without a deal. If the decision is pushed back to the next scheduled meeting in December, no-deal preparations will have to be ramped up significantly and the chances of getting it through the UK and EU parliaments will recede.Please upgrade your browserThe negotiators have been burning the midnight oil in search of a deal. Talks continued to nearly 03:00 GMT on Monday and have since resumed in Brussels.The EU said key issues remained ""under discussion"", in particular over finding a solution to avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Downing Street said some progress had been made but the proposed Irish backstop - a fallback arrangement for avoiding border checks, which would see the UK remain in a temporary customs arrangement - had not been agreed. Amid claims a special cabinet meeting scheduled for Monday to approve the deal had had to be postponed, No 10 said ministers would only be asked to approve the draft agreement when it was ready. Other sticking points include EU demands for a ""level-playing field"" in labour regulations and environmental standards during any temporary customs arrangement, so UK firms cannot undercut their European counterparts. Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said it was a ""very important"" week for the Brexit process and the sooner the two sides bridged their differences the better.Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure from both Brexiteers and Remainers.In his latest column for the Daily Telegraph, Boris Johnson called for a ""cabinet mutiny"" against the PM's proposal for the UK to sign up to EU rules in trade in goods without, he said, having any say in them. Mr Francois, the vice-chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, said it was an open secret that five or six cabinet members were very unhappy with the PM's proposals and urged them to show ""moral courage"". ""It's been one tactical defeat after another,"" he said. ""Everyone of which has been followed by a retreat. And it all ends in one massive surrender right at the end.""International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the cabinet would be a ""check"" on whatever deal was agreed and suggested she could not support anything which did not respect the 2016 referendum result.""Cabinet's job is to put something to Parliament that is going to deliver on the referendum result,"" she said. ""We need to work together as a Cabinet to do that.""Former education secretary Justine Greening, who backs another referendum on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU, said there was ""no chance"" of the PM's blueprint for future relations being approved by MPs.But Mrs May has received the support of one prominent Brexiteer in the cabinet. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said she was trying to get the ""very, very best deal"" for Britain.It's not only Conservative divisions which are on show over Brexit. Labour continues to struggle to read from the same script when it comes to another UK-wide vote.In an interview with a German magazine on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn said the public had already had their say and Brexit could not be stopped. He later told Channel 4 his priority was the UK's new relationship with Europe. Sir Keir Starmer, the party's Brexit spokesman, disagrees, pointing out that Labour members voted to keep all options open at their conference and Parliament would not allow the UK to leave without some form of agreement. And former prime minister Gordon Brown believes another referendum is inevitable at the some stage, although he will not predict when this might happen.In a speech to the Institute for Government in London on Monday, he claimed Brexit was now ""more divisive"" than either the Iraq War or the Miners Strike and  the door must be left open to the UK rejoining the EU one day.Referring to Mr Corbyn's remarks, he said. ""Jeremy always told me we should be bound by conference motions. He needs to look at the conference motion."""

The ban is set to be extended to schools and hospitals next summer.Wales would be the first part of the UK to ban smoking in city centres if the proposals were implemented.Ministers banned smoking in enclosed public places in 2007.Mr Drakeford tried to legislate for a partial ban on e-cigarettes in 2016, but the law was binned after members of Plaid Cymru withdrew their support.His manifesto proposes to ""extend [the] smoking ban to outdoor areas of cafes and restaurants and city and town centres"".""It is very important that we press ahead with reducing the level of smoking here in Wales,"" Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales.He denied he would want to ban it outright. ""We already have bans on smoking on beaches in parts of Wales. This is a proposal to take this further,"" he said.But UKIP assembly leader Gareth Bennett said: ""As health minister, Mr Drakeford led a crusade against vapers, and now he wants to hit smokers by a ludicrous ban on people lighting up in outdoor places such as cafes.""Other proposals in the manifesto, launched in Barry on Monday, include installing drinking fountains across Wales.He said he would consider requiring all new homes to have fibre broadband connections.Mr Drakeford's document makes no specific mention of the M4 relief road - despite a decision looming on whether to go ahead with the scheme.Instead, it says the government would ""maintain our commitment to tackle congestion,  particularly in areas such as on the A55 in north Wales, the A40 in mid and west Wales and the M4 in south Wales"".""Being in power is an opportunity, not a right"", Mr Drakeford wrote.""We must use every day we have, and every lever we have, to make Wales a more equal, fair and just society."""

This was a breach of confidentiality rules, it said.A separate report by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Conduct, which looks at appropriate sanctions, recommended he should be expelled from the House of Lords, saying the ""allegations taken together constituted a grave abuse of power"".After an appeal by Lord Lester, the committee agreed with the commissioner's verdict but changed the sub-committee's recommended sanction from expulsion to suspension.In a statement, Lord Lester said: ""I produced evidence which clearly demonstrated that what I was said to have done 12 years ago did not happen.""Independent counsel who previously advised the committee on its procedures provided an advice which concluded that the investigation was flawed. I regret the committee's conclusions in the light of these materials.""He called for reform of the procedure for investigating sexual harassment claims, adding: ""I hope to be judged by my work over decades for gender equality, race relations and free speech.""A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""Anthony Lester has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats and is no longer a member of the Liberal Democrat group in the House of Lords."""
2018-11-12,Lobby group admits unlawful whistleblower dismissal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46187870,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA major right-of-centre lobby group linked to a network of Brexit campaigners has admitted illegally sacking the whistleblower who first revealed allegations of unlawful referendum campaign spending.Shahmir Sanni was fired by the TaxPayers' Alliance after revealing his concerns that the official Brexit campaign, where he had previously volunteered, had broken electoral law. In his employment tribunal claim, Mr Sanni said the TPA had unfairly dismissed him after his decision to go public - and the organisation was part of an attempt to smear him.The lobby group now faces paying damages to Mr Sanni after an Employment Tribunal judgement last Thursday confirmed it would not contest his claims. Mr Sanni volunteered to work for Vote Leave, the official Brexit campaign body, during the referendum. He was then asked to work for Be Leave, an organisation targeting young voters.After the referendum, Mr Sanni supplied evidence to the Electoral Commission and the media that the two organisations had broken spending rules - and were in effect jointly run.In July, the commission - the independent watchdog that monitors ballot box fairness - found Vote Leave and Be Leave had committed ""serious breaches"" of the law by working together, and therefore overspending, and it called in the Metropolitan Police.After the referendum, Mr Sanni took a job with the TPA - a group which campaigns for lower taxes and highlights examples of government waste. He later told its chief executive, John O'Connell, about his plan to go public with his evidence of suspected breaches of electoral law. According to legal papers in the case, Mr O'Connell then advised Mr Sanni not to do so.The Employment Tribunal was told that after he disclosed his suspicions in the media, Mr Sanni was sacked by Mr O'Connell.In the legal papers, Mr Sanni said he'd been unfairly dismissed because he had exposed wrongdoing which had reflected badly on his employer because of its association with other pro-Brexit groups. Lawyers for Mr Sanni told the tribunal that if the TaxPayers' Alliance fought the case, they would demand disclosure of communications between nine organisations linked to the same Westminster officers, 55 Tufton Street, which shared political goals, including leaving the European Union. These groups would typically attend a regular co-ordination meeting as part of their political campaigning.""The claimant believes that some or all of the nine entities materially influenced the TaxPayers' Alliance's decision to dismiss him,"" the tribunal was told.""The claimant believes that his [whistleblowing was]... discussed at a Tuesday meeting, and that a concerted response... was discussed and agreed between the nine entities, and that this response included his dismissal,"" the tribunal was told.  Jonathan Isaby, the former head of the TaxPayers' Alliance and now editor of Brexit Central, told the BBC the Tuesday meetings were not as described in the legal action and denied they played any role in the affair. ""In a personal capacity I chair the monthly Tuesday meeting of individuals on the broad centre-right with an interest in public policy, which is typically attended by anything between 40 and 100 people,"" said Mr Isaby.""Attendees advertise recent policy work, promote forthcoming events and occasionally hear from guest speakers.""I can categorically state that Mr Sanni has never been the subject of a discussion at any such meeting.""Shahmir Sanni has previously also alleged that after his decision to go public he was outed as gay in an official Downing Street communication. He is still pursuing a separate legal action in relation to his outing. A spokesman for Downing Street has said it cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.""I have been denigrated by former colleagues in print and on television as a liar and fantasist,"" said Mr Sanni in a statement.""I was threatened with a libel suit for saying that I would be instigating this litigation. But when confronted with the reality of having to defend their actions, the TaxPayers' Alliance saw there was no chance that they could successfully do so.""They folded at the first opportunity, and are now avoiding any further questions about their funding and a shadowy network of right-wing organisations.""In its legal papers, the TPA confirmed that it would not fight the employment case - although it insisted that its decision to concede was based on ""pragmatic grounds"".In a further statement to the BBC, Mr O'Connell said that concessions on points of employment law did not mean ""we conceded on the entirety of their original submission""."

Parts of Theresa May's plan were described as ""worrying"", ""disappointing"" and ""concerning"" by members of her top team back in July.Mrs May is struggling to broker an agreement on Brexit with ministers.Two ministers have told the BBC they believe there is little chance the deal would get Parliament's backing.One of them said it was ""self-harming"" for the PM to keep pursuing the same strategy.Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month.Her preferred plan for future relations with the EU after Brexit were agreed at Chequers - the prime minister's country retreat - in July, in a marathon cabinet meeting lasting nearly 12 hours.Afterwards, Mrs May said the cabinet had reached a ""collective"" agreement, although former Brexit secretary David Davis and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson resigned from the Cabinet in protest at the plans 48 hours later. And, according to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, cabinet sources have now revealed there were widespread doubts about various aspects from many other ministers from the start, including from some former Remain supporters.For many of those present, she said that the Chequers deal was an undesirable compromise, rather than a set of proposals to which they were signing up with enthusiasm. One cabinet minister said the group endorsed the proposal ""with a very heavy heart"".Trade Secretary Liam Fox expressed strong doubts about elements of the plan for trading arrangements as they could harm the ability of the UK to do trade deals after Brexit.Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who backed Remain, is understood to have had some similar views, describing the proposal for a common rule book with the EU for parts of the economy as ""very worrying"" and suggesting that there should be a review of the arrangements after five years. The leader of the House of Lords, Baroness Evans, is understood to have agreed, telling her colleagues that she found it difficult to accept some aspects of the proposals, and might struggle to explain them in Parliament. Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey - Brexiteers who have both been reluctant to give public support for the plan - are said to have expressed significant unhappiness and questioned whether Brexiteer MPs would be able to support such a deal in Parliament. Please upgrade your browserMeanwhile, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is said to have warned his colleagues that as many as 40 Eurosceptic MPs might ""go on strike"". Sources close to him would not confirm that, but said he had been ""extremely cautious from the start"" about the Chequers proposal. And as has previously emerged, the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, said that she ""hated"" the proposals and called on the prime minister to treat those who had voted for Brexit with respect. Chancellor Philip Hammond told his colleagues that the government was living on ""borrowed time"" because some businesses were hesitating over whether to invest in the UK. He argued for the Chequers approach to bring clarity as soon as possible. But he is understood to have questioned whether such a deal could actually be achieved, warning that the UK would have to persuade EU member states to defy the European Commission which is running the negotiation. And the Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson - also a former Remainer - said there were many concerns with the paper and it must be made clear it was as far as the government would be willing to compromise. Several ministers on both sides of the argument are understood to have called on the prime minister to be honest with the public about the shift in position towards a closer arrangement with the EU. Mrs May is trying to arrange an agreement in cabinet on the current negotiations in time for a hoped-for summit in Brussels later this month.A Number 10 spokesman said: ""Everyone has to move a little to get a deal that works for everyone on both sides of the argument."" But Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said it appeared Mrs May had proceeded without the ""solid backing"" of her cabinet, having also declined to get Parliament's support for her negotiating objectives. Sir Keir also said the option of a fresh referendum was still ""on the table"", despite Labour's leader Jeremy Corbyn saying at the weekend that Brexit could not be stopped.In his column for the Daily Telegraph on Monday, Boris Johnson called the prime minister's deal ""a recipe for continued strife, both in the Tory Party and the country"".And former cabinet minister John Whittingdale cast doubt on whether Mrs May could stay in office if Parliament rejected any deal she reached with the EU.""I think if the PM's Brexit plan doesn't get through Parliament, I think it's quite difficult to see how the prime minister can continue because she has staked her credibility,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.

""But their calculations are unclear and deliberately opaque. And, indeed, the current situation in the cull zone says there is an increased prevalence.""So, either their figures were calculated on an extremely inaccurate basis and they've got it very badly wrong, or they have actually gerrymandered those figures to make it look as if the incidence is falling when the evidence clearly shows that the prevalence has gone up. ""Badger culling has not worked. They are issuing barefaced lies in this matter."" The letter to chief vet Dr Christine Middlemiss goes on to accuse Farming Minister George Eustice of giving misleading comments in September about a report produced by Defra's own scientists at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).Mr Eustice had said: ""Today's figures showing reductions in TB cases in Somerset and Gloucestershire are evidence that our strategy for dealing with this slow-moving, insidious disease is delivering results.""However, the  APHA report he quotes from explicitly states, ""these data alone cannot demonstrate whether the badger control policy is effective in reducing bovine TB in cattle"".On 29 October, Defra went further in a statement to BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme when it indicated that the alleged reduction in TB cases was due to the badger culls: ""The findings published in September showed that initial [badger] culls in the Higher Risk Area (HRA) have had a positive impact on disease incidence.""  The department has not mentioned that instances of TB have been rising in a cull area in Dorset. Dr Chris Cheeseman is former head of Defra's wildlife epidemiology unit and advised the department on its TB strategy for more than 40 years. Now retired, he is able to speak freely about the badger cull policy.""Defra has been cherry-picking the science since they started culling,"" he told BBC News. ""The fact that they are rolling it out on such a vast scale is a travesty of the available science.""In response, a Defra statement said: ""The latest statistics showed reductions in new outbreaks of bovine TB in the initial cull areas, an encouraging sign that the steps we have taken have had a positive impact.""Based on this scientific data, Minister Eustice was absolutely correct to describe this progress as encouraging.""Environment Secretary Michael Gove commissioned an independent expert review earlier this year of Defra's efforts to control cattle TB - which will be published tomorrow.Dr McGill's group has also raised concerns that new research adds to evidence that a skin test widely used by the department to detect the presence of TB in cattle is much less effective than claimed. On Defra's TB Hub, it is stated that effectiveness ""lies between 52% and 100% with an average of about 80% sensitivity at standard interpretation"".But two new research papers indicate that the average effectiveness may be much lower, between 50% and 60% at best.Jan Bayley of the Animal Welfare Group, which is campaigning against the cull in Gloucestershire, says that Defra is missing many cases of TB in cattle with these tests.She said: ""Farmers are being told that their herds are TB-free. They then go down with disease three or six months later and they automatically assume it's got to be badgers. ""Defra is really not explaining to farmers that there is a high probability that those herds are still infected.""Defra conceded in a paragraph of a consultation paper published in 2016 - but not widely publicised - that most new TB cases in high-risk areas were probably due to infected cattle: ""This substantial probability of 'residual' herd infection contributes to the high rate of recurrence seen in the high-risk areas, where nearly 60% of TB breakdowns (TB cases) occur in herds.""Much of the new work on the effectiveness of the skin test was conducted by Defra's own scientists at APHA in Surrey. Defra declined a request by BBC News to speak directly to the researchers involved, although the department's press officers did offer to mediate written questions.A spokesperson explained that it was against the civil service code for civil servants to speak to journalists without the permission of ministers. This includes instances where the research is publicly funded and published in peer-reviewed journals.Former Defra scientist Dr Chris Cheeseman said he regarded this as a misuse in the application of the civil service code: ""When I was a scientist working for governments, I always maintained the principle that I stuck to the truth. ""I think it's outrageous that the government should gag in any way scientists who work for them, either independently or directly. I think that's completely unacceptable in a democracy.""Defra responded: ""Any requests to interview civil servants are handled in line with the civil service code. This states that civil servants must not make any public statement which might draw upon experience in their official capacity without the prior approval of their department.""As a starting point, the views of the civil servant as to whether they would consider accepting the request would be taken into account.""Follow Pallab on Twitter"
2018-11-12,Universal credit 'pushing up rent arrears',https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-45893616,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowCouncil tenants on universal credit have on average more than double the rent arrears of those still on housing benefit, a BBC investigation has found.In Flintshire, north Wales, one of the first counties to test the new payment, the council says rent arrears have gone up by £1m.One claimant there said a mistake left him with just £29 a month to live on.But the UK government said it had listened to concerns and universal credit was working well.The BBC contacted every local authority in the UK that has council homes about their arrears. The results from the 129 councils that responded showed the average amount owed by tenants claiming universal credit across the UK is £662.56. For those still on housing benefit it is £262.50Flintshire council said this week that tenants on universal credit in the county owe on average four times as much rent as those on the old benefits. At times it has been even higher; in September it was six times as much.In the 18 months since universal credit was introduced in Flintshire, the council's rent arrears have increased by £1m, something officials say is largely due to the new benefit.Universal credit, which had cross-party support when it was first proposed, brings together six benefits, such as job seekers allowance, child tax credits and, crucially, housing benefit, into one payment.To mirror being paid a salary, it is paid once a month - in arrears.While this has worked for some, other claimants have said it is this delay in the payment, combined with confusion over the online application process, that has seen families left with no income for weeks, forced to turn to food banks and choose between paying bills or paying their rent.Universal credit was rolled out to job centres in Flintshire in April 2017, meaning the local authority is ahead of much of the UK. Eighteen months on, 23% of benefit claimants are now on universal credit in Flintshire, compared with about 10% nationally.Currently one million people across the UK claim the new benefit, a figure that will eventually rise to eight million. Experts and council chiefs are expressing alarm.One person caught up in the universal credit confusion is single dad James McDaid.He stopped work to look after his two-year-old son, and says he immediately ran into trouble when he made his first claim.He received £579 a month, out of which he had to pay £550 in rent, and then buy food and pay other bills.Unable to find out why his payment was so low and forced to turn to the local food bank to have enough to eat, Mr McDaid said he had to wait for months while his claim was processed.""If there weren't places like this [food bank] you'd be in trouble,"" he said. ""It's quite distressing, you panic about things.""It's not fair to have that amount of stress. It's just mayhem because you just don't know if you're going to end up on the street or not.""For fellow universal credit claimant Anthony Smith, the prospect of living on the streets is even closer.After struggling to cope with the online application process, and being sanctioned for missing meetings, which he accepts made things worse, Mr Smith owed £4,000 in rent when Panorama spoke to him.""I can quite easily see myself being evicted,"" said Mr Smith, 63, who has worked all his adult life. ""I've even looked for somewhere to live and I've found a bridge where I can live.""The only thing I'm not playing ball with is I can't use a computer. I'm left behind.""Not long after he was interviewed, Mr Smith was told he would be evicted.Partners Anita Igbinoba and Richard Onwuemene had to rely on universal credit when a car accident prevented Mr Onwuemene from working. The couple said because of the way the benefit is calculated monthly, their first payment left them short and struggling with bills.Ms Igbinoba said: ""That [£53] was all we got. We couldn't pay council tax which we owed, we couldn't pay rent. Nobody listened to us, the bills were just going up and up and up. We couldn't get out of it.""I'd sell things around the house just to make money to put in the electric for that week.""Universal credit is different because the amount for rent is paid straight to claimants, rather than direct to the landlord, like housing benefit.For those who struggle to keep their finances in order - like Keith Barber who suffers from depression - it can lead to financial trouble.""There's a fair chance the council won't be getting it [the rent],"" said Mr Barber, 56, who lives in Deeside.""I'm just terrible with money - I can't budget at all.""Keith has missed appointments with the Job Centre and his local council. He now owes more than £1,000 in rent and is also facing eviction.Neal Cockerton, head of housing at Flintshire council, is facing a double problem of tenants who cannot pay their rent and may have to be evicted, and a growing hole in the council's finances.In 2017 the authority's rent arrears stood at £1.6m. That figure is now more than £2m.Flintshire council said this week that those on universal credit in the county owe an average of £1,473 as opposed to tenants on the old benefits, who owe £334.Mr Cockerton and his colleagues now increasingly have to take the difficult decision to evict tenants who cannot keep up with their rent payments. Evictions have increased by 55% compared to the same time last year.""We do undertake a lot of intensive support before we get to that stage (eviction), but there is a degree of inevitability,"" he said.""There's a bit of an ostrich situation that develops - you put your head in the sand and it will go away. It won't go away, the rent has to be paid.""Because universal credit is claimed online, the council has also had to employ four new staff to help with applications and arrears, another cost at a time when budgets are stretched.The government has given them more funding to offset this, but the council said not only is it not enough, it is stopping in April 2019.Panorama has also discovered that the government knew rent arrears caused by universal credit could be a problem.Prof Paul Hickman of Sheffield Hallam University was asked by the UK government to look into the progress of the new benefit. His study, in 2011, found only 8% of tenants who made seven or more rent payments managed to pay their rent in full.He said the UK government had these figures but still went ahead with universal credit.""Were we ignored?"" said Prof Hickman. ""Some of what we said was listened to but I think they were so committed to the course of rolling out universal credit so in some senses, whatever we found they were going to continue to plough ahead.""I think realistically given the billions that have been spent in terms of implementing it, it's not going to happen... but I would probably scrap it.""The government has delayed migrating the majority of claimants over to universal credit for another year, as well as announcing more money for improvements to the system. Employment minister Alok Sharma said the new benefit is working, and claimed the rise in rent arrears is only temporary. He said: ""Universal credit is working well. What we have is a system which is simpler, a system which people understand and ultimately makes sure they get into work faster and stay in work longer.""After a period of time people will on average see those (rent) arrears coming down. But the key point here is to make sure that people get support in terms of funding, and that is why early this year we introduced a package worth one and a half billion pounds which means that anyone who's coming onto universal credit who is currently receiving housing benefit will get an extra two weeks of run-on - two weeks of extra money.""When questioned about direct payments to claimants, the minister said: ""We have listened and made sure that it is possible for direct payments to be made to their landlord and that is actually happening across the country.""Watch BBC Panorama's The Universal Credit Crisis on Monday at 19:30.

They are: a pre-Christmas deal with the EU, or an admission that a deal is not possible.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Today programme on Monday that in this scenario Parliament would take over. Downing Street has a ready response to that idea: only the government has executive powers to negotiate, so Parliament has limited influence.But parliamentarians on all sides have been holding talks among themselves and with Commons officials over the last year, working out just what Parliament could do in the event that MPs reject every option on the table: deal and no deal.John Bercow, the speaker, has been consulted by senior parliamentarians. He has been told that around this time in the Brexit calendar he may well find that the executive is so ""enfeebled"" that Parliament may have to take over.I am told that the speaker has listened with great care to MPs but has been careful not to reveal his hand. Senior Commons officials have suggested that unless Parliament is able to amend legislation then the ability of MPs to shape Brexit will be limited. This explains why the government is so keen that its ""meaningful"" vote should be held on a non-amendable, take-it-or-leave-it basis.Senior pro-European MPs are hoping that the speaker will break with convention and allow MPs to hold votes with bite. Tory and Labour MPs have been looking at the way in which the Labour frontbench has successfully forced the government's hand in recent months - requiring ministers to publish government documents - through a parliamentary device which petitions the Queen.Brexiteers in cabinet view the speaker with great suspicion and believe he is biding his time to help Remainers in the Commons. It should not be forgotten, however, that the speaker's diminishing set of friends on the Tory side include Brexit supporters. They also have his ear.The greatest hopes among MPs hoping that Parliament may take over rest not in the arcane world of Commons rules and procedures, but in the simple belief that no government can function without the support of Parliament. Many MPs have cast aside Erskine May, the bible of Parliamentary procedure, and have instead chosen to look to history for inspiration. Their book of choice is Six Minutes in May which describes how Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain in May 1940 after the debacle of the Norway campaign. A vote on the most neutral motion of all - whether to adjourn the Commons - was held. Chamberlain won. But the catastrophic loss of support on his benches and elsewhere spelled the end. The Six Minutes, as Jim Naughtie wrote in the New Statesman, refers to the length of the Commons voting division measured by an egg timer on the clerks' table.In May 1940 it was soon clear what should happen. The person from the largest party who could command the greatest support across Parliament - even though he had been at the heart of planning the Norway operation - succeeded Chamberlain. Churchill became prime minister.Even though Boris Johnson likes to think of himself as a 21st century Churchill there is no such figure on the horizon. We can expect lots more fog before another moment of clarity arrives."
2018-11-12,Record setter,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-parliaments-46139815,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThis Saturday, 10 November, is 2018's Equal Pay Day in the UK.After this date, women will effectively work for free until the end of the year because of the gender pay gap.It is 100 years since some British women first got the vote under the Representation of the People Act, so seems an ideal opportunity to celebrate a woman who played a vital, yet unsung, role in Parliamentary history. Jean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.Wartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said ""the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man"".During his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was ""a shorthand writer's dream"", and Mr Cole described her as ""as good as the men"", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff. Records suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.Mrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay. She sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was £250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.It is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.The amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.Mr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating ""practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men"".He added ""this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary"".Her call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.Her pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.Ms Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament ""cannot be run on the basis of equal pay"" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.In 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: ""I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.""In January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.Mrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland. From Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.Hansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said ""she was a woman who would not take no for an answer"".""As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,"" she said.

Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy.

2018-11-12,I played the PM,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46071979,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHow do you play Margaret Thatcher, give a convincing portrayal of Winston Churchill, and avoid delivering a caricature rather than a performance?It's a question I've been exploring for I Played The PM on BBC Radio 4 Extra with some big names who've taken up the challenge.Gary Oldman and Meryl Streep took the UK's two most famous prime ministers to Hollywood. However, Winston Churchill was first portrayed on film in the 1930s; and Margaret Thatcher as a character made her big screen debut thirty years before Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady. In 1981, Mrs Thatcher is seen flirting with James Bond - or so she thinks - in a telephone call at the end of For Your Eyes Only.The film entered production in September 1980. The producers plainly thought Britain's first woman prime minister famous enough for a global audience to know, after barely 18 months in the job.Janet Brown, who plays her in the film, had a long acting career before she took on Mrs Thatcher, but it's really a comic impersonation. That's a problem all the actors I interviewed have wrestled with: how to play a well-known figure the audience are familiar with whilst adding something fresh and unexpected.""You're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't"", Patricia Hodge says of the challenge of giving an interpretation rather than an impersonation.  She was cautious when offered the role in The Falklands Play in 2002, and wanted to be sure that the production team weren't looking for an impersonator.Patricia says it helped that, throughout the play, the character is referred to only as ""Prime Minister"". It left her free to explore the part as a woman in power, rather than Margaret Thatcher specifically, even though it's clear - not least from the pussy bow blouse, the handbag and the hair - whom she's supposed to be.We're broadcasting the whole of the play as part of I Played The PM. Patricia Hodge is not just showing the public face - for example, berating General Al Haig, President Reagan's envoy, for treating the Argentine military dictatorship with it's appalling record of human rights abuses on the same par as the British government - but also the private Thatcher, agonising over whether to order the sinking of the Belgrano. These were controversial matters in real life, and one part of the explanation why Ian Curteis's brilliant and compelling drama took so long to be produced.Not every actor has been so fortunate in the amount of screen time they have to work with. When the novel The Line of Beauty was adapted for television, it fell to Kika Markham to make convincing a Margaret Thatcher who's as much a symbol of something as a real character. ""What was very important was getting in and out of cars"", she recalls. ""She doesn't mind looking people straight in the eye. Someone who is used to power, used to people standing up when she enters a room.""    Kika Markham laughs when she recalls the climax; Mrs Thatcher dancing with Nick, a character played by Dan Stevens, to the Rolling Stones track, Get Off My Cloud. ""I was told that she liked men,"" says Kika. Recalling Theresa May dancing on a visit to Africa this year, she wonders whether it's something women prime ministers think they have to do, showing a more relaxed side.Mrs May hasn't really been given the acting treatment so far, though you will hear Jan Ravens reveal the secret of her impersonation on Dead Ringers; it's all down to a very tense mouth and a harmonic speaking voice.The most contemporary prime minister to feature in I Played The PM is David Cameron. Greg Wise, an actor full of energy and with a puckish sense of humour, is no body double for the UK's most recent ex-prime minister. He was cast, he jokes, because like Mr Cameron, ""I went to public school"". In a 'what if?' radio play, broadcast a few months before Scotland's independence referendum, James Graham, the playwright, imagines what it would be like if a majority of Scots had voted ""Yes"". Dividing The Union, which we're also broadcasting in full, has David Cameron travelling to Edinburgh for independence negotiations with the then First Minister, Alex Salmond.  ""It is the realpolitik that we read about, that we never get to see; two guys in a room.""Greg Wise gave me a masterclass in radio acting; and he explained how he tried to get inside David Cameron's character to convey how he might have felt if that referendum had gone against him. I think the actor I met who had the hardest task was Brian Cox. The film ""Churchill"" was controversial among some historians because of its portrayal of the build-up to D-Day; and it was overshadowed by ""The Darkest Hour"", released more or less at the same time, and featuring Gary Oldman's Oscar-winning performance.Brian Cox's Churchill is every bit as compelling. The actor tells me he was trying to explore something different, a less confident wartime prime minister. Although he deliberately put on weight to help with the famous silhouette, he used a more naturalistic speaking voice, arguing that in his famous speeches, Churchill was performing a morale-boosting role.Brian offers a striking example of how actors come to feel a degree of empathy for a character they can be playing for months. Born in Dundee, a city Churchill represented in the House of Commons, he grew up in a family who  remembered the former MP with little affection. Yet when we're talking, it's clear that in many ways Brian Cox admires the man his Uncle Geordie used to denounce. As Patricia Hodge told me, when playing the PM, the character often ""takes you over"".Judge for yourself in I Played The PM, broadcast on Radio 4extra 0900 GMT to midday and again at 1900 GMT to 2200 GMT on Saturday 3, November.

2018-11-12,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-12,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181113005223/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

2018-11-13,Brexit text agreed in talks breakthrough,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46188790,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUK and EU officials have agreed the draft text of a Brexit agreement after months of negotiations.A cabinet source told the BBC that the document has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive discussions this week. A special cabinet meeting will be held at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday as Theresa May seeks ministers' backing.The PM has been meeting ministers in Downing Street for one-to-one talks on the draft agreement.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the agreement contained a UK-wide customs ""backstop"" aimed at preventing new border checks in Northern Ireland.There is no additional Northern Ireland-only backstop - but sources wouldn't be drawn on any specific arrangements for Northern Ireland on rules and regulation within the UK-wide one, she added.This ""backstop"" has proved to the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.The pound surged against the dollar and the euro following the negotiations breakthrough - but analysts warned it could be short-lived, with the cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans.The EU said it would ""take stock"" on Wednesday, while the Irish government said negotiations were ""ongoing and have not concluded"".Leading Brexiteers, such as Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, immediately criticised what has been reported to be in the draft agreement, saying it would keep the UK under EU control. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which gives Theresa May vital support in key votes, said it would be a ""very, very hard sell"".But Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith said he was ""confident"" it would pass when put to a crucial Commons vote, and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling called for ""a little bit of calm"" before the cabinet gives its verdict on Wednesday.Both the UK and EU hope to be able to schedule a special summit of European leaders at the end of November to sign off the deal.The details of the draft agreement have not been published, so we don't know the small print yet.But it is made up of a withdrawal agreement - said to run to 500 pages - alongside a statement about what the UK and EU's future relationship will look like.The withdrawal agreement includes how to guarantee there will not be physical border checks reintroduced in Northern Ireland - the major sticking point in recent weeks.Some Brexiteers fear the likely arrangement will keep the UK locked into EU trade rules for years to come in order to maintain a frictionless border.The agreement also includes commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit, a proposed 21-month transition period after the UK's departure on 29 March 2019 and details of the so-called £39bn ""divorce bill"".The future relationship statement is expected to be far shorter, with the UK and the EU's long-term trade arrangements yet to be settled.No 10 said ministers were now being called to a special meeting to ""consider the draft agreement the negotiating teams have reached in Brussels, and to decide on next steps"".Before they do so, they will be able to read relevant ""documentation"". By BBC political editor Laura KuenssbergIt doesn't seem to me that many of the cabinet are likely to walk on Wednesday over what's in the document.It's suggested that those with bigger doubts are more likely to cause problems for the prime minister because it won't get through Parliament.One source told me senior ministers are thinking not just about the wisdom of backing a deal they don't like because it's a sour compromise, but whether it is folly to back a deal they believe can't get through Parliament.Slamming on the brakes now would force a crisis, but it could be less serious than the political disaster of pursuing this plan to an eventual calamitous defeat that could take them all down.Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said the plan would see the UK remain in the customs union and ""large parts"" of the single market.He told the BBC it was ""utterly unacceptable to anyone who believes in democracy"" and he would vote against it.Mr Rees-Mogg warned of the UK becoming a ""vassal state"" with Northern Ireland ""being ruled from Dublin"".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""given the shambolic nature of the negotiations, this is unlikely to be the good deal for the country."" Pro-EU Conservative MP Justine Greening said the agreement would leave the UK with less influence and undermine its credibility.Speaking at a rally calling for another EU referendum to be held, she said: ""Even if some people in my party can't see this is a bad deal, everyone else around this entire planet can.""Former Transport Minister Jo Johnson told the audience at a packed Westminster Hall that cabinet ministers were ""looking deep into their consciences"" about whether to support the deal.Mr Johnson, who quit his ministerial role last week over Brexit policy, added: ""The whips are going to tighten the thumbscrews on all our colleagues across Parliament in all parties probably, so it is very hard to predict.""BBC Europe editor Katya AdlerBrussels is keeping schtum this evening. This doesn't mean that nothing's going on. Those in the know simply prefer to keep quiet at this sensitive stage.It seems what is being described to me as a ""mutual understanding"" has indeed been reached on a technical level between EU and UK Brexit negotiators.This is not yet a deal. All eyes are now on the UK cabinet. If ministers reject the draft, then it's back to the drawing board.If they approve it, then the 27 EU ambassadors scheduled to meet tomorrow may be told by the European Commission that decisive progress has been made in negotiations, meaning a Brexit summit could be convened with Theresa May, possibly in less than two weeks' time.First though, all 27 EU countries and the European Parliament will want to pore over the text. And that won't be with an uncritical eye. Meanwhile, following pressure from all sides of the Commons, ministers have agreed to provide MPs with a legal assessment of the implications for the UK of the Irish backstop and other controversial aspects of any deal.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement to MPs and take questions ahead of the final vote on any Brexit deal.MPs, he said, would get to see ""a full reasoned position statement laying out the government's both political and also legal position on the proposed withdrawal agreement"".

2018-11-13,A brief guide to where we are with Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWe are now entering the Brexit ""endgame"", Prime Minister Theresa May tells us. What does she mean?The UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019.  The reason the UK is leaving is because people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice and what post-Brexit relations will look like. A deal has to agreed by negotiators but also by Theresa May's cabinet, then MPs and, finally, by the 27 other EU member states.A cabinet source has told BBC the text of the withdrawal agreement has been agreed at a technical level by officials from both sides after intensive talks this week. Theresa May is holding a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the agreement.Any hopes of an EU summit to sign off on a withdrawal agreement this month will apparently be hit if the talks go on much longer - there will not be enough time to set up a meeting of the 28 leaders.The next possible date for a meeting of EU leaders is in December, which could result in the Commons vote on any deal being delayed until after Christmas.With uncertainty over whether MPs would back a deal, missing this week's deadline would increase the chances of the UK leaving without one. The UK government would then step up no-deal preparations and spending. The sticking point over the Irish border. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with border posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.But the two sides have not been able to agree how they can guarantee this - with the EU insisting on a ""backstop"" arrangement which will kick in to avoid a physical border if whatever future trade deal the UK and EU agree does not manage to maintain the current border arrangements.The two sides are hoping to agree a rough outline of a trade deal to be signed off at the same time as the withdrawal agreement. If all goes as planned, the details will be hammered out after the UK leaves.Even if she does get her top team to sign off on a Brexit withdrawal agreement, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.She does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them.If the only choice presented to MPs is her plan or a no-deal scenario it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote.If she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.Some Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."

Sterling leapt 1.4% to trade at $1.3036 against the dollar in afternoon trade, whilst against the euro it jumped to a near seven-month high of €1.1542. The move came after a significant breakthrough in talks between UK and EU officials with the draft text of a Brexit deal agreed.But analysts warned the pound's rally could be short lived. ""With the UK Cabinet and Parliament yet to agree to the plans, we are clearly not out of the woods yet,"" said Capital Economics economist Ruth Gregory.She said she would not be surprised if a deal wasn't secured until ""well into"" next year, with the pound likely to ""pull back"" again by the end of the year. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, was also wary, warning Prime Minister Theresa May still had to convince party members as well as the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which props up her minority government.""Ms May's proposals are tasked with healing an increasingly divided Conservative party while also keeping the party's DUP allies onside,"" he said. Aberdeen Standard Investments political economist Stephanie Kelly. cautioned this wasn't a ""foregone conclusion"".""The devil will be in the detail of the Irish border issue. Everything hangs on that and ultimately whether Theresa May can get this past Parliament,"" The pound has been very volatile since the outcome of the referendum to leave the EU in June 2016, and remains around 10% lower against both the dollar and the euro since then.On Monday, fears that talks between the EU and the UK had hit a deadlock sent the pound tumbling.

Ms Onasanya, 35, denies one count of perverting the course of justice.Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said the MP and her brother Festus Onasanya had ""acted jointly in telling lies"".The court was told Ms Onasanya, who is the MP for Peterborough, was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) after her car was clocked by a speed camera in Thorney, near Peterborough, on 24 July last year.She returned the paperwork naming Aleks Antipow as the driver, jurors heard.Mr Jeremy said Mr Antipow was the previous tenant of a property that Ms Onasanya and her brother had rented in Cambridge.The court heard that Mr Antipow was at home in Russia at the time of the incident and had never driven the MP's car.Mr Jeremy said that providing a real name but false address and telephone number meant Mr Antipow ""would remain untraceable"", so that ""the true driver of Miss Onasanya's car would escape prosecution"".The court was told the MP's brother, Festus Onasanya, had also ""deployed the tactic"" when his car was caught by a speed camera on two occasions last year.Mr Jeremy accused Ms Onasanya, who is a trained solicitor, of ""adopting her brother's method of evading prosecution"".""The two of them were acting jointly in telling lies in order to prevent the prosecution of the true driver,"" he said.Mr Jeremy told jurors that Ms Onasanya was a busy person but had ""trapped"" herself in lies by adopting her brother's methods of making a speeding prosecution disappear.He said: ""This case may have started as a case about an offence of speeding.""It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying.  ""Lying persistently and deliberately. Lying all the way to this court, maybe about lying in this court.""On 5 November, Mr Onasanya, 33, of Chesterton, Cambridge, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to three counts of perverting the course of justice.Mr Jeremy told jurors: ""The question for you to decide in this case will be whether Festus Onasanya was acting alone or whether the two of them were acting together.""Mr Onasanya has been bailed until the end of his sister's trial, when he will be sentenced.The trial continues."

But they are not allowed to work, study or settle.Mr Timmermans told a press conference in Strasbourg: ""We propose to amend the visa regulation to allow UK nationals to be exempt from any visa requirement for short stays in the EU once EU law stops applying to the UK.""The measure would need to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states to take effect.The EU Commission said that if no deal was reached, this arrangement would start from 30 March, and if a deal was agreed, it would begin from the end of any transition period, which is currently scheduled to be at the end of 2020.Prime Minister Theresa May has promised the UK will ""regain control of its borders"" after leaving the EU and that the free movement rules that allow people to move between member states to live and work will no longer apply."
2018-11-13,Wages show fastest rise in almost a decade,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46193571,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWages rose at the fastest pace in nearly a decade in the three months to September, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, rose by 3.2% - the biggest rise since the end of 2008 and up slightly on the previous quarter.However, the ONS warned that real wage growth was below the 2015 level.The unemployment total went up for the first time this year, rising by 21,000 in the same period to 1.38 million.Compared with a year ago and adjusting for inflation, average weekly earnings increased by 0.9%. That figure excludes bonuses.""With faster wage growth and more subdued inflation, real earnings have picked up noticeably in the last few months,"" ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said.But Samuel Tombs, an economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says wages will ""struggle"" to accelerate much further.""Flows of people out of self-employment and into employee roles have remained strong, ensuring that record-high job vacancies don't lead to spiralling wage growth,"" he said.The ONS noted that the decline in workers from eastern European countries was ""accelerating"", while there had been an ""uptick"" in British nationals in work.The unemployment rate went up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the period from July to September. Two reasons largely accounted for this - the rising population in the UK and an increase in the number of men out of work.""Job creation since May has averaged just 2,900 a month. This slowdown in the number of new jobs opening up is likely to feed through into weaker consumer spending in the coming months,"" said Mike Jakeman, senior economist at PwC.Analysis by economics correspondent Andy VerityYou might well have expected it to happen. The prospect of Brexit and the weak pound seems to have put off some migrants from coming to the UK to work, while others have decided to return to their country of origin. Now we have the strongest evidence so far of that trend - with the number of EU nationals working in the UK falling by 132,000 in the three months from July to September compared with the same period a year before. While migrant workers coming from the rest of the world grew by 34,000 there is still a net outflow of migrant workers. And it is particularly striking when you focus on the so-called EU 8 - Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Based on ONS calculations, the number of workers in the UK from those countries (as opposed to more recent joiners such as Bulgaria and Romania) are down 173,000 from the record high of 1.05 million two years ago.There has been a range of views on the latest wage growth and unemployment figures.Employment Minister Alok Sharma said that ""the benefits of a strong jobs market are paying off"".He added: ""With more people now in work then ever before and unemployment almost halving since 2010, we are delivering an economy that gives people the opportunity of a better future.""However, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for a rise in the minimum wage to £10 and added: ""Boosting pay packets must be a priority. ""Pay is rising at a snail's pace and wages aren't expected to return to their pre-crash value for at least another six years.""Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the UK's impending departure from the European Union had played a part in the rise in the number of people out of work.He said it suggested that ""the UK jobs market may be starting to falter under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and chronic skills shortages"". The Recruitment and Employment Confederation highlighted what it said was a record number of job vacancies of 845,000 from August to October - the highest since comparable records began in 2001.Director of policy Tom Hadley said employers were ""continuing to experience fundamental challenges in finding the staff and skills that they need"". These skills shortages would ""further intensify over the next few months as EU workers no longer find the UK an attractive place to work"", he added."

The former minister was found dead at home days later.His family wanted their lawyers to be able to cross-examine witnesses as part of the process.It is believed Mr Sargeant took his own life.The AM for Alyn and Deeside, from Connah's Quay, north Wales, was suspended from the Labour Party and sacked from his cabinet job on 3 November.His family have said he was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself. The investigation, commissioned by Welsh Government First Minister Carwyn Jones, is to examine how Mr Sargeant's sacking was handled.Because of the legal action, it is yet to begin.Bernie Sargeant, Mr Sargeant's widow, fears the investigation will be a ""cover-up"".In court in London on Tuesday Mr Justice Supperstone granted Mr Sargeant's widow, Bernie, permission for a judicial review ruling, saying she had an ""arguable case"".Nathalie Lieven QC, for Mrs Sargeant, argued that the way the terms of the investigation had been set amounted to a ""flagrant breach of natural justice"".She said the first minister should not have a role in setting the operational procedure of the inquiry as there was a ""conflict of interest"".A full hearing is expected to take place in Cardiff in January, by which time Mr Jones will no longer be first minister.Neil Hudgell, solicitor for the Sargeant family, said: ""We're obviously pleased with today's outcome today, it's one hurdle overcome and now we get a full hearing. ""Hopefully the Welsh government will see sense in our arguments and come to the table with proposals that allow the inquiry chair to carry out a meaningful enquiry.""Tuesday's decision came after the family appealed a High Court judge's earlier dismissal of the family's request.An inquest into Mr Sargeant's death is due to start in a fortnight, with Carwyn Jones set to give a day of evidence.A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""The permission decision means simply that the court has found the claim to be arguable and a full hearing will now be arranged for January.""It would be wrong to comment further given legal proceedings are ongoing."""

She told the Times he had groped her and chased her around his kitchen when she spurned his advances.Days later the peer told her that if she slept with him he would make her a baroness ""within a year"", but if she refused he would ensure she never gained a seat in the Lords, she told the newspaper.Ms Sanghera, the founder the charity Karma Nirvana who was made a CBE in 2013, told the Times that Lord Lester's conduct ""made me feel physically sick"".""I was acutely aware of the power imbalance. If I'd said anything, who would believe me?"" she said.She finally lodged a complaint in November 2017 and said the rise of the #MeToo movement led her to hope that ""by speaking out, victims were creating a climate in which people were more willing to listen"".Lord Lester said the investigation was ""flawed"" and he had ""produced evidence which clearly demonstrated that what I was said to have done 12 years ago did not happen"".Lord Pannick QC, a friend and colleague of Lord Lester, said: ""It is impossible fairly and effectively to decide on the truth of allegations of sexual harassment said to have occurred nearly 12 years ago without allowing for the cross-examination of the complainant. ""The commissioner refused to allow Lord Lester to cross-examine and the commissioner failed herself to carry out that function. ""Such a process would not be acceptable in any other regulatory, disciplinary or employment context. Parliament has applied a procedure that would be invalidated by the courts if Lord Lester were to be suspended by his local darts club.""But Ms Sanghera's lawyer David Hooper said Lord Lester had previously defended the Lords' disciplinary procedures, when other peers were being recommended for suspension in 2009.""This is the procedure that has been chosen by the House of Lords,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""They wanted their own internal discipline. They didn't want the courts to start ruling on whether peers had or had not behaved properly.""  "

There are about 20 assaults on emergency staff in Wales every day, according to Rhondda MP Chris Bryant who tabled the private members' bill.North Wales Police has recorded 200 assaults on staff since April.These have ranged from being spat at to having a broken jaw, the force's Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Neill Anderson said.The new law makes attacks on emergency workers an aggravating feature in terms of sentencing, and introduces a new offence for minor assaults against them. It builds on the previous offence of assaulting a police officer, and also provides extra protection to unpaid volunteers who support the emergency services, including mountain rescuers and RNLI crews.An average of nine South Wales Police officers are assaulted each week, the force said.Chief Constable Matt Jukes added: ""Staff do not go to work to be assaulted or threatened.""Police officers and staff are people, and committed public servants - not punchbags.""Stuart Millington, senior operations manager for North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said workers ""should not be subject to abuse of any nature"".And Louie Platt, director of operations at Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said ""violence not only puts our people at risk, but prevents them from doing their job""."
2018-11-13,Tory rebellion over betting machines,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46184298,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government is facing a rebellion over the timing of its crackdown on fixed-odds gambling machines.Ministers have promised to cut the machines' maximum stake from £100 to £2 in October 2019 - but some MPs are calling for it to happen sooner.More than 20 Conservatives have joined opposition politicians in trying to bring the change forward to April 2019.They backed an amendment to the Finance Bill, which was tabled on Monday evening. The government said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe.It has denied that MPs were led to believe the cut in the maximum stake would come into force in April - but the timing, announced in last month's Budget, has been criticised, with sports minister Tracey Crouch resigning in protest.In her resignation letter, Ms Crouch suggested MPs who supported the betting industry had been ""more persuasive in their arguments"" to senior ministers - and it was this that had convinced them to opt for the later date.Scheduling the change for October means it will happen at the same time as increases in the amount of tax charged to gambling firms who are based abroad but operate in the UK.The government says doing it this way means the public finances will not be hit by a fall in the amount of tax coming in. Fixed-odds betting terminals generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and bring in taxes of £400m for the government.The Finance Bill is the legislation that puts the proposals outlined in the Budget into law.Senior Tories Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Justine Greening backed the amendment on Monday evening, along with four DUP MPs.Currently, people can bet as much as £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette. Anti-gambling campaigners say the machines let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems.But bookmakers have warned the cut in stakes could lead to thousands of outlets closing.Labour's Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on fixed-odds betting terminals, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the MPs were trying to ""force the government into doing the right thing"".The Welsh Labour deputy leader said there was a ""very realistic chance"" that MPs would back bringing in the cut to April 2019 when they discuss the Finance Bill.""There's a huge feeling in the House that this is the wrong decision and we need to implement it as a matter of urgency,"" she added.The government said it was making ""a significant change that will help stop extreme losses and protect the most vulnerable in our society"".The amendment will be voted on next week."

""But the issues aren't new.""It was a sentence he could have uttered almost every week for the past few months. So why is this any different?It's because the EU and UK negotiating teams really do appear to be quite close now to a deal on a withdrawal agreement. But the last few points are always the most difficult to resolve and the politics remain highly unpredictable.  If there is to be a special EU summit to finalise a Brexit withdrawal deal before the end of this month, then agreement at official level needs to happen in the next couple of days. Not only does an agreement have to pass muster within Theresa May's cabinet, it also needs to be sent to the capitals of the other 27 EU member states for line-by-line perusal. At the moment, the negotiations are taking place in what's been called ""The Tunnel"" in Brussels - meaning that little information is being passed on, to ensure that little information leaks out. But every country is going to want to take several days to make sure they can accept any final text.In particular, there are legal issues to overcome relating to the terms on which any temporary UK customs union with the EU could be brought to an end. EU countries will also want to ensure that a temporary customs union doesn't give the UK an unfair trading advantage. In other words, it is not just in London that searching questions will be asked. Please upgrade your browserIf it doesn't prove possible to get a tentative deal finalised in the next couple of days, that's not the end of the story. Attention will then shift to the next date in the diary - a regular EU summit scheduled to take place in mid-December.  On both sides, though, there are warnings that there will be a price to pay if negotiations last much longer. A lot more money will soon have to be spent - by both governments and businesses - to put contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit into practice. Until any withdrawal agreement is turned into a legally binding treaty, everyone will have to get ready for no deal, just in case. And that will take time and money.That's one of the reasons why the UK government is keen to get a withdrawal agreement approved by Parliament as soon as possible - ideally before Christmas. The numbers in the House of Commons, though, are too close to call. As for ratification on the EU side, the European Parliament says it will need six to eight weeks to complete the process. And it plans to vote on the issue in mid-March, just a couple of weeks before the UK is due to leave. And what if the negotiations run into the sand and even by the time the December summit takes place there is no text for EU leaders to approve?  In those circumstances, Christmas might not be the season of goodwill for those directly involved in the negotiations. But the next key date is 21 January. If there is no agreement by then, the UK government will be required to make a statement to Parliament about the next steps it plans to take. Whether or how MPs would be able to have a meaningful say in the process at that stage, possibly even trying to delay or stop Brexit, is the subject of considerable political debate. But after the end of January it would probably be too late to get a withdrawal agreement ratified before the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.  The government would not only have to win a ""meaningful vote"" on its deal with the EU in Parliament, it would also have to pass legislation giving the withdrawal agreement effect in UK law.One possibility is that the two-year Article 50 period (named after Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets out the terms on which a member state leaves the EU) could be extended. In theory, that could happen if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agree.But the government has already said it has no intention of asking for an extension of Article 50 and other countries would certainly not want to agree to anything open-ended - a few weeks at most, unless UK politics takes a sudden and unexpected turn.  That is a reminder that there is, of course, an alternative timeline.If parliament did vote against a deal brought forward by the prime minister, the UK would be faced with several alternatives.Either it could accelerate contingency plans and leave with no deal at all.Or it could change course and request an extension of Article 50 to allow for one of several possible options:It's all uncharted territory and that is why the next few days feel so critical.We've been talking about the cliche of the Article 50 clock ticking for more than 18 months. But the sound that you can hear is the ticking getting louder. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-11-13,Dangers for May,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46181271,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowOn our long stumbling journey towards Brexit, there are occasional moments of clarity which provide a flavour of what to expect next.The resignation of Jo Johnson will be remembered as the moment that showed Downing Street faces mortal threats from all sides.It had long been assumed that a hardcore band of Brexiteers posed the greatest challenge to Theresa May's plans.But the resignation of an unrepentant Remainer - pledging to oppose both no deal and her deal - shows that pro-Europeans may have parliamentary muscle too.With Tory Remainers, Tory Brexiteers and the Labour Party finding common cause in some, but not all, areas the prime minister could simply find that Parliament rejects the two most likely options she will put before MPs. They are: a pre-Christmas deal with the EU, or an admission that a deal is not possible.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Today programme on Monday that in this scenario Parliament would take over. Downing Street has a ready response to that idea: only the government has executive powers to negotiate, so Parliament has limited influence.But parliamentarians on all sides have been holding talks among themselves and with Commons officials over the last year, working out just what Parliament could do in the event that MPs reject every option on the table: deal and no deal.John Bercow, the speaker, has been consulted by senior parliamentarians. He has been told that around this time in the Brexit calendar he may well find that the executive is so ""enfeebled"" that Parliament may have to take over.I am told that the speaker has listened with great care to MPs but has been careful not to reveal his hand. Senior Commons officials have suggested that unless Parliament is able to amend legislation then the ability of MPs to shape Brexit will be limited. This explains why the government is so keen that its ""meaningful"" vote should be held on a non-amendable, take-it-or-leave-it basis.Senior pro-European MPs are hoping that the speaker will break with convention and allow MPs to hold votes with bite. Tory and Labour MPs have been looking at the way in which the Labour frontbench has successfully forced the government's hand in recent months - requiring ministers to publish government documents - through a parliamentary device which petitions the Queen.Brexiteers in cabinet view the speaker with great suspicion and believe he is biding his time to help Remainers in the Commons. It should not be forgotten, however, that the speaker's diminishing set of friends on the Tory side include Brexit supporters. They also have his ear.The greatest hopes among MPs hoping that Parliament may take over rest not in the arcane world of Commons rules and procedures, but in the simple belief that no government can function without the support of Parliament. Many MPs have cast aside Erskine May, the bible of Parliamentary procedure, and have instead chosen to look to history for inspiration. Their book of choice is Six Minutes in May which describes how Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain in May 1940 after the debacle of the Norway campaign. A vote on the most neutral motion of all - whether to adjourn the Commons - was held. Chamberlain won. But the catastrophic loss of support on his benches and elsewhere spelled the end. The Six Minutes, as Jim Naughtie wrote in the New Statesman, refers to the length of the Commons voting division measured by an egg timer on the clerks' table.In May 1940 it was soon clear what should happen. The person from the largest party who could command the greatest support across Parliament - even though he had been at the heart of planning the Norway operation - succeeded Chamberlain. Churchill became prime minister.Even though Boris Johnson likes to think of himself as a 21st century Churchill there is no such figure on the horizon. We can expect lots more fog before another moment of clarity arrives."

Jean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.Wartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said ""the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man"".During his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was ""a shorthand writer's dream"", and Mr Cole described her as ""as good as the men"", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff. Records suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.Mrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay. She sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was £250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.It is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.The amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.Mr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating ""practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men"".He added ""this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary"".Her call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.Her pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.Ms Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament ""cannot be run on the basis of equal pay"" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.In 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: ""I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.""In January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.Mrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland. From Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.Hansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said ""she was a woman who would not take no for an answer"".""As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,"" she said.

2018-11-13,The next Juncker,https://web.archive.org//web/20181114024149/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46113924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEurope's centre-right parties are gathering in Helsinki to select their candidate in the race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission in 2019.  Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

But one junior member of staff, who says she has experienced just such a culture within Westminster, has little confidence that anything will change. ""I think there's a kind of unspoken hierarchy between staff, [and that] whatever an MP says, goes,"" ""Katie"" tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.""It's very much seen that Members are the priority, and everyone is there to serve their interests.""""Katie"", which isn't her real name, has worked in an administrative role alongside some of the lowest-paid House of Commons employees such as Parliamentary receptionists, bar staff and cleaning staff for around two years.She now works elsewhere in the Commons, and says mistreatment of junior staff occurs on a daily basis - and that ""dealing with the abuse is just part of the job"".MPs and other senior individuals treat her and her colleagues with ""complete disdain"" because they are not of ""the same social ranking"", she claims.Katie describes one occasion when a senior civil servant shouted in her face and called her stupid.""I could almost feel, kind of like the spit landing on my face he was so angry… I'd only been in the job a few months and it was so overwhelming, scary that I just didn't know how to deal with it."" She ran to the ladies' toilets in tears.This was not the only time she felt belittled and intimidated. A peer in the House of Lords once asked her if she ""even knew what Brexit was"", she claims, while an MP said to her, ""Don't you know who I am?"" when she suggested he wear his Parliamentary security pass.Katie also claims that one MP is well-known for taking ""great joy"" in intimidating junior female members of staff, by stroking their hair and touching their lower back and shoulders - as though it is a ""game"".As far as she is aware no-one has complained about him because staff felt ""it wasn't their place to say anything"".In October, a report was published by Dame Laura Cox into bullying and sexual harassment in the Commons.It criticised a culture of ""silence"" in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour.Katie says her colleagues have experienced this.""Quite often, members of staff that I know have gone to their managers to ask for advice and are just told to ignore it and carry on going,"" she says.""It's not worth the hassle. In any kind of dispute like that, an MP would have the upper hand anyway.""The Commons Commission has backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones.Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon [and] for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament"".A House of Commons spokeswoman said it was ""committed to a robust effort to change the culture which has tolerated such abuses. ""The staff of the House of Commons are essential to the functioning of democracy. We deeply regret that their diligence has at times been so poorly repaid.""Katie welcomes Dame Laura's report, although she says she did not give evidence to the inquiry as she did not feel it was ""for people like her"".A spokesperson for Dame Laura said she regrets that she felt unable to come forward.Katie has no confidence, however, that the report will lead to change.""I don't think any investigations will happen, I don't think any MP will face any consequences,"" she says, referring to their ""air of superiority that they're above the rules"".She believes John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons - whose job it is to oversee reform of the culture in Parliament - should ""do the honourable thing"" and resign.He has himself been accused of bullying - allegations which he denies. Mr Bercow has told friends he intends to stand down as Commons Speaker next summer, the BBC understands, but Katie believes he should leave the post now. She says: ""How can anyone have confidence in a system that's being developed by people who've been accused of such actions themselves?""She's also critical of those MPs who want him to stay in his role until Brexit is complete, such as Labour's Margaret Beckett, who said negotiating a good Brexit ""trumps bad behaviour"".Katie says calling it ""bad behaviour"" undermines the bravery of those who have come forward to give evidence to Dame Laura.""The kind of constant bullying, driving people out of their jobs - it's horrendous, it's not just 'bad behaviour',"" she says.""It's creating a workplace that's intolerable and where people are completely susceptible to abuse with no recourse for action.""If this is to change, she says, so too must the culture of the Commons.""I think the idea of hierarchy is ingrained in all members of staff from day one,"" she says.""You learn that you're there to serve MPs, but that also means to not challenge them as well.""And so when this kind of behaviour is going on, that attitude still applies.""That attitude of not saying anything for fear of getting into trouble yourself or not being taken seriously is just pervasive, I would say.""Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

I'm told 9 ministers spoke against the agreement -  Fox,  Hunt,  Williamson, Penny Mordaunt, Javid,  Leadsom, Evans, Mordaunt and Grayling.End of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakIn her statement outside Downing Street, Mrs May said the agreed package was ""the result of thousands of hours of hard negotiation with EU officials"".She believed that ""this decisive choice is in the best interests of the entire UK"", adding: ""When you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear.""This deal, which delivers on the vote of the referendum, which brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union; or leave with no deal, or no Brexit at all.""The 585-page draft withdrawal agreement has now been published, alongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like.The withdrawal agreement covers so-called ""divorce"" issues. It includes a commitment to protect the rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living in the EU to continue living, working and studying.There is also a planned 21-month transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, and a ""financial settlement"" from the UK, thought to be between £35bn and £39bn.The most contentious part of the negotiations is a ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event this is not settled by a UK-EU trade deal.Please upgrade your browserBoth sides have resolved to ensure the backstop is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.Speaking at a press conference, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said if this is not possible by July 2020, the transition period could be extended - and if it is still not settled by the end of the transition, the backstop would ""kick in"".This would involve a joint UK-EU ""single customs territory"", so customs checks are not needed on the border.Northern Ireland would stay aligned to the EU single market rules that are ""essential for the avoidance of a hard border"", Mr Barnier added, saying the backstop plan was based on the UK's proposal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he did not think the agreement was in the national interest because it ""doesn't meet the needs of all parts of Britain"".Labour would reveal during Thursday morning's Commons statement whether it will vote against the agreement, he said. Some Tory MPs are angry, claiming it could mean the UK is tied to EU rules for years to come.Earlier a senior Conservative told the BBC there could be a move to a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May, perhaps as soon as Thursday,Meanwhile Mr Rees-Mogg, who has written to MPs urging them to oppose the proposals, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""a pretty rotten deal"", keeping the UK in the EU's customs union and ""splitting up"" the UK.Despite winning the backing of her cabinet, the prime minister faces a battle to get the completed deal through Parliament.Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - which gives the government the support it needs to win key votes - has joined opposition parties in criticising it.Senior DUP figures spent an hour in Theresa May's office after the publication of the draft text.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards.""Not long off call with PM. She tried to tell me Scotland’s ‘distinctive’ interests had been protected. I pointed out that there isn’t a single mention of Scotland in the agreement, that it disregards our interests, and puts Scotland at a serious competitive disadvantage.End of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonTheresa May is sure to face some hostile questioning when she faces MPs' questions on Thursday.Meanwhile, the EU has said ""decisive progress"" has now been made in the negotiations.This was the test required before it would call a special summit to agree the withdrawal plans, possibly later this month.After that, the government faces a crunch vote in Parliament where MPs will be asked to approve the plans.The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - at which point, if the withdrawal agreement has been ratified, the transition period begins.Do you have any questions about the draft withdrawal agreement?Use this form to ask your question: If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of the BBC website to submit your question on this topic.

Here's what happened.Mrs May's draft Brexit agreement was the only show in town - and Jeremy Corbyn went for it, despite the disadvantage - shared by everyone who is not in the cabinet or a select group of Tory backbenchers - of not having read it yet.He branded the draft agreement a ""failure on its own terms"", based on what we know about it, that ""breaches the prime minister's own red lines"" and doesn't protect jobs and industry. He asked: ""Does she still intend to put a false choice to Parliament between her botched deal and no deal?""The PM accused Labour of wanting to ""frustrate"" Brexit. Mr Corbyn quoted Jo Johnson who quit the government last week accusing the PM of a ""failure of statecraft"" of historic proportions - and said the EU's lead negotiator had reportedly told EU ambassadors ""the UK must align their rules with the EU, the EU will retain all the controls"".Mrs May insisted she had negotiated a ""good deal"" for the UK that delivers on the referendum and ensures we ""take back control of our money, law and borders"". Mr Corbyn turned to whether the UK can strike its own trade deals if it is in the temporary customs union as part of the so-called backstop to prevent the return of a hard Irish border.He asked a briefly silent Commons (this is a point Tory Brexiteers are keen to get clarified too) whether her agreement would ensure the ""sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop"".Mrs May said there needed be a backstop as an ""insurance policy"" but neither side wanted it it to be used.She said she was ""aware of concerns"" that ""we don't want to be in a position where the European Union would find it comfortable to keep the United Kingdom in the backstop permanently and that's why any backstop has to be temporary"".""I think that non-answer has confirmed that Parliament won't have that sovereign right,"" replied Mr Corbyn. What happened to the 40 trade deals Liam Fox had said would be ready to go ""a second after midnight"" on Brexit day next March, he asked.Mrs May said the UK had ""started discussions"" with other countries, before launching an attack on Labour's policy of being in a customs union, which she claimed would prevent trade deals.Mr Corbyn had some fun at the expense of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said last week he had not been aware of how much the UK relied on the Dover/Calais route for trade in goods.The PM insisted ""we do know about trade policy"" - before turning PMQs on its head by asking Mr Corbyn - in the light of apparent differences between him and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer - if it was Labour policy to ""stop Brexit"".Mr Corbyn said Labour respected the result of the referendum - and took another swipe at Mr Raab's ""woeful ignorance"". He ended with his first question - would MPs be presented with a choice between her ""half-baked deal"" or ""no deal""?Mrs May ignored this in favour of her customary swipe at Labour's economic policies and a defence of her Brexit agreement. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford also went on Brexit, calling for Scotland to stay in the customs union.Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone accused the PM of failing to deliver the Brexit people had voted for.The prime minister hinted that a planned crackdown on betting machines in bookmakers shops could be brought forward - after protests from MPs on all sides and the resignation of Sports Minister Tracey Crouch.Labour's Rosena Allin-Khan called for another EU referendum.Labour's Wes Streeting called for stricter controls on the sale of crossbows.Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:Jeremy Corbyn was on fire today. A series of pointed, well-delivered questions, including one on whether the UK could unilaterally leave the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement, which the PM danced around but didn't answer.The prime minister was in the awkward position of discussing an as yet unpublished and unagreed document, and she looked uncomfortable and, at times, cornered. She endured a very tough three quarters of an hour against opponents whose position was far more fluid than her's could be. I think we saw Jeremy Corbyn's position evolving a bit, before our very eyes. His warning that Labour would not accept a choice between the PM's Brexit deal or a no-deal Brexit opens up the prospect of an attempt to present some further option. But what? A new round of negotiation? Perhaps accompanied by an extension to the Article 50 deadline for Brexit? His aside that Labour respected the referendum verdict would seem to rule out a call for a second referendum. A number of his senior colleagues are attempting to waft him towards a very soft Brexit position, and maybe more; today they got some Remain body language.Even more ominous was the intervention that followed from Conservative Brexiteer backbencher Peter Bone. He normally wraps his political messages in a joke - this time he delivered a blunt, to-her-face warning that the PM's deal was unacceptable. It's the kind of attack from the benches behind that has failed to materialise at previous PMQs that may be a feature of future ones.The prime minister fielded questions about other issues - the horrible crossbow murder in Ilford, rolling stock in Elmet and Rothwell, viaducts in Eddisbury, disabled veterans and many more, but the Brexit questions kept coming. Several MPs quoted departed transport minister Jo Johnson at her, and the questions he raised will not go away. The PM could swat away outright calls for another referendum, but the SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, zeroed in on the idea that Scotland should have a similar customs union deal to that offered for Northern Ireland, an idea which alarms Scottish Tories, while Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts used a Brexit question to take a swipe at the Labour-led Welsh government in Cardiff.And at the end of it all a series of points of order established that the PM will probably be back tomorrow (Thursday) for a full-dress Commons statement on the deal - if it gets through Cabinet. This was a mere appetiser for what promises to be a gruelling ""til they drop"" ordeal."
2018-11-14,A guide to where we are with Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115033109/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has agreed a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement with Brussels, and her cabinet has backed it. What happens now?The UK is due to leave the European Union at 11pm on Friday 29 March, 2019. The reason the UK is leaving is because people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice and what post-Brexit relations will look like. A deal has been agreed by negotiators - it now has to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states. This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks.This would involve a UK-EU ""single customs territory"" - meaning customs checks would not be needed at the border. Northern Ireland would also stay aligned to some other EU rules, so checks on things like agricultural products and goods standards are not needed.The EU said this was ""indispensable"" to avoiding a hard border.But this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish sea.Theresa May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.They could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020.Alongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is a shorter document setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like. If this can be agreed in time, it would kick in after the transition period ends in December 2020.It envisages a ""a free trade area and deep cooperation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".There would be ""ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.The two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop.An EU summit is expected later this month to agree the text. But after that, Theresa May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it.She does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, have already said they are likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom.There has been talk of backbench Tories calling for the prime minister to go, and there could yet be resignations from the cabinet, with several known to have voiced concerns during their five-hour meeting in Downing Street.When it comes to the crunch Commons vote, if the only choice presented to MPs is Mrs May's version of Brexit or no-deal, it could frighten enough waverers into backing her. That's what Downing Street will be hoping. Labour and some Tories are trying to ensure other options are put to the vote as well.If she loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.Some Tory and Labour MPs hope she will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out."

We had a frank meeting tonight with the Prime Minister lasting almost an hour. She is fully aware of our position and concerns.End of Twitter post  by @DUPleaderBoth parties held the discussions at the prime minister's office in the House of Commons.The meeting, which lasted around an hour, took place after the text of the draft withdrawal agreement had already been published. Earlier, Mr Wilson said: ""I think people will be appalled at her words.""The party's ten MPs prop up the Conservative government under the confidence-and-supply arrangement, signed in June 2017.Sinn Féin leader, Mary Lou McDonald, said she had an ""initial conversation"" with Mrs May, and that she would ""resume conversation"" with Tánaiste (Irish deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney on Thursday. Speaking earlier outside No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" during a five-hour cabinet meeting.Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar welcomed the draft agreement, stating that it ""protects the fundamental"" aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. He said the backstop was ""now fully spelt out"".""Additional rules on goods will apply to Northern Ireland to ensure that there is no need for a border between north and south,"" he said in Dublin.""We have also agreed a review mechanism for the backstop if a better solution is found. It [a decision to make changes to the backstop] can only be taken jointly by the UK and EU.""Earlier on Wednesday, Mrs Foster said that she will ""not be led by the Irish government"" when coming to a view on the UK-EU draft Brexit text.She was speaking after the taoiseach said unionists should be assured that the text would not negatively impact the integrity of the UK.Mrs Foster had told reporters in the Commons, ahead of the text's publication: ""We're talking in a bit of a vacuum, we really do need to see that text.""""We are concerned about the narrative that has built up around the prime minister's proposal,"" she added.""We will make our own judgements, and we will certainly not be led by the Irish government who have been aggressive in all of this.""Mrs Foster said if Theresa May reneged on commitments she had made, there would be ""consequences"".The 585-page draft withdrawal agreement has now been published, alongside a shorter statement setting out what the UK and EU's future relations will look like.The detail relating to Northern Ireland starts on page 302. It addresses the Northern Ireland backstop - the insurance policy arrangement that aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic, in the event of the EU and UK failing to agree a deal on future trading relations.The backstop within the agreed draft would avoid a return to a ""hard border"" with the Republic by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.This has proven to be the most contentious part of the withdrawal negotiations, with concerns raised by Brexiteer Tories and the DUP over how it will work.But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said agreement on the backstop would protect the Good Friday Agreement and respect the integrity of the UK as a whole.He said the backstop would only kick in if there was no better solution by the end of the transition period in 2020 and is ""not meant to be used"".On Wednesday morning, Mr Varadkar appeared in Dáil Éireann (Irish parliament) to answer questions from opposition parties.He said he believed what the draft text included would not ""negatively impact"" the integrity of the UK.He said he recognised that ""for the unionist community this is quite a difficult time"".""I know many unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated and many may be quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days,"" he added.""I want to say to them - the Good Friday Agreement will be protected - it includes a recognition of the fact we respect the territorial integrity of the UK and the principle of consent, that there will be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people say so.""He said he was happy to have that written into any agreement as a legal guarantee.Mr Varadkar held a special meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss the text with his cabinet.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said ""the big problem"" would be getting the draft deal ""through parliament"". ""The only people who are precipitating the break-up of the United Kingdom are the DUP,"" he added.""It (the union) isn't under threat and I think talking that up has created a threat in itself,"" he said.Ulster Unionist Leader Robin Swann said it was ""absolutely crucial that we have had time to analyse all the documentation"".""If the words in the draft withdrawal agreement confirm the speculation, this has been a monumental error of judgement on behalf of the DUP which will have a devastating long-term impact,"" he said.Alliance deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said people needed ""to be incredibly responsible"".""Dramatising this as a constitutional question is extremely worrying and dangerous and indeed irresponsible and it's not just the DUP who are doing it, you have people like Boris Johnson last night doing it, talking about Dublin control,"" he said.Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens, who all campaigned to remain in the EU, are now expected to meet Mr Varadkar in Dublin on Thursday.Both the UK and EU are committed to ensuring physical checks at the Irish border will not be reintroduced.But if a solution cannot be found as part of a wider deal, the EU insisted on a legally binding ""backstop"".Until Tuesday, EU and UK negotiators had each come up with their own proposals for the Northern Ireland backstop, but had been unable to agree on a way forward.Focus remains on Downing Street where Theresa May is holding a special meeting of her cabinet to set out the details of the proposed text."

Emerging from a five-hour cabinet meeting, he said the alternative of a no-deal would be ""appalling"" for Scotland.He said he was clear the UK would leave the Common Fisheries Policy in 2020.Earlier he was among 13 Scottish Tory MPs who wrote to the prime minister seeking assurances on fishing. After a much longer than expected meeting, Theresa May's cabinet collectively backed the withdrawal agreement, and the 585-page document has now been published along with a shorter document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described it as ""bad deal"" for Scotland and predicted she would struggle to get it passed in the House of Commons.Mr Mundell told the BBC there had been a ""full and frank"" discussion at cabinet and they had agreed to move to the ""next stage"".He said there would be a special EU council meeting, hopefully later this month, and the cabinet would then decide if to recommend the deal to parliament.Asked about rumours of a leadership challenge to Mrs May, he urged fellow Conservatives to back the prime minister.He said: ""We need to support her going forward with the agreement, that's potentially been reached because the alternative to reaching this agreement is no deal, and no deal is an absolutely appalling outcome, not just for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom.""The earlier letter to Theresa May from Scottish Conservative MPs came amid speculation that the UK's departure from the Common Fisheries Polices (CFP) could be delayed or watered down.The CFP is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020. The letter reminded the prime minister she had promised this would happen and that anything less than this would be a ""betrayal of Scotland"". It went on to say: ""This has raised expectations in the fishing industry that Brexit will lead to complete control and full sovereignty over domestic waters that we must deliver on.""In order to deliver on these expectations, we could not support an agreement with the EU that would prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares.""That would mean that we would not be leaving the CFP in practice, and would become an independent coastal state in name only"".Following publication of the draft agreement the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) said it was seeking assurances that EU vessels will not be guaranteed continued access to UK waters in return for favourable trade terms.On Wednesday evening the EU negotiator Michel Barnier said: ""An essential condition for the single customs territory to cover fisheries... will be to agree between the Union and the UK on access to waters and fishing opportunities.""The declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU makes clear that a new fisheries agreement will need to be negotiated.SFF president Bertie Armstrong said: ""Any linkage between access and trade contravenes all international norms and practice and is simply unacceptable in principle."" Mr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is on maternity leave, have previously written to Mrs May warning they would not support any deal that gave Northern Ireland a different arrangement to the rest of the UK on the single market and customs union.They fear that making a special case for Northern Ireland while rejecting calls to do the same for Scotland would be a political gift to the SNP, and could fuel the case for independence.Asked about Northern Ireland, Mr Mundell said they continued to have concerns.He said: ""We want to ensure that Northern Ireland remains fully part of our United Kingdom. ""We've always been very clear about that and we want to be satisfied that those arrangements in place for Northern Ireland that also respect the Good Friday Agreement and existing all-Ireland arrangements don't do anything to undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom."""

The Institute of Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said it had no role in the unfair dismissal of Shahmir Sanni by the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA). Mr Sanni was unlawfully sacked by the TPA after taking his concerns about Vote Leave's spending to the Electoral Commission and the media.He had volunteered for the official Brexit campaign during the referendum - but told an employment tribunal the TPA fired him after being ""materially influenced"" by eight other pro-Brexit bodies. The TPA conceded the case before a full hearing was necessary. It now faces paying out substantial damages. Part of Mr Sanni's case was that the TPA was part of a nine-strong group of pro-Brexit campaigning organisations and think tanks - and that his actions were allegedly discussed at their regular joint meeting. TaxPayers Alliance admits unlawful whistleblower dismissalVote Leave broke spending limits, activist claimsVote Leave: Activist to give evidence of 'rule breaking'But in a statement to the BBC, one of those groups, the IEA, denied its staff were party to any discussion about Mr Sanni. ""The IEA as a corporate entity, as well as its staff members, have not discussed Mr Sanni's decision to take his evidence to the Electoral Commission and the media,"" said its associate director Kate Andrews.""The IEA can only speak to our corporate position and our staff's remarks made in a formal capacity as IEA representatives. It is not possible, or appropriate, for the IEA to comment on what our staff say in a personal capacity.""Ms Andrews said that IEA staff had not been involved in any discussions over Mr Sanni's actions with the eight other organisations named in his employment tribunal papers. ""The IEA's director general has held an internal audit, asking all current IEA staff members to supply him with an overview of any interactions the staff member had with Mr Sanni, and if anything had been said about him in a formal capacity. ""Twenty-four staff members have either never heard of Mr Sanni or have never knowingly had any interaction with him; none have ever made a public comment about him. Five staff members have met Mr Sanni, but have never publicly commented on him.""One member of IEA staff, Darren Grimes, was the founder of ""BeLeave"", the pro-Brexit group at the centre of Mr Sanni's allegations of funding wrongdoing. The Electoral Commission has fined Mr Grimes £20,000 and referred his conduct to the Metropolitan Police. He denies wrongdoing. The IEA said that any comments from the one member of staff who had met Mr Sanni and publicly commented on him were in a personal capacity. Following the TPA's admission of unlawfully sacking Mr Sanni, the chairman of the regular meetings between the nine pro-Brexit organisations said that the forum had been misrepresented. The IEA said that it too did not recognise the account of the meetings as a forum for political campaigning. "

Several former ministers - including Boris Johnson, Iain Duncan Smith and Justine Greening - tabled amendments designed to force the government to make the change from April.Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said: ""The government has listened and will now implement the reduction in April 2019.""Mr Wright added that a planned increase in Remote Gaming Duty, paid by online gaming firms, would be brought forward to April to cover the negative impact on the public finances.Ms Crouch said she welcomed the decision and was pleased that ""common sense"" had prevailed.Asked if she would like to return to Government, Ms Crouch said: ""There isn't a vacancy. That's been filled. So, I will just get on and do what I'm going to do.""The government had earlier said it had consulted widely and considered ""all of the evidence"" before making its decision on a timeframe.Theresa May had earlier been asked at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday about the timing by Conservative ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith.He said: ""I was enormously proud of my government for agreeing to lower the stake on fixed-odds betting terminals to £2 because they have caused endless harm, terrible damage to families and it was the right decision.""Since then, there has been a hiatus about the date at which this would start.""Mrs May answered: ""I recognise the strength of feeling on this issue. I know gambling addiction can devastate lives.""By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality CheckFOBTs were introduced into betting shops in 1999. Since then, the number has grown to 33,468 in Great Britain.Data from the Gambling Commission shows that the profit generated by FOBTs grew from £1.05bn in 2009 to £1.83bn last year - that's a rise of 74%.Last year, betting shops made £3.2bn from a combination of FOBTs and traditional ""over-the-counter"" bets. As a proportion of profits, FOBTs made up 57% of the total - up from 38% in 2008-09. That suggests that bookies are becoming increasingly reliant on them as a source of profit.FOBTs have been under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm. The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems.The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players.Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms have climbed, with Ladbrokes Coral-owner GVC Holdings 8% higher and William Hill shares up 2.23%.After the government brought forward the FOBT deadline, it meant GVC Holdings was spared a major cash payment to former Ladbrokes shareholders, analysts said.Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said it had taken ""the resignation of a good minister and a cross party revolt to achieve the blindingly obvious and necessary reforms to fixed-odds betting terminals"".He added it was ""a very good day for the many thousands of people whose families and communities are blighted by gambling addiction""."

2018-11-14,Chief Commons clerk retires,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115033109/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46211504,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEight months after our initial report into bullying and harassment, the clerk of the House of Commons has announced he will stand down. Sir David Natzler was expected to retire soon anyway; he is not being forced out. But his is the first - and, so far, only - departure from the House of Commons of any of the principals involved in the issue.Sir David, as clerk of the House, is the top clerk. One of the first things anyone says about Sir David is that he is clever. But, in recent months, that description has been larded with caveats; notably words like ""unworldly"". The go-to man when it comes to understanding parliamentary procedure, but no manager. Someone who failed to see the problem before him - either before our investigation or after.Sir David is blamed for blundering in the first few days after our initial report was published. The House's action in the first 24 hours seriously damaged his capacity to lead the House of Commons Service. The House's initial response was to suggest that all the problems were historical, and to pick on one serving clerk's testimony - that she lived in a ""climate of fear"" - as a ""grotesque exaggeration"". By the next week, Sir David had to change course. He wrote to staff, explaining: ""Some of you have expressed to me and to others your dismay at the tone of our statement to Newsnight and the subsequent email we sent to you on Friday morning. I acknowledge we got it wrong in giving the impression we were in denial.""But the damage was done. The Cox Review, written by Dame Laura Cox, a former judge, found that the initial statement: ""in both content and tone, was wholly out of kilter with the strength of feeling of many members of staff, and with the findings of the Working Group just a few weeks previously. And the contributions to this inquiry reveal that it has caused enduring anger and distress."" In the months since, Sir David has sought to repent and reassure clerks about his seriousness of purpose. But a large number of clerks have not regained their trust in him. He put his name to a tortuous piece of argument which claimed that the House of Commons did not issue non-disclosure agreements to departing staff; on any reasonable reading of what happened, that was untrue. That is how we arrived here. The House promised to fix the problems Newsnight identified. But, as Dame Laura put it: ""the level of trust and confidence in the senior House administration to deliver on that promise is now so low that few contributors to this inquiry consider it likely to happen, at least not within the foreseeable future."" Today, John Bercow, the speaker, tried to dismiss any notion that this departure was linked to bullying, saying: ""I have known this day was coming for over a year"". But Sir David's retirement in March may be a precondition of restoring trust.Replacing him will need to be done with care. The problem of bullying and harassment runs deep into the upper layers of the House of Commons. The current senior management have known of this problem for years. In some cases, they have been perpetrators themselves. Others have been victims - and used their experience to justify advising others to stay silent and not complain. When Sir David was appointed, the House had been looking at bringing in an outsider. The Cox report implicitly makes a strong case for considering such a move. A lot of senior clerks will see this as an appalling idea; a common view among likely candidates for the succession is that Dame Laura did not understand the ""political realities"" of the House. But those political realities are the support beams for what Dame Laura called ""a corrosive culture, in which bullying and harassment, in particular of women, have become normalised and which cascades down through the structures. This misconduct involves not only relations between MPs and House staff, but between senior and junior House staff and between House staff working at the same level.""""As some members of staff see that other staff and MPs can bully people and not be held to account, they feel able to bully others in turn, without fear of adverse consequences, or feel that this is the best way to achieve results, and the problem soon becomes embedded. Bullying becomes legitimised and complaining about it is regarded as ""likely to make matters worse,"" or as ""career suicide."""" Appointing someone to replace him who has no experience of a functional workplace would, at this juncture, be a bolder call than appointing someone who needs to read up on procedure.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

I have lots of memories of being kicked under a science lab table until my shins bled.""""I was punched in the face, I was kicked down several flights of stairs when I was in school, that became quite a regular part of being there.""At one point Mr Elmore was ordered by the bullies to stay on a rugby pitch while the bullies stood by and, afraid to leave until they said he could, he stayed there for hours. By this point he had soiled himself and was petrified.""They thought it was hilarious,"" said Mr Elmore, MP for Ogmore. ""They had achieved their goal because I was simply too terrified to leave the pitch. I can remember walking home and then trying to wash my clothes myself so I didn't have to show my parents. ""So things like that you can't just say, well forget about that and forget it ever happened. That was the weekend, then I had to go back to school with them on Monday morning and just pretend like nothing had gone on.""He added: ""Life is complicated enough when you're a teenager you're going through lots of change and you're trying to figure out who you are as a person, and when you add bullying to the mix that makes it even more difficult. ""You feel someone could control you to such a point that you are too frightened to do anything which makes you low and isolated.""When he spoke about his experiences in an impassioned speech in the House of Commons last year it hit a nerve. He has since been asked to become chairman of an All-Party Parliamentary group on young people's mental health and social media.""The digital world is a whole new level of bullying because you can transfer it into what you are consuming and there is no real escape from it,"" said Mr Elmore. ""It does intensify the level of bullying and can also lead to larger scale bullying because people will see you as being weaker and they can target you via social media so there is a more intensive experience of bullying.""He experienced this himself when one of his former bullies posted on social media making light of what had happened in their school days.""One of them made a joke of it on my Facebook,"" said Mr Elmore. ""But he was called out on it by friends and constituents. If they haven't moved on from it then that is up to them. For me coming through what happened has made me a better person.""Mr Elmore hopes the group will be able to help people like Connor Strange, 23, who was intensely bullied on social media.""I got some really offensive messages telling me to go kill myself, telling me I was worthless, telling me I wasn't good enough,"" said Mr Strange. ""I felt really demoralised, I felt like a human shell, I didn't feel like myself anymore.""""Social media can affect your mental health really badly and can have ultimate consequences at the end of the day if you get really bad comments.""Mr Strange was subsequently diagnosed with depression, anxiety and emotionally unstable personality disorder.Mr Elmore said he hopes the new group will help bring cases like Mr Strange's to the government's attention.He said: ""Even now all these years later, if I bumped into one of those who bullied me I know that I would freeze and it would be a very difficult situation for me to deal with mentally.""I hope the government realise that there is a problem and they need to respond to it."""
2018-11-14,Brexit deal bad for Scotland - Sturgeon,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115033109/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46207184,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNicola Sturgeon has claimed that the draft Brexit agreement between the UK and EU would be bad for Scotland as her party pledged to oppose the deal. Scotland's first minister said the proposals would take Scotland out of the single market while Northern Ireland in effect stays in.This would have a ""devastating"" impact on jobs and investment in Scotland, she insisted. Mrs May has won cabinet backing for the deal after a five-hour meeting.But her Brexit deal proposals, which have now been published, are facing strong opposition from senior Brexiteers and some Remain supporters.Theresa May said there had been a ""long, detailed and impassioned debate"" by cabinet members on the draft agreement.Speaking outside Number 10, she said: ""I firmly believe that the draft withdrawal agreement was the best that could be negotiated and it was for the cabinet to decide whether to move on in the talks.""But Ms Sturgeon said it was obvious that the prime minister could ""barely unite her cabinet on this deal"" and that she would struggle to get a majority for it in the House of Commons.""In these circumstances it is more important than ever that we are not faced with a false choice between a bad deal and no deal,"" she said. ""No one should be effectively blackmailed into a choice between the frying pan or the fire. ""This proposed deal would be a bad one for Scotland, taking us out of a single market eight times the size of the UK market alone and posing a huge threat to jobs, investment and living standards. ""If this deal is indeed rejected by Parliament then the UK government must return to the negotiating table to secure a better one. ""Our bottom line - short of continued EU membership - is continued, permanent membership of the single market and customs union.""  Ms Sturgeon later tweeted that she had received a phone call from Mrs May and had pointed out that the draft document makes no mention of Scotland. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's minority Conservative government, has warned that the deal could lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom if it is accepted by MPs. The major sticking point in the negotiations between the UK and EU has been over the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", which aims to guarantee that physical checks will not be reintroduced at the border with the Irish Republic if the EU and UK fail to agree a deal on future trading relations.The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said the draft agreement involved Northern Ireland staying aligned to the EU single market rules that are ""essential for the avoidance of a hard border"". Sources told the BBC last month that Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is currently on maternity leave after the birth of her son, and Scottish Secretary David Mundell could quit their roles if a Brexit deal introduced different arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mr Mundell, who denied at the time that he had threatened to quit, said after Wednesday's cabinet meeting he was content to move on to the next stage on the basis that ""arrangements for Northern Ireland will not undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK"".Before Wednesday's cabinet meeting started, a letter from Mr Mundell and other Scottish Tory MPs was hand delivered to No 10 warning against any backsliding on fishing rights for the UK after Brexit. Please upgrade your browserThe SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has already confirmed that his party's 35 MPs would oppose the Brexit agreement in its current form. But Ms Sturgeon, the SNP leader, said rejecting the current proposals in the House of Commons would not make a no-deal Brexit inevitable. Instead, she insisted it would open the possibility for getting ""better options like full single market and customs union membership back on the table"".And she said it would also allow those arguing for another referendum to be held on the Brexit terms - including the SNP - to make their case. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must be striving for what is right for the country and my job is to strive for what is right for Scotland, not accepting bad deals.""It is ironic is it not that the last two years the prime minister has told us no deal is better than a bad deal, and now she is arguing that we have got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal. That is a false choice.""Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Golden said the UK government and EU had negotiated a plan to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.He added: ""This shouldn't be about creating a new border between us and England.""Nicola Sturgeon has spent months talking up the merits of the EU single market. She needs to explain why it is in Scotland's interests to fracture the UK internal market, as she seems to want to do.On Tuesday, Mr Blackford joined Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem Sir Vince Cable and Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts in writing to the prime minister to seek assurances that MPs would be given a ""meaningful vote"" on the Brexit agreement.This would mean that amendments to be proposals can be tabled and voted on.Their joint letter stated: ""Recent interventions from government ministers have suggested that you and your government may seek to limit or constrain the process on the final vote, in an attempt to muzzle parliament.""We want to be clear that this would be wholly unacceptable."""

Ms Onasanya, 35, denies one count of perverting the course of justice.Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said the MP and her brother Festus Onasanya had ""acted jointly in telling lies"".The court was told Ms Onasanya, who is the MP for Peterborough, was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) after her car was clocked by a speed camera in Thorney, near Peterborough, on 24 July last year.She returned the paperwork naming Aleks Antipow as the driver, jurors heard.Mr Jeremy said Mr Antipow was the previous tenant of a property that Ms Onasanya and her brother had rented in Cambridge.The court heard that Mr Antipow was at home in Russia at the time of the incident and had never driven the MP's car.Mr Jeremy said that providing a real name but false address and telephone number meant Mr Antipow ""would remain untraceable"", so that ""the true driver of Miss Onasanya's car would escape prosecution"".The court was told the MP's brother, Festus Onasanya, had also ""deployed the tactic"" when his car was caught by a speed camera on two occasions last year.Mr Jeremy accused Ms Onasanya, who is a solicitor, of ""adopting her brother's method of evading prosecution"".""The two of them were acting jointly in telling lies in order to prevent the prosecution of the true driver,"" he said.Mr Jeremy told jurors that Ms Onasanya was a busy person but had ""trapped"" herself in lies by adopting her brother's methods of making a speeding prosecution disappear.He said: ""This case may have started as a case about an offence of speeding.""It has become, as a result of the choices made by Miss Onasanya, a case about lying.  ""Lying persistently and deliberately. Lying all the way to this court, maybe about lying in this court.""On 5 November, Mr Onasanya, 33, of Chesterton, Cambridge, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to three counts of perverting the course of justice.Mr Jeremy told jurors: ""The question for you to decide in this case will be whether Festus Onasanya was acting alone or whether the two of them were acting together.""Mr Onasanya has been bailed until the end of his sister's trial, when he will be sentenced.The trial continues."

It's not about any permanent future relationship.It's a long read - 585 pages long - and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise?Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least £39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. And then there's the legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document).The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The Draft Agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it?If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK.The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"".Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market.One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"".There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (referred to in the text as the Protocol on Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage.The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK.""So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised.Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

They are: a pre-Christmas deal with the EU, or an admission that a deal is not possible.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Today programme on Monday that in this scenario Parliament would take over. Downing Street has a ready response to that idea: only the government has executive powers to negotiate, so Parliament has limited influence.But parliamentarians on all sides have been holding talks among themselves and with Commons officials over the last year, working out just what Parliament could do in the event that MPs reject every option on the table: deal and no deal.John Bercow, the speaker, has been consulted by senior parliamentarians. He has been told that around this time in the Brexit calendar he may well find that the executive is so ""enfeebled"" that Parliament may have to take over.I am told that the speaker has listened with great care to MPs but has been careful not to reveal his hand. Senior Commons officials have suggested that unless Parliament is able to amend legislation then the ability of MPs to shape Brexit will be limited. This explains why the government is so keen that its ""meaningful"" vote should be held on a non-amendable, take-it-or-leave-it basis.Senior pro-European MPs are hoping that the speaker will break with convention and allow MPs to hold votes with bite. Tory and Labour MPs have been looking at the way in which the Labour frontbench has successfully forced the government's hand in recent months - requiring ministers to publish government documents - through a parliamentary device which petitions the Queen.Brexiteers in cabinet view the speaker with great suspicion and believe he is biding his time to help Remainers in the Commons. It should not be forgotten, however, that the speaker's diminishing set of friends on the Tory side include Brexit supporters. They also have his ear.The greatest hopes among MPs hoping that Parliament may take over rest not in the arcane world of Commons rules and procedures, but in the simple belief that no government can function without the support of Parliament. Many MPs have cast aside Erskine May, the bible of Parliamentary procedure, and have instead chosen to look to history for inspiration. Their book of choice is Six Minutes in May which describes how Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain in May 1940 after the debacle of the Norway campaign. A vote on the most neutral motion of all - whether to adjourn the Commons - was held. Chamberlain won. But the catastrophic loss of support on his benches and elsewhere spelled the end. The Six Minutes, as Jim Naughtie wrote in the New Statesman, refers to the length of the Commons voting division measured by an egg timer on the clerks' table.In May 1940 it was soon clear what should happen. The person from the largest party who could command the greatest support across Parliament - even though he had been at the heart of planning the Norway operation - succeeded Chamberlain. Churchill became prime minister.Even though Boris Johnson likes to think of himself as a 21st century Churchill there is no such figure on the horizon. We can expect lots more fog before another moment of clarity arrives."

Jean Winder became a trailblazer in January 1944, as the first woman to become a permanent Hansard reporter - accurately and promptly reporting the proceedings of Parliament and its committees.Wartime labour shortages had forced a change in recruitment practice and Hansard editor at the time, Percy Cole, said ""the only reason why I thought of appointing a woman was that I was unable to find a man"".During his time as prime minister, Winston Churchill said Mrs Winder was ""a shorthand writer's dream"", and Mr Cole described her as ""as good as the men"", noting that she was commended for her work more than any other member of staff. Records suggest that on one occasion, Mrs Winder reported on a committee at 10:30 through until the House of Commons adjourned at 02:30 the next day, having to sleep in the House.Mrs Winder was also a determined and ultimately successful campaigner for equal pay. She sought justice in 1951 after finding her salary was £250 a year less than some of her male counterparts, and wrote directly to the then Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to ask the reason.It is believed her call for equal pay was encouraged by Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir's amendment to the Education Bill in 1944 in support of equal pay for teachers.The amendment initially passed with a majority of only one vote, and was the wartime coalition's only defeat.Mr Gaitskell's response to her dodged the question, stating ""practically every department has grades where women receive the same rates of pay as men"".He added ""this is quite different from the statement that in every government department, where women perform the same work as men, they receive the same salary"".Her call for equal pay came at a time, after World War Two, when this was a hot topic because women had undertaken work vital to the war effort.Her pay claim was supported by Mr Cole and the Speaker of the House, Douglas Clifton-Brown, but calls for her to receive the same pay as her male counterparts became more prominent after female Conservative MP Irene Ward took up her case.Ms Ward pursued it with unflagging energy. On 2 August 1951 she stood up in the Commons to inform fellow MPs of the situation, stating that Parliament ""cannot be run on the basis of equal pay"" if one woman on the Hansard staff was not paid an equal wage.In 1953, Ms Ward told the Speaker: ""I shall hand in a motion mentioning Mrs Winder, and shall follow up my motion by a letter to The Times or the Spectator and put the Treasury on the spot.""In January 1954, Mrs Winder finally received the same salary as her male colleagues, and it was agreed her pay would rise along with theirs in future.Mrs Winder paved the way towards the 50:50 gender ratio split in the Hansard team today and, in 2005, Commons Hansard appointed its first female editor, Lorraine Sutherland. From Monday 12 November, the House of Commons library will host a month-long exhibition to commemorate the life and achievements of Mrs Winder, who died in 2005, aged 96.Hansard sub-editor Portia Dadley, who organised the exhibition, said ""she was a woman who would not take no for an answer"".""As we mark Equal Pay Day 2018 - and as one of Mrs Winder's female successors in the Hansard team - I am delighted to be organising this exhibition to commemorate someone who made the words 'equal pay for equal work' a reality,"" she said.

Mr Juncker's successor will enjoy a massive profile, a seat at summits of EU leaders and the power to introduce - if not pass - new European laws.  The European People's Party (EPP) includes the heads of government of eight EU countries including Germany, Austria, Ireland, and Hungary. And because the group currently dominates the European Parliament, whoever wins this contest will have the most political clout in the race.Two men are in the running: the EPP's leader in the European Parliament, Manfred Weber, and former Finnish Prime Minister Alexander Stubb. Conveniently, both have made videos that sum up their candidacies better than any policy pamphlet. In his glossy production, Manfred Weber goes back to his home town in Bavaria - the heartland of his party, the CSU.I am from a small town in lower Bavaria, like many other villages and towns in Europe. Here and everywhere else people are asking us to bring Europe back home. Watch my video for #EPPHelsinki here! #StrongerTogether #BetterEurope pic.twitter.com/0tCKIBvcFFEnd of Twitter post  by @ManfredWeberHe talks about security and the need to protect the ""European way of life"" - one embodied by old buildings, scenic vistas and an all-white group of fifty-something political allies meeting in a wood-panelled restaurant.    Mr Stubb's effort is a compilation of pictures of him with young fans, being interviewed on the red carpets of the EU institutions, backed by Finland's version of Mumford and Sons. Good evening folks. The @EPP asked us to do a two minute introductory video. Thanks for the music to Samu Haber and my friends at @SunriseAveBand. Thanks to my mate @Ekapekka for the production. Hope it puts you all in a good mood for the evening. #RT appreciated. pic.twitter.com/W8f7DqpcFAEnd of Twitter post  by @alexstubbHis motto is ""Next Generation Europe"" - presumably a generation that should be led by someone with a 14-year career featuring stints as a member of the European Parliament, head of government and vice-president of the European Investment Bank, and who is actually four years older than his rival.  Their campaigning styles have been different too.  Manfred Weber has secured endorsements from people in high places, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.  Alexander Stubb hands out leaflets from his 10-year old Opel Astra car and holds ""pop-up press conferences"" at the airport with an army of young volunteers. Absent from the race is an EPP lifer with a sky-high profile.  It's the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who ruled himself out because he has his hands full with the on-going talks.  And there's a chance the job won't go to Mr Weber or Mr Stubb either.  Or the centre-left equivalent, Frans Timmermans, who is currently first vice-president of the Commission. Or the Greens' candidate when they select one. The Liberal group isn't fielding anyone.And that's because the system has changed since the last vacancy for European Commission president in 2014.  The Lisbon Treaty says that the appointment should reflect the results of the European Parliament elections.  Previously the Parliament interpreted that as meaning the role should go to the lead candidate - or spitzenkandidat - of the political group that won the most seats in the European elections.  Hence Jean-Claude Juncker's selection, despite objections from then British Prime Minister David Cameron.  Spitzenkandidat 2.0 is different.  The European Parliament has agreed that it will endorse the person who commands a majority in a vote of MEPs when they return after May's elections.  The final decision is then made by EU leaders.  They have agreed that they will not automatically appoint the Parliament's choice or necessarily someone who even stood as a spitzenkandidat in the first place.  It could lead to a massive row or the job could go to someone else who is widely respected, has cultivated MEPs and happens to be available in the second half of the year. ""How about… Michel Barnier?!"" goes the theory in Brussels. He has said that he is dedicated to his current job. However, he wasn't too busy to deliver an 80-minute speech about the future of Europe to the EU elite on Monday night.  And there's another Brexit angle.Whoever gets the job will oversee the finalisation of the UK/EU trade deal and will set the tone for the new relationship between the two for decades to come.  So this could be the start of a beautiful friendship, whether it is Michel, Manfred, Alex or Frans, or anyone else.Listen to Adam on Brexitcast on BBC Sounds"

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...The UK and EU have provisionally agreed on the three ""divorce"" issues of how much money the UK owes the EU, what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. Talks are now focusing on the detail of how to avoid having a physical Northern Ireland border - and on future relations. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet has agreed how it sees those future relations working - but this plan, often called the Chequers Plan because it was agreed at the PM's country residence, has faced criticism from anti-Brexit campaigners and also some leading pro-Brexit Conservatives. And also from the EU - which has said key parts won't work.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Negotiations about future relations between the UK and the EU are taking place now. Both sides hope they can agree by mid-November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May delivered a big speech setting out her thoughts on the UK and EU's future relations on 2 March, 2018 and then followed that up in July with the Chequers Plan - the UK's official offer to the EU on how Brexit should work.Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution is to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends.But the EU says a backstop would not work if it is time-limited. Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

They are looking to the Conservative Party to deliver."" Asked if she would carry on as prime minister if she won a no-confidence vote by a single vote, Mrs May said: ""Leadership is about taking the right decisions, not the easy ones.""She said her job was to ""bring back a deal that delivers on the vote of the British people"".She added: ""I believe this is a deal which does deliver that, which is in the national interest and am I going to see this through? Yes."" The prime minister, a cricket fan, was asked if she would ""resign as captain"", but told journalists Geoffrey Boycott, famed for his batting marathons, was one of her sporting heroes: ""And what do you know about Geoffrey Boycott? Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end.""Amid suggestions she was struggling to fill the two cabinet posts vacated by Dominic Raab and Esther McVey earlier on Thursday, she joked: ""I have had, actually, rather a busy day.""The BBC understands that Environment Secretary Michael Gove had been offered the job as Brexit Secretary but had asked for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal.Mrs May said Mr Gove was doing ""an excellent job at Defra"" adding: ""I haven't appointed a new Dexeu [Department for Exiting the European Union] secretary yet and I will be making appointments to the government in due course.""By BBC Political Editor Laura KuenssbergThe government, for today at least, is at the mercy of events not in control.Theresa May's vow to stay does not make her deep, deep problems disappear.With her party in revolt, her colleagues departing - some determined to usher her out of office - we can't, and don't know yet, if Brexit can happen as planned, perhaps, if at all.This could be a gale that's weathered in a few days, or a serious storm that sweeps the government away.Read Laura's blogMeanwhile German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement: ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further.""Despite a warning from Tory backbencher Mark Francois earlier that it would be ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons"", Mrs May said she believed, ultimately, her MPs would back it.""I'm committed, as prime minister, to bringing the best deal back to the UK. I think MPs across my party who look at that deal will recognise the importance of delivering on the vote of the British people and recognise the importance of doing that in a way that does protect people's jobs, protect security and protect the unity of our United Kingdom.""But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable suggested the prime minister was ""in denial"": ""The facts haven't changed. There is no majority in Parliament for her deal, and she has rightly conceded that ""No Brexit"" is the real alternative to it.""He said it strengthened the case for another referendum ""to break the deadlock and get the country out of this mess"".Earlier Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the deal negotiated with the EU as ""half-baked"" and urged her to withdraw it. He told MPs: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal.""But Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley defended the prime minister, saying ""there is no better person to do this job"".She said collective responsibility meant that ministers who could not support the deal were required to resign, but added: ""The majority of the cabinet is behind it. The remaining members of the cabinet are absolutely behind this deal and what we need to do now is get behind the prime minister and get that deal sorted in the November (European) Council."""
2018-11-15,"No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn",https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46228454,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU leaders have dismissed talk of renegotiating the draft Brexit deal and warned the UK's political situation could make a ""no-deal"" more likely.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was ""no question"" of reopening talks as a document was ""on the table"". Meanwhile French PM Edouard Philippe said there was a need to prepare for a no-deal because of UK ""uncertainty"".The EU has set out a series of meetings leading up to 25 November when it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.However leaders admit that there is still much ground to cover after the UK Prime Minister Theresa May won backing on Wednesday from her cabinet for the 585-page draft agreement. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said.On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said she was pleased that progress had been made. But following news of resignations from Mrs May's cabinet, including the UK's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, she said it was possible that Britain may still leave without a deal.She also said that there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement. ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further,"" she said. Mr Philippe appeared to echo her sentiment over UK political uncertainty. ""It will escape no-one that the current political situation in Britain could fuel uncertainty... over the ratification of the accord,"" he said. The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"".French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules.Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya AdlerThe EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time.I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"".Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"" and ""optimistic"", adding: ""We are pinning our hopes on it.""Speaking on Thursday alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk, Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"".Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"".He laid out the timetable for the days ahead.Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.""Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us.""Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019.If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict."

Her cabinet backed it on Wednesday - but there have since been resignations.Two cabinet ministers, and two junior ministers, have resigned over the deal - while some Conservative MPs have attempted to force a leadership contest by writing letters of no confidence in the prime minister. What happens now?The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. Mrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, on Wednesday evening. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.The deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states. A draft agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. It is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.Alongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is a five-page ""political declaration"" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like. This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.The political declaration envisages ""a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".There would be ""ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.The two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop.This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.The role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.Mrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.They could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.Dominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary on Thursday morning, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"". Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department.Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it ""leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation"".On Thursday afternoon, Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.An emergency EU summit will be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.After that, Mrs May faces the fight of her life to get MPs to vote for it - something the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said could take place around 7 December.Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs have also said they will vote against it.If Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.Some Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out.On Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was ""no question"" of reopening talks. Mrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, ""nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow"" and it would mean taking ""a path of deep and grave uncertainty"".

2018-11-15,Raab quits over 'flawed' Brexit agreement,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46219495,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab says he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft Brexit agreement with the EU.And he told the BBC the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"".Another cabinet minister, Esther McVey, also quit alongside junior ministers Suella Braverman and Shailesh Vara.PM Theresa May faced nearly three hours of largely hostile questions in the Commons and could potentially face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs.BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a source had told her Michael Gove has been offered the job of Brexit Secretary and he was understood to be considering it, but to be asking for assurances that he could pursue a different kind of deal. Leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has submitted a letter of no confidence in her to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee. A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham. It is understood 48 letters have not yet been received.Mr Rees-Mogg told reporters that the negotiations had ""given way on all the key points"" adding: ""The deal risks Brexit because it is not a proper Brexit."" He denied being involved in a coup against the PM, saying he was ""working through the procedures of the Conservative Party"" which was ""entirely constitutional"". Mr Rees-Mogg said he did not have any leadership ambitions of his own but listed Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey and Penny Mordaunt as among those who would be ""very capable of leading a proper Brexit"".Downing Street said Mrs May would fight any no-confidence vote.Asked by Labour MP Mike Gapes if it was time she ""stood aside for someone else who could take this country forward in a united way"", Mrs May replied: ""No.""Chief whip Julian Smith said the prime minister ""will not be bullied"" into changing course.And Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan described Mr Rees-Mogg's comments as ""deeply destructive"" and warned Conservative MPs: ""If this government is undermined further, we could destroy the government, we could significantly damage and even destroy the Conservative Party, all of which would be happening in the middle of an unconcluded set of Brexit negotiations."" He added: ""We have a massive responsibility to exercise our judgement in a climate of what has to be compromise.""The day after Theresa May announced that she had secured the backing of her cabinet for the withdrawal agreement, she told MPs it was not a final agreement, but brought the UK ""close to a Brexit deal"".But she was met with laughter and shouts of ""resign"" as she said it would allow the UK to leave the EU ""in a smooth and orderly way"" on 29 MarchThe prime minister told MPs the agreement would deliver the Brexit people voted for and allow the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"".But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This is not the deal the country was promised and Parliament cannot - and I believe will not - accept a false choice between this bad deal and no deal.""Dominic Raab - a Leave supporter promoted to the cabinet to replace David Davis who quit in protest at Mrs May's Brexit plans in July - is the most high-profile minister to quit the government.He was closely involved in drafting the 585-page document, which sets out the terms of Britain's departure from the EU. He told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""I've been fighting for a good Brexit deal but the terms proposed to the cabinet yesterday [Wednesday], I think, had two major and fatal flaws.""The first is that the terms being offered by the EU threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom and the second is that they would lead to an indefinite if not permanent situation where we're locked into a regime with no say over the rules being applied, with no exit mechanism. ""I think that would be damaging for the economy but devastating for public trust in our democracy.""He said Theresa May needed a Brexit secretary who ""will pursue the deal that she wants to put to the country with conviction"".""I don't feel I can do that in good conscience,"" he added.He said he held Mrs May in ""high esteem"" but said: ""I do think we need to change course on Brexit"".And he said the government should be willing to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of what he described as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister was her inevitable defeat in the Commons, he argued.Asked if he would put himself forward for leader, if the government falls apart, he did not rule it out but said it would be ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that now.In her resignation letter, Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey told Mrs May the agreement does not ""honour the result of the referendum, indeed it does not meet the tests you set from the outset of your premiership"".""We have gone from 'no deal is better than a bad deal' to any deal is better than no deal,"" she added.Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, has also quit, as has Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department.Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to resign over Mrs May's agreement on Thursday morning, saying, it ""leaves the UK in a halfway house with no time limit on when we will finally be a sovereign nation"". Brexit minister Suella Braverman also quit. And Rehman Chisti quit as vice chairman of the Conservative Party - partly over the withdrawal agreement. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""After two years of bungled negotiations, the government has produced a botched deal that breaches the prime minister's own red lines and does not meet our six tests.""The government is in chaos. Their deal risks leaving the country in an indefinite halfway house without a real say.""The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford said Mrs May was ""trying to sell us a deal that is already dead in the water"" and expressed outrage that Scotland was not mentioned once in the draft withdrawal agreement.But the controversial part relates to what will happen to the Irish border.The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.If there is no trade deal in place by the end of the transition period, the backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things such as food products and goods standards.It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.Brexiteers do not like the prospect of potentially being tied to EU customs rules for years or even, as some fear, indefinitely.And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea and they will not vote for the agreement.Setting out details of the arrangements for a possible ""backstop"", Mrs May said: ""I do not pretend that this has been a comfortable process, or that either we or the EU are entirely happy with some of the arrangements which have been included in it.""But she added that ""while some people might pretend otherwise, there is no deal which delivers the Brexit the British people voted for which does not involve this insurance policy"".She insisted it was a last resort and would be time-limited.Please upgrade your browserMuch will depend on whether Mrs May faces a vote of no-confidence in her leadership. If she does, all bets are off. If not, European Council President Donald Tusk has announced an emergency meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on 25 November, at which the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations would be finalised and formalised.The BBC's Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the UK and the EU will have to agree an ultimate end date for the post-Brexit transition period by the end of next week. The transition period is due to end in 2020 and can be extended once by mutual agreement. The text of the draft withdrawal agreement currently says the end date is ""20XX"". A senior EU official said the negotiators will have to fill in a specific year by the 25 November summit.Ultimately any deal would be put to MPs. Tory backbencher Mark Francois told Mrs May earlier that with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and scores of Tory MPs planning to vote against it, it is ""mathematically impossible to get this deal through the House of Commons""."

2018-11-15,Pound and UK shares hit by Brexit turmoil,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46219038,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe pound and shares in housebuilders and banks have fallen sharply after cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey quit over Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit deal.Royal Bank of Scotland sank 9%, with 7% falls for Persimmon, Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Developments.Sterling fell 1.7% against the dollar and 1.9% against the euro.The FTSE 100 index closed little moved, but the FTSE 250, which mainly comprises UK-focused firms, fell 1.6%.Capita topped the fallers in the FTSE 250, plunging 14%, with Countryside Properties down 9%.Shares in companies that do most or all of their business in the UK reflected the continued political uncertainty, as members of the Conservative Party and opposition politicians voiced their scepticism over the draft deal. ""The market has taken a big red pen to stocks which are heavily exposed to the UK economy like the banks, retailers and housebuilders,"" said Laith Khalaf at Hargreaves Lansdown.""These sectors were already under pressure, but the potential for an orderly Brexit to unravel in the next few days is causing further distress to be manifested in share prices.""BBC business editor Simon Jack said: ""The odds of a general election have just gone up and that means the possibility of a Corbyn government must have increased as well. ""Markets don't like the prospect of that because of Labour's intention to raise taxes on companies and nationalise large sections of the economy.""The higher chances of an election was one of the reasons behind RBS' steep fall, as the Labour Party has said it would nationalise the lender. However, shares in other banks also fell, as investors considered the threat to the economy and therefore to banks' balance sheets if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal.Sterling ended the day in London at under $1.28 against the dollar after a turbulent day's trading. Initially on Wednesday, when Theresa May announced she had secured cabinet backing for the draft Brexit agreement with Brussels, the pound recovered earlier lost ground. But by Thursday morning it was already wavering. A string of ministerial resignations led by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, undermined confidence in the pound further as market observers deemed the chances of a disorderly Brexit had risen.The Brexit process has been punctuated by big movements in the pound's relationship with the dollar, something which can lead to big gains or losses for investors.  In the run-up to, and immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum on 23 June 2016, for example, the pound hit a peak of volatility against the dollar. And as the graphic below shows, the events surrounding Wednesday's draft agreement has triggered the greatest volatility for sterling since the referendum. Jane Foley at Rabobank said the pound's plunge was ""firmly tied"" to the perception that Mrs May will have difficulty in pushing the Brexit plan through Parliament.  She said the resignations had increased speculation that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote, something that would weigh heavily on the pound: ""Any turn of events that could raise the risk of a general election would also punish the pound, given the risk of a market-unfriendly far-left government.""Chris Turner at ING said Mr Raab's resignation had increased the chances of a leadership challenge and a no-deal Brexit. He said the pound ""could fall another 3-4% unless the threat of a leadership election is quashed or there are clearer signs that the withdrawal agreement can garner more support in parliament"".  Organisations that speak on behalf of business like the Confederation of British Industry welcomed the draft deal, because it offered the prospect of a smooth path towards Brexit.The CBI described the agreement as a ""compromise, including for business"" but was happy that it represented a ""step back from the cliff-edge"".The agreement includes a 21-month transition period, during which time the UK will negotiate new trade terms with the EU. The UK would have a unilateral right to extend that transition period, which was described as ""very positive for business"" by James Stewart, head of Brexit at KPMG.Northern Ireland also has the guarantee of a ""friction-free"" customs border with the Republic of Ireland.CBI Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn told the BBC: ""There is a possible path to frictionless trade now in terms of negotiating the final deal. I don't think anyone thinks the transition or the backstop is the answer, so this has to be used as a route to a final deal with frictionless trade and access for services.""Of course not. Pro-Brexit economist Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at Netwealth Investment and former chief economic adviser to Boris Johnson while he was Mayor of London, says the draft withdrawal deal is not something to cheer about.""Whilst it has avoided the cliff edge, I think it's important we don't bury our heads in the sands here and view this as a 'good' deal - this is still disappointing,"" he said.Those who had hoped the draft deal would supply some reassurance will also be disappointed as Theresa May wrestles with critics and struggles to unite enough MPs behind her plan."

He put it to MPs: ""The choice is now clear, we stand up for the United Kingdom, the whole of the United Kingdom, the integrity of the United Kingdom or we vote for a vassal state with the break-up of the UK.""But the prime minister said it was wrong to imply that she had not considered the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.The real spat among politicians is over the UK and EU's agreement on the Northern Ireland backstop.It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, if another solution cannot be found by the end of the transition period in December 2020.That means that goods coming into Northern Ireland would need to be checked to see if they meet EU standards.It would also involve a temporary single custom territory effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary.Mrs May has said there was no deal on the table that did not involve signing up to the backstop - but that it is only an insurance policy.Labour MPs claim DUP MPs are supporting Corbyn's speech in the Commons this morning.

2018-11-15,Tory MP urges Mundell to quit over EU deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46220929,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Scottish secretary has been urged to quit by one of his own colleagues over the draft Brexit deal. In a WhatsApp message to David Mundell, Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson said ""no Unionist"" could support the proposals. Mr Thomson said he was asking Mr Mundell ""in the gentlest and strongest terms"" to follow Brexit secretary Dominic Raab in quitting the cabinet.Mr Mundell has told BBC Scotland he has no intention of standing down.He has publicly backed the draft agreement, saying he was doing so on the basis that a no-deal Brexit would be ""appalling"" for Scotland, and urged his fellow Conservative MPS to support the prime minister. Mr Mundell has also launched a broadside against the ministers who have resigned - including Mr Raab.He said: ""As someone who has stood steadfastly for keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom, I am not going to take lectures from latter-day Unionists who are now using it as merely a hook on which to hang their resignations.""The Union is far more important than people's political careers. That is why I am focused on Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom and the best way for that to happen is to ensure that we have an orderly Brexit across the whole of the United Kingdom.""Mr Raab's resignation, along with those of four others including Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara, is a major blow for the prime minister, who announced on Wednesday evening that her cabinet had agreed the 585-page EU withdrawal document. Mr Raab backed Leave in the Brexit referendum and was closely involved in drafting the agreement, which sets out the terms of Britain's departure from the EU. In his resignation letter, he said the deal represented a ""very real threat to the integrity of the United Kingdom"" because of special provisions for Northern Ireland.He also said he could not accept ""an indefinite backstop arrangement"" for the Irish border.Indeed! https://t.co/WpB5y7LlvHEnd of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonIn his WhatsApp message to Mr Mundell, which has been seen by BBC Scotland, Mr Thomson said the backstop arrangements ""mean a separate regulatory regime in Northern Ireland and that they will be more closely aligned with the EU than the UK"".Mr Thomson, a prominent Brexiteer who has been highly critical of the prime minister's approach, added: ""We have already seen the SNP leaping on this calling for a differential deal in Scotland. ""This arrangement, I feel, is something no Unionist can support. Given that two members of the cabinet have resigned on the basis that the proposals put at risk our Union I want to urge you in the gentlest and strongest terms to follow suit.""Mr Thomson also stressed that he believes Mr Mundell is a ""great Secretary of State"" who is doing an ""incredible job"", and said he would ""support you in whatever you decide"".Mr Mundell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson warned Mrs May last month that they could not back any deal that ""delivers a differentiated settlement for Northern Ireland"", fearing it would be a political gift to the SNP and could fuel the case for Scottish independence. The Scottish government has argued that the deal would effectively allow Northern Ireland to remain in the single market while Scotland has to leave - giving it a competitive advantage that would be ""devastating"" for Scottish jobs and investment.It has said it will hold a symbolic vote on the proposals in the Scottish Parliament before a vote takes place in the House of Commons.The Scottish and Welsh governments have also asked the UK government for face-to-face talks over the agreement next week.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood that Mr Mundell and Ms Davidson would both now resign if they had any ""backbone"", and reiterated that the 35 SNP MPs at Westminster would vote against the deal.Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray said it was now clear that the Conservatives ""are as big a threat to the integrity of the UK as the SNP"". He added: ""This Brexit deal has zero chance of getting through parliament and it is now imperative that the prime minister offers the public a People's Vote with the option of remaining in the EU.""There are major doubts over whether Mrs May can convince enough MPs in the House of Commons to support her Brexit plan, and there have been suggestions some Tory MPs could try to force a no-confidence vote.Mrs May told the Commons on Thursday morning that, as prime minister of the United Kingdom, she has a ""responsibility to people in every part of our country and I intend to honour that promise"". And she described the draft deal as a ""decisive breakthrough"" in the Brexit negotiations as she urged MPs to ""consider the national interest and give it their backing"".Mrs May warned: ""Voting against a deal would take us all back to square one. It would mean more uncertainty, more division, and a failure to deliver on the decision of the British people that we should leave the EU.""If we get behind a deal, we can bring our country back together and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.""Analysis by Sarah Smith, Scotland correspondentGiven that Ms Davidson and Mr Mundell effectively threatened to resign over any deal that introduces different arrangements for Northern Ireland why are they not now considering their positions? Last night Mr Mundell seemed to interpret the deal rather differently from some of his cabinet colleagues, saying: ""I was content to move to the next stage... on the basis that arrangements for Northern Ireland will not undermine the economic or constitutional integrity of the UK."" How does he square that with the warnings from Mr Raab and Ms McVey that the deal threatens the integrity of the UK? Other members of the Scottish Conservative parliamentary team say they want more clarification from the PM on the Union and on future arrangements for the control of UK fishing rights. But many are likely to back the deal.The SNP have consistently argued they want Scotland to remain a member of the EU single market and customs union even if the rest of the UK leaves. The UK government maintains it would not be possible to have different arrangements for Scotland while it remains part of the UK. The worry from Scottish unionists is that allowing a separate regulatory regime for Northern Ireland undercuts that argument and allows the SNP to demand separate arrangements for Scotland.Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday, the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, said the prime minister was ""in a mess of her own making"". And he insisted the choice facing the country was not between ""Mrs May's way or no deal at all"". He said voting down the Brexit agreement in the House of Commons would give the government 28 days to come back with a set of alternative proposals. These could include renegotiation, single market and customs union membership, staying in the EU, a general election or a second referendum on the Brexit terms. Mr Russell said he believed the option of remaining in the EU - which the PM herself mentioned in a statement outside Downing Street after her cabinet meeting - was still ""on the table"".

2018-11-15,Jones referendum shift amid Brexit crisis,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-46220036,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA new Brexit referendum should be held if the prime minister is replaced and no general election is called, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.He said two cabinet ministers quitting over the draft Brexit deal was one of the worst political crises he had seen.Mr Jones has previously backed the idea of a fresh referendum only if a general election failed to end the deadlock.He, and Scotland's first minister, have sent Theresa May a letter scathing of her handling of the EU withdrawal plan.Mr Jones and Nicola Sturgeon told the prime minister it was ""symptomatic of the chaotic approach to the negotiations"" and lacked any ""meaningful engagement"" with their administrations.They demanded a chance to have some input into the political declaration about future UK-EU relations before it was finalised.Speaking later to BBC Wales, Mr Jones said it was ""one of the worst crises I've seen in politics, certainly in my time"".""If this ends up with a leadership election in the Tory party, which just leads to a new prime minister who then carries on without any kind of mandate from the people, that would be completely wrong.""At that point if there is no election there has to be a referendum."" Mr Jones added: ""It's in nobody's interests to have a situation where there seems to be no leadership in the UK government or in parliament.   ""Businesses are starting to worry - there needs to be a way forward here that steps beyond party politics."" By BBC Wales political editor Felicity EvansI noticed a subtle but significant change in Carwyn Jones's position on another referendum this afternoon. Until now, he's been cautious on the subject. Following the Labour line and expressing concern about the implications for devolved nations of not respecting referendum results. Today his tone was markedly different. He argued it would be ""presumptuous"" of politicians not to allow people ""to have their say"" on this new deal. The upheaval of the last 24 hours, along with the concerns he and his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon expressed in a letter this lunchtime, accusing the UK Government of a ""lack of any meaningful engagement with the devolved administrations"" appear to have convinced him that the balance has shifted.Mr Jones says the deal being proposed is ""far from perfect"" but he must be concerned that any successor to Mrs May will pursue a harder Brexit, or perhaps that the brinksmanship currently on display could lead to a no deal departure. He has previously commented that the former could shrink the Welsh economy by a tenth, and the latter would be a ""catastrophe"". Earlier, several Conservative backbenchers - including leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg - revealed they had submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Tories' backbench 1922 Committee.A vote will be triggered if 48 Tory MPs write letters to Sir Graham. It is understood 48 letters have not yet been received.But Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he believed ""Theresa May will be here tomorrow, next week, next month and as we leave the European Union"".""So far not enough letters have gone in to the 1922 committee, so we'll see what happens,"" he told BBC Wales.""The truth is there isn't a majority, I think, for any other leader.""He earlier described the Brexit withdrawal deal as a compromise and not a cave-in to the EU.Disagreements escalated into a crisis on Thursday when Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey resigned in protest at the draft Brexit deal approved by the cabinet following a five-hour meeting on Wednesday. Mr Raab said he ""cannot in good conscience support"" proposals which he said gave the EU a ""veto"" over when the UK could leave a temporary customs union, and which he claimed threatened the integrity of the UK with special arrangements for Northern Ireland.Former Welsh secretary David Jones said Mr Raab was ""absolutely right"" to resign, saying the so-called ""backstop"" plan to prevent a hard border in Ireland was a ""massive problem"".The Clwyd West MP - also a former Brexit minister - told BBC Radio Five Live: ""We are going to be effectively stuck in a customs union almost indefinitely.""The prime minister has always been clear that we can't treat Northern Ireland separately from the rest of the UK and this is what this agreement will potentially do.""Later, in the House of Commons, Tory MPs lined up to condemn the draft withdrawal agreement as the prime minister delivered her statement on it.  But she got support from another former Conservative Welsh Secretary, Stephen Crabb, who said ""the theory of a perfect Brexit"" had ""met the cold reality of hard choices and compromise"".""This is absolutely not the moment to walk away from our responsibilities to govern and provide this country with leadership at this difficult time,"" the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP said.Mrs May agreed, saying there were ""difficult choices to be made ... not according to how we wish the world could be like, but to the reality of the world that we see, and to make those choices pragmatically in the interests of the British people"".Plaid Cymru has confirmed it will oppose the deal, with their parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts lamenting it as one which ""pleases none of the people, all of the time"", as she repeated calls for another referendum.UKIP's leader in the Welsh Assembly, Gareth Bennett, said the plans were ""a complete betrayal"" of Brexit.Meanwhile the chief executive of Aston Martin - the luxury car maker which has a plant in the Vale of Glamorgan - has said the draft Brexit deal was ""good enough"".However, Andy Palmer added that the firm would not halt contingency planning for a no-deal scenario, saying: ""The Tory party needs to agree and then Parliament needs to agree, and I don't think any of that is that easy.""

No rest for them until Sunday 25 November - the day of the ""seal the deal"" Brexit summit between Theresa May and EU leaders.So what do they have to do between now and then?Diplomats from the 27 EU countries must now pore over 585 pages of the draft Brexit withdrawal agreement with lawyers to ensure all will be to each government's liking. If a problem is identified, it will need to be transmitted to the team of Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, as early as this Friday or Saturday.The 27 member states (and Theresa May) also still have to agree what should be in the political declaration on the future EU-UK relationship. This part of the divorce treaty is not legally binding - but it is symbolically important. At the moment the text is solely made up of a series of bullet points and headings. So the pressure is definitely on, leading up to the 25th.But all this could be in vain if the Brexit deal is voted down by the UK parliament in a few weeks' time.The EU knows this is a very real possibility. I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.In fact, he spoke so warmly about the deal - how hard EU and UK negotiators had worked on it, how successful they had been in protecting citizens' rights, the Irish border and the constitutional integrity of the UK - that one colleague commented to me it was as if Mr Barnier, known for his suave French manner, believed they had managed to conjure an exquisitely designed Faberge egg out of the complex Brexit process.No wonder then that he didn't want to engage in the possibility of that egg getting smashed.Truth be told, he's unlikely to face much trouble from the EU side. He is off to Strasbourg on Thursday to schmooze the European parliament - which has a veto over the Brexit deal.MEPs will look at the section of the withdrawal agreement on citizens' right with a particularly critical eye as that is the issue they tend most to focus on. But Mr Barnier has been careful to keep the parliament in the loop on negotiations throughout, so they're unlikely to reject a final agreement.EU countries had also given Ireland an effective veto over the deal if Dublin were unhappy about the provisions for the Irish border.But the Irish prime minister gave the green light to the draft text on Wednesday, so that is no longer an issue.Spain and Gibraltar, and Cyprus and the UK military bases on the island were also thought to be potential pitfalls. The withdrawal agreement sorted them out too.This leaves the concerns the UK's biggest EU trade partners (like France and Germany) had over the so-called ""level playing field"": ensuring that the UK was tied to extra EU regulations in the temporary customs relationship outlined in the Irish backstop, should it one day be triggered.Well, about 100 pages of the draft withdrawal treaty are dedicated to these extra ties - on state aid, environment and labour regulations - ensuring that UK business should not have a competitive advantage over EU ones in a customs partnership.Rights to fish in UK waters after Brexit have not yet been agreed, and the Spanish, French, Danish or Dutch will probably have something to say about that - but it's not a deal breaker at this stage.So, those Europeans wary of political trouble that could disrupt or destroy the careful Brexit deal choreography between now and 25 November (and beyond) look fearfully at the politically volatile UK.This led one EU civil servant late on Wednesday night to jab at the 585 pages of the draft Brexit treaty, muttering: ""You know what? All this could still end up in the bin."""

His verdict on the prime minister's deal is damning. He told me that because of the way the agreement treats Northern Ireland and the rest of the country differently - and the way the country couldn't decide on its own to leave the so-called backstop - that the draft deal is a betrayal of people's trust. Mr Raab, who says he told the chief whip straight after cabinet yesterday that he would quit, says the prime minister can still change course, and should be ready to walk away with no deal. He insists the short-term disruption that might entail - which many of his colleagues think would be catastrophic - would be worth it. Better in his view to tolerate short-term pain, than lock ourselves into a dreadful arrangement for years and years to come.  That prospect horrifies others in the government, and on the backbenches too. But it's a risk worth taking he says - claiming it's the best way to proceed, to be willing to risk no deal in the face of what he describes as the EU's ""blackmail"". The alternative for the prime minister, carrying on like this, he says, is inevitable defeat in the Commons and who knows what would happen then. Might he put himself forward if it all falls apart? His answer was it is ""irresponsible"" to be talking about that right now. But notably, not ruling himself out and knowing, perhaps in a few days' or weeks' time, he might have to give a very different answer. 10:00 GMT: A resignation in itself is not a surprise - but the departure of the Brexit secretary might be the domino that causes everything else to fall.It's not just that it was his job to make the policy work. It's because he has just given unhappy Brexiteers someone to rally round, and someone who sees himself as a potential challenger to the PM.After his departure, it becomes extremely difficult for other Brexiteers unhappy about the deal to stay on.And in the last few minutes Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has decided to leave the government.There is speculation about International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt too, although sources close to her say a departure today is far from definite.Meanwhile, No 10 is busy trying to explain its policy this morning to opposition politicians and then to Parliament in the next hour.But there have been three resignations from government - Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara was the first to quit - and it's not even 10:00 GMT.It's too early to say if this morning's storm will be a hurricane that will sweep the policy, and maybe the prime minister away."

But how could this happen?Each party has its own rules for selecting a leader. Under the Conservatives' system, there are two ways to trigger a leadership contest.One, unsurprisingly, is if the leader resigns. The other is if 15% of Conservative MPs write letters saying they no longer have confidence in her.These letters have to be sent to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, which is made up of all backbench Conservative MPs.The 1922 Committee chairman - who is currently an MP called Graham Brady - does not reveal how many letters he has received until it reaches the 15% mark, which means 48 letters would have to be received.This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs that could happen as soon as the next day. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year.But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.The 1922 Committee sets the timetable for the contest.Tory MPs then choose two candidates to present to a vote of the wider membership of the party.If necessary, they whittle the field down to two with a series of ballots where the lowest-ranking person is eliminated after each round.Then it is time for the party members to vote for the winner. The two candidates would be expected to take part in debates to put their cases forward to members before the final voting deadline.If there is only one candidate, that person becomes leader with no need for a vote from members.Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister."
2018-11-15,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20181115221922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46212838,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship.It's a long read - 585 pages long - and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise?Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least £39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit is due to happen on 29 March 2019. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"".The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November.If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it?If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK.The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"".Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market.One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"".There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage.The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK.""So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised.Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?"

They are: a pre-Christmas deal with the EU, or an admission that a deal is not possible.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, told the Today programme on Monday that in this scenario Parliament would take over. Downing Street has a ready response to that idea: only the government has executive powers to negotiate, so Parliament has limited influence.But parliamentarians on all sides have been holding talks among themselves and with Commons officials over the last year, working out just what Parliament could do in the event that MPs reject every option on the table: deal and no deal.John Bercow, the speaker, has been consulted by senior parliamentarians. He has been told that around this time in the Brexit calendar he may well find that the executive is so ""enfeebled"" that Parliament may have to take over.I am told that the speaker has listened with great care to MPs but has been careful not to reveal his hand. Senior Commons officials have suggested that unless Parliament is able to amend legislation then the ability of MPs to shape Brexit will be limited. This explains why the government is so keen that its ""meaningful"" vote should be held on a non-amendable, take-it-or-leave-it basis.Senior pro-European MPs are hoping that the speaker will break with convention and allow MPs to hold votes with bite. Tory and Labour MPs have been looking at the way in which the Labour frontbench has successfully forced the government's hand in recent months - requiring ministers to publish government documents - through a parliamentary device which petitions the Queen.Brexiteers in cabinet view the speaker with great suspicion and believe he is biding his time to help Remainers in the Commons. It should not be forgotten, however, that the speaker's diminishing set of friends on the Tory side include Brexit supporters. They also have his ear.The greatest hopes among MPs hoping that Parliament may take over rest not in the arcane world of Commons rules and procedures, but in the simple belief that no government can function without the support of Parliament. Many MPs have cast aside Erskine May, the bible of Parliamentary procedure, and have instead chosen to look to history for inspiration. Their book of choice is Six Minutes in May which describes how Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain in May 1940 after the debacle of the Norway campaign. A vote on the most neutral motion of all - whether to adjourn the Commons - was held. Chamberlain won. But the catastrophic loss of support on his benches and elsewhere spelled the end. The Six Minutes, as Jim Naughtie wrote in the New Statesman, refers to the length of the Commons voting division measured by an egg timer on the clerks' table.In May 1940 it was soon clear what should happen. The person from the largest party who could command the greatest support across Parliament - even though he had been at the heart of planning the Norway operation - succeeded Chamberlain. Churchill became prime minister.Even though Boris Johnson likes to think of himself as a 21st century Churchill there is no such figure on the horizon. We can expect lots more fog before another moment of clarity arrives."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland.

Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other ministers to change a specific part of the draft withdrawal deal regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.Both sides want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"". And a source said of Theresa May's deal: ""Even if you don't mind it ideologically, you can't be fooled about getting it through the Commons.""The source suggested that if changes weren't made, resignations from Brexiteers still in the cabinet were ""not off the table"".The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.Meanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"".She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"".She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. She added: ""He does feel some of it (the hurt) himself - he's bound to. We've been married for 38 years, that's a long time.""Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. The MP for North East Cambridgeshire - who is a Leave supporter - has been a health minister since January.A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.In other developments:The draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.

In her first interview in her new job, Ms Rudd called on any colleagues planning to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May to ""think again"".""This is not a time for changing our leader,"" she said.""This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help: that's the whole of the country.""Stephen Hammond will take over from Mr Barclay at the department for health and social care.The government also announced replacements for two junior ministers who resigned over Mrs May's deal. John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara, and Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman. Mrs May agreed a draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit with her cabinet on Wednesday, which had already been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.But the deal led to a backlash from some Brexit-supporting MPs, including Mr Raab and Ms McVey. Around 20 Tory MPs have publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, with more thought to have written to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to call for a vote on her leadership.

Dr DeFeo told the court he had ""enormous hopes invested"" in the Labour MP, continuing: ""I never dreamed in my darkest dreams - I never thought I would have to be sitting here [giving evidence].""It is with the greatest reluctance I have to do this.""To do otherwise, I cannot.

A mini-reshuffle has also seen Amber Rudd confirmed as the new work and pensions secretary after Esther McVey's resignation on Thursday. The BBC understands Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom could oversee a meeting over the weekend of pro-Brexit cabinet members who have concerns about the deal.Mr Gove and Mr Fox are expected be present, along with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. The news came as more Conservatives expressed unhappiness with Mrs May's leadership and urged a confidence vote. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said about 20 Tories have, so far, publicly stated they have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM over her handling of Brexit.This is some way short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote under Conservative Party rules. One of those to do so, ex-minister Mark Francois, said the draft agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU was ""truly awful"" and the prime minister ""just doesn't listen"" to concerns within her party.Ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told the BBC's Politics Live that although he could not be sure of the number of letters submitted, he believed it was ""close"" to 48 and a contest was ""imminent"". If this happened, he suggested the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, would ""collectively agree"" which single candidate was best-placed to deliver the Brexit they wanted and back them. But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mrs May would win any contest ""decisively"" and ""deserved to"" since there was ""no plausible alternative"" to her approach. Rumours had been rife that Mr Gove, a key figure in the 2016 Leave campaign, would follow fellow Brexiteers out of the cabinet in protest at the EU withdrawal agreement.But the environment secretary, who reportedly rejected an offer to make him Brexit secretary after Dominic Raab's exit, told reporters on Friday he was focused on working in cabinet to get ""the right deal in the future"".  Asked if he had confidence in the PM, Mr Gove said: ""I absolutely do.""He added: ""I'm also looking forward to continuing to work with all my government colleagues and all my colleagues in parliament in order to make sure that we get the best future for Britain.""International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told an event in Bristol: ""We are not elected to do what we want to do, but to do what is in the national interest.""Speaking in public for the first time since the withdrawal agreement was signed off by cabinet, Mr Fox said he hopes MPs ""will take a rational and reasonable view"" of the deal.He added: ""I hope across parliament we recognise that a deal is better than no deal, and businesses require certainty - it's in our national interest to provide certainty as soon as possible.""By BBC Assistant Political Editor Norman SmithMichael Gove is not resigning because he thinks that even at this very late hour, he is the person who can make Theresa May change course with Brexit.This is a huge relief for Theresa May, who meanwhile has been carrying on with business as usual by trying to sell her deal.Theresa May has made it absolutely clear that she is going nowhere.Senior placed Tory MPs are saying they have reached the magic 48 letters needed for a vote of confidence against Theresa May, but Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the 1922 committee - is giving precious little away.A Conservative party leadership challenge is most definitely looming, if not this morning or this afternoon, by the weekend.Michael Gove is a bit of a man of mystery, but if he doesn't take the Brexit Secretary role, it begs the question of who would take that job.Mr Gove's decision to stay was a boost for Mrs May, who followed up a defiant Downing Street press conference on Thursday with a live phone-in on Friday morning on LBC radio, during which two callers said she should stand aside.She compared herself to her cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott who she said had ""kept at the crease and carried on"".Ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingdale is among the latest Tory MP to demand a vote of confidence in the PM while a number of MPs, including Mr Francois and Adam Holloway, publicly tweeted copies of their letter.

The bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, paid tribute to Mrs May, but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK.BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the consensus from the meeting was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. The government unveiled its long-awaited draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU, over 585 pages.But Mrs May is facing opposition from across the political spectrum to the draft deal, which must be approved by Parliament, with critics saying it will leave the UK indefinitely tied to the EU. It is also understood that a group of cabinet ministers are also considering whether to try to force Mrs May to make some changes to the withdrawal deal."

The Privileges and Conduct Committee, which oversees members' behaviour, said earlier this week that the 82-year-old peer had ""failed to act on his personal honour by sexually harassing the complainant and offering her corrupt inducements to sleep with him"".But when the issue was debated in the Lords on Thursday, peers voted by  by 101 to 78 to send the case back to the committee to look at it again in the interest of ""natural justice and fairness"".Ms Sanghera said the allegations, which date back to 2006, had been upheld three times in the House of Lords and to now be told, in effect, that she was not ""believed"" realised her ""worst fears"". She said peers seemed to be more concerned about Lord Lester's reputation than hers, while those who had spoken out on her behalf had been ""sidelined"". ""Sitting there watching the debate for me personally felt as if I was being subjected to being bullied from afar yet again,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""I felt re-victimised. It was disheartening to hear members of the House of Lords straining to discuss me as an individual, what I did, what I didn't do. And nobody in that room, actually very few talked about the real issues here, the issues of sexual harassment and bullying.""Ms Sanghera, a campaigner against forced marriage, was not named in the Lords report but waived her anonymity, in an interview with the Times, to encourage other women to speak out about harassment.She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show that the peers' actions had sent completely the ""wrong message"" to victims of sexual harassment and bullying. She said she would still encourage victims to speak out, but added that she ""cannot advise any person at the moment out there who is a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a peer to give them confidence to come forward because I would not want them to go through what I went through"". She said the Lords Commissioner for Standards, who carried out the original investigation, had followed the procedures laid down for her by peers and Lord Lester had not objected at any point during the probe. But Lord Lester, a veteran human rights lawyer who worked for several decades on gender equality and race relations, has welcomed the Lords' decision. He thanked peers who supported the amendment tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Pannick for ""recognising the importance of process and now look forward to restoring my reputation"". Lord Pannick argued that the investigation process was ""manifestly unfair"" and that Lord Lester should have had the opportunity to cross-question his accuser if, as he claimed, the commissioner was unwilling to do so. But the decision to refer it back to the committee was criticised by deputy Lords Speaker, the former Labour MP Lord McFall, who said it was ""deeply disappointing"". "
2018-11-16,Ministers in 'denial' over UK poverty,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46236642,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters are in a ""state of denial"" about poverty, a UN expert has said following a 12-day tour of the UK.Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty, said despite being in the one of the world's richest countries he had encountered ""misery"".Levels of child poverty are ""staggering"" and 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, the Australian said.The government rejected his analysis, pointing to rising household incomes.Prof Alston, an expert in human rights law based at New York University, visited locations including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Essex, Glasgow, London and Newcastle on a fact-finding mission.He met people affected by poverty as well as government officials, discussing the impact of austerity, changes to benefits and local government funding.At a news conference in London, he said he witnessed ""a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them"".Quoting figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, he said that more than 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, meaning they lived on less than £70 a week or went without essentials such as housing, food, clothing or heating.A fifth of the population, amounting to 14 million people, are living in poverty, Prof Alston said.Prof Alston used a new measure by the Social Metrics Commission to come up with the figure of 14m people in the UK in poverty.It is a measure of ""relative poverty"", meaning it looks at the percentage of people living with less than 55% of the median income, taking into account costs such as childcare, housing, debt and disability.But the government has preferred to use the measure of ""absolute poverty"".This counts the number of people in households with less than 60% of the median income as it was in 2010/11, so it shows how living standards of low-income households have changed over time.By that measure, the government says there are a million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2010.Among experts in the media, think tanks, Parliament and organisations such as the National Audit Office, Prof Alston said there was ""close to unanimity"" that Britain was not doing enough to combat poverty.But he said the view from ministers was the opposite. ""Ministers with whom I met told me that things are going well that they don't see any big problems and they are happy with the way their policies are playing out,"" Prof Alston said.He said the government was preoccupied with reducing welfare dependency but said he could not believe ministers were as happy with the results as they claimed to be.Prof Alston said: ""The era of connectivity and the era of social media makes it much less sustainable to have this dramatic difference between people living the high life, a higher life than has ever been lived before, and at the other end, people who can't afford a tin of beans, can't afford the seventh meal of the week.""by Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondentBritain's poorest communities often feel ignored, that politicians aren't interested in their experiences. For a UN representative to hold public meetings, to seek out their concerns, mattered.Some of the gatherings were packed - hundreds of people took the opportunity to be heard.What emerged for Philip Alston was an astounding disconnect between what he heard at those meetings, backed by other research he'd done, and the discussions he held with the ministers who oversee the very system causing such hardship for many people.Some will ask why the UN is looking at poverty in the UK - one of the world's richest nations. The answer, said Prof Alston, is that the government has supported these UN investigations in other countries, and couldn't therefore oppose the legitimacy of his visit here.These harsh criticisms of the government's approach to the poor may not make their lives better immediately. But their daily struggles have appalled the UN, and in time, that might matter.The approach to benefits was ""punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous"", Prof Alston said. He gave the example of ""draconian sanctions"" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment.Many of the ""harsh"" policies could be ended ""overnight"" at little cost, he claimed.These included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants.Prof Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was ""a perfect way to punish families"".Welfare changes have disproportionately affected women, especially single parents, he said.""If you got a group of misogynists in a room, and said guys, how can we make this system work for men and not for women, they wouldn't have come up with too many other ideas than what's already in place.""He also warned that the poor would ""bear the brunt"" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families £400 a year.""In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,"" he said.Prof Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year.A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We completely disagree with this analysis.""She said that household incomes have ""never been higher"", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010.It is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world.In 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the ""bedroom tax"", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller, undermined the right to adequate housing.On that occasion, ministers said her report was a ""misleading Marxist diatribe"" and made an official complaint to the UN."
2018-11-16,How could May turmoil affect Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46233813,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has vowed to see her Brexit deal through, but as this week's events have shown, a lot can change in politics - and fast. Here are the possible scenarios of her next move and what it could mean for the future of Brexit. The prime minister managed to get her draft withdrawal agreement through cabinet on Wednesday, only to see two members resign in protest at it the following day.Some had expected further walkouts but Michael Gove and Liam Fox, both prominent Brexiteers, have rallied behind her. The threat of a no-confidence vote from Tory MPs remains, but if she does stay on office - and her defiant performance at a Downing Street press conference and on an LBC radio phone-in suggests she is not going anywhere - can she stay on course with her deal?First up will be the emergency EU summit on 25 November where the UK and 27 EU member states will meet to sign off on the withdrawal agreement.The noises from the continent have been positive, with Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was pleased with the progress and France's Finance Minister saying the deal was ""good news for the French economy"".EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Theresa May at a meeting of member states' ambassadors in Brussels this morning but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK.The consensus, according to our man in Brussels, Adam Fleming, was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. But officials point out that European Council President Donald Tusk has left the door open to the 25 November summit being cancelled if something ""extraordinary"" happens.Diplomats' lives in Brussels are now a combination of missed meals, late nights, meetings and speculation about the state of the British government, says Adam Fleming, who is on a similar schedule.Katya Adler: EU determined to keep calm and carry on with Brexit dealWhile the determination of Mrs May makes this scenario seem unlikely, it is possible that with continuing criticism from her own party, and perhaps more resignations in the offing, the PM could throw in the towel. If she leaves No 10 over the issue of her withdrawal agreement, the UK could then change direction entirely over its exit from the European Union. Brexiteers like David Davis and Jacob-Rees Mogg want to go back to Brussels and renegotiate - something EU leaders have made clear they are not open to. Others, like pro-Remain Tory Anna Soubry, have suggested a government of national unity, seeing a coalition of MPs from all sides come together to get us through - a concept normally associated with times of war. But again, Mrs May has made clear her intention is to stick it out. This scenario would make the PM's fighting spirit null and void. If the Conservative Party wants to oust her, MPs have to write letters to the chair of the 1922 Committee - made up of backbenchers - saying they have no confidence in her. If the chair, Sir Graham Brady, gets 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of Tory MPs - a vote of confidence is triggered and a secret ballot takes place. If Mrs May wins, she becomes immune from another challenge for a year. But if she loses, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.It is a risk for Brexiteers, who would face the prospect of trying to persuade Mrs May to change course on Brexit for another 12 months. But if the party votes against her, it becomes a battle between its two opposing wings, and the direction of Brexit could be determined by which side comes out on top. So let's say she survives the attempts of her own colleagues to oust her and gets her deal signed off in Brussels - then there is the small matter of the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs.As things stand, with dissent from her own backbenchers, anger from her partners in the DUP, and Labour and the rest of the opposition lined up to vote against it, the numbers do not add up to getting her withdrawal agreement through.  There is rumoured pressure for her to allow a free vote of all Conservative MPs - a highly unusual move which would involve suspending collective cabinet responsibility.Her predecessor David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign for Leave or Remain as they saw fit during the referendum - but a vote in the Commons is a different matter.Downing Street has said there will be no free vote.And if the past three days are anything to go by, the PM will continue to hammer home her message that the public wants Parliament to ""get on with it"" and hope that is enough to win MPs over. She will try to present MPs with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between her deal or no deal in the hope enough waverers will be frightened into backing her.Labour will be using every weapon in their Parliamentary armoury to ensure other options are put to the vote.If MPs do reject the deal we are into full scale constitutional crisis territory. Britain would still be on course to leave the EU on 29 March - it's the law - but all sorts of possibilities come into play that could cause delays and renegotiations.It would be one way out of her bind if the deal is voted down, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out going back to the public to ask for their say on the deal, and her Leave-supporting critics feel the same way. Prominent pro-Remainers from both sides of the House - including Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Chuka Umunna - alongside the Lib Dems and Greens and a growing public campaign for a ""people's vote"" think differently.But unless Mrs May performs a shocking U-turn, or there is a new prime minister, it would be down to Parliamentary manouvering to get a vote on it, which might not pass, although Labour has not ruled out backing a referendum.Time is also running out to hold a campaign before Brexit day, so Article 50 might have to be extended, something Brussels might agree to, but a lot would depend on the proposed question on the ballot paper.This is Labour's preferred outcome. It they win they would have to ask for an extension to Article 50 to give them a chance to go to Brussels and negotiate their version of Brexit.Mrs May is unlikely to be keen on trying to get backing for another election, given her experiences last year, but in the current climate it feels like almost anything is possible."
2018-11-16,Can May get Brexit deal through Commons?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46239782,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit deal which has been negotiated by the UK and the EU is expected to be agreed at a special EU summit on 25 November.After that, MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"".Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 51 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. Then there are, perhaps, a further 14 Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."
2018-11-16,What do May's Tory enemies object to?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46214526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May's draft Brexit agreement has left some of her fellow Conservative MPs seething. There's a broad range of objection, but these are some of their key complaints.For the Brexit faithful, it all comes down to control. Esther McVey, one of two senior members of the UK government to quit because of the proposed deal, did so because it fails to ""regain control"" from Brussels.""Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy... This deal fails to do this,"" she wrote.Her claim directly contrasts with what Theresa May said on Thursday: ""This deal... brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union.""So what exactly are the objections and how does the government defend them?This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net £10.8bn. It has agreed to continue paying similar amounts until the end of the ""transition period"" - the time after Brexit Day on 29 March 2019 that both sides have set aside to agree a trade deal. The payments will form part of the ""divorce settlement"" - expected to be at least £39bn - which the UK has agreed to pay the EU to cover its financial obligations for leaving.The transition period is due to end on the last day of December 2020, but it may not. The draft agreement leaves the option of it being extended - if a trade deal isn't sorted out. If the transition is extended, it can only happen once and for a limited period.This means a previous commitment by Theresa May that any extension would be for a ""matter of months"", cannot be guaranteed, especially as the decision to extend the transition has to be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.So if the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU which will be agreed separately.However, supporters of the draft deal say once the UK leaves the transition period, its big annual payments will end. This is why the prime minister and her supporters claim the agreement allows the UK to regain control of its money.During the transition period, freedom of movement rules apply, meaning EU citizens will be free to live and work in the UK and vice versa.Once the UK exits transition, it will be able to set its own rules on immigration.This is why the prime minster claims the UK will be ""taking back control"" of its borders and that the country will be ending free movement.But if the transition period continues, so EU citizens will be able to carry on moving to the UK.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the gremlin here for many Brexit believers. It has the final say on disputes between people and governments on matters of EU law. Its opponents say the last word should always be with a UK court.Mrs May agrees. Two years ago she declared: ""We are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.""But during the transition, the UK will have to follow all EU rules and abide by ECJ rulings.Opponents argue this leaves the UK as a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. And if the transition period is extended into a backstop, the ECJ's jurisdiction will also be extended.But Mrs May's backers say the UK will be free of the ECJ once the transition is over. Another objection, voiced by MP Mark Francois, is that under the agreement the UK has committed to keeping ""equivalent standards"" with the EU in employment, environmental and social policy. In effect, the UK ""would continue to take EU law"" says Mr Francois. Furthermore, if the backstop is triggered then disputes about putting the agreement into practice will be settled by an arbitration panel, consisting of people nominated by both sides. That panel must refer any matter which concerns the interpretation of EU law to the ECJOnce the UK exits transition, and assuming the backstop isn't triggered, it will be able to implement any agreed free trade deals it strikes with other countries.If the transition period is extended, that is the backstop is introduced, free trade deals will have to wait.And if the UK becomes a single customs territory, which is what would happen under the backstop, it won't be able to implement any deals on goods (but it will be able to do some deals it reaches on services).Deciding when the backstop comes to an end, will not only be up to the UK. It will also have to be agreed with the EU. Ms McVey and likeminded enemies of the deal fear the UK could become ""trapped"" in this arrangement, limiting its ability to strike trade deals.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

Meanwhile French PM Edouard Philippe said there was a need to prepare for a no-deal because of UK ""uncertainty"".The EU has set out a series of meetings leading up to 25 November when it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.However leaders admit that there is still much ground to cover after the UK Prime Minister Theresa May won backing on Wednesday from her cabinet for the 585-page draft agreement. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said.On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said she was pleased that progress had been made. But following news of resignations from Mrs May's cabinet, including the UK's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, she said it was possible that Britain may still leave without a deal.She also said that there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement. ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further,"" she said. Mr Philippe appeared to echo her sentiment over UK political uncertainty. ""It will escape no-one that the current political situation in Britain could fuel uncertainty... over the ratification of the accord,"" he said. The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"".French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules.Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya AdlerThe EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time.I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"".Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"" and ""optimistic"", adding: ""We are pinning our hopes on it.""Speaking on Thursday alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk, Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"".Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"".He laid out the timetable for the days ahead.Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.""Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us.""Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019.If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict."

So far, nothing - none of the screaming headlines back in the UK - is managing to distract the EU from its focus.    This, first and foremost, is because Theresa May stands firmly behind the Brexit deal. And Europeans view her as the UK's chief Brexit negotiator. UK cabinet ministers - even Brexit secretaries - can come and go, but as long as the prime minister remains on board, EU leaders believe the seal-the-deal Brexit summit will go ahead. There is also zero - really, truly, honestly, not just saying it - zero-intention or appetite in Europe to start renegotiating the withdrawal deal with the UK. It’s the EU-U.K. political parallel universe again. Dutch PM Rutte and Michel Barnier today saying no ‘bargaining’ no ‘meaningful renegotiation’ https://t.co/AdvvqFqVfgEnd of Twitter post  by @BBCkatyaadlerFor Europe's leaders, the document is the result of 19 months of intense and tense negotiations working towards something (Brexit) that none of them wants and which has already sucked up an enormous amount of time, energy and money across the European capitals in preparation. Of course, the EU would rather the UK changed its mind and stayed in the club. But if it is leaving then this, they say, is the deal on the table.  The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told EU ambassadors on Friday that the European Union should not start a last minute bargaining process. The EU should protect its principles, he said: meaning standing by the backstop guarantee on the Irish border. Brussels wants to close this chapter and move on. But remember: we're talking about the divorce deal here. Not the future EU-UK trade deal.  Sure, EU and UK negotiators are hammering out a document this weekend to outline the kind of relationship they intend to have with one another after Brexit but - spoiler alert - when it comes to the chapter on future economic relations, expect their text to be suitably vague. And, anyway, this document unlike the Brexit withdrawal agreement is not legally binding. Detailed negotiations on the new EU-UK trade deal will only begin after Brexit day and the UK is legally, if not politically, free to choose - and change - the kind of economic relationship it wants with the bloc: very close à la EEA (European Economic Area),or a more arm's-length deal like Canada has.But, since it takes two to tango in negotiations, each choice has consequences under EU law.  More from Katya:Volatile UK politics could bin Brexit deal, worries EUA Canada-like free-trade agreement can never - whatever David Davis and others promised - offer frictionless trade. And it would lead to a customs border on the island of Ireland unless a separate arrangement is agreed for Northern Ireland.Whereas being a member of the EEA would mean the UK accepting freedom of movement and paying into the EU budget. But the by-now hugely controversial EU-UK customs relationship outlined in the Brexit withdrawal treaty need never come about. It is an on-paper insurance policy to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland since, as already discussed, no-one knows right now what the future economic relationship will look like between the EU and the UK.  The reason it is a UK-wide customs arrangement is because Theresa May, not the EU, wanted it to be.  And, if a new trade deal is ready between the two sides before the end of the transition period - the end of 2020 - then the ""backstop"" customs partnership would be superseded.  If it isn't ready, the UK government could ask the EU to extend the transition period instead, though that of course has consequences too: ongoing freedom of movement, payments into the EU budget etc. Please upgrade your browserThe options don't look appetising perhaps but, as I have said, if the UK parliament now rejects the Brexit withdrawal deal, hoping to renegotiate a ""better"" (i.e more successfully cake-and-eat-it) deal, then the EU doesn't want to know. But they would likely ""freeze"" the Article 50 process if the UK were to hold a general election or a second referendum. Out of self-interest, of course.  Firstly, because the EU wants to avoid a costly, chaotic no-deal scenario and, secondly, because as France's Emmanuel Macron has said so often, they will keep the door open until the last moment in case the UK should change its mind about leaving. But, deep down, Europeans think a nationwide change of heart is unlikely and that the Brexit deal will in the end be signed.  Which is why, in stark contrast to the UK media obsession with the current political turmoil, Brexit is far, far down the running order of evening news programmes across Europe.   "
2018-11-16,Searching questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-46236022,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWe all do it - we don't quite understand something, so we reach for our phones and Google it.And Brexit is no different.Here we answer the five most-googled questions to do with Brexit over the past 24 hours.Don't worry, we promise to keep it simple.Brexit - short for ""British exit"" - is the process of the UK leaving the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work.The UK had a referendum in June 2016 where it voted to leave the EU, which it's been part of for more than 40 years. But the exit didn't happen straight away - it's happening on 29 March 2019.After Brexit was voted for, negotiations started between the UK and the EU.The negotiations are over the ""divorce"" deal. This is a withdrawal agreement which sets out how exactly we leave the EU - not what will happen after we leave. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Theresa May presented that deal. Here are some key points:This has been one of the biggest sticking points of the whole thing.Neither the UK or the EU want a visible or ""hard"" border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with guard posts and checks. So they've agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - that's just another word for a deal to make sure a hard border never happens.It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.The backstop would only be introduced if a trade deal between the EU and the UK isn't sorted out during the transitional period.But this bit is controversial. Some people say it means the UK would still be tied to EU rules while others don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having different regulations to the rest of the UK.On 25 November, the prime minister will try and get European leaders to officially back the deal.If approved, she then has to take it to MPs for a vote in Parliament. That's expected to happen in December.At the moment it looks like her deal would be defeated.She doesn't have enough Conservative MPs to force it through and there are MPs from all parties who aren't happy with what's being suggested.Well, it is written into UK law that Brexit is going to happen.But some people are calling for a second referendum (they call it a ""People's Vote""), which would basically ask the question: ""Do you want the UK to leave the EU, now we know what the deal is?""If that happened, then Brexit could potentially be reversed - but Theresa May has repeatedly said there won't be another referendum.*The list of most searched for questions was provided by Google Trends.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here."

2018-11-16,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-16,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117042216/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.The publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.Some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.Mark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK ""half in and half out"" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.But Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to ""stop and reflect"", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.""All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.""If there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would ""easily"" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying ""when pen comes to paper"" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.By Susana Mendonça, BBC political correspondentWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as ""collective responsibility"". But the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in. This apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an ""embryonic"" stage but will they get their tweaks?Andrea Leadsom thinks there's ""still more to be done"" and that they ""do still have more time"" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something ""winnable and supportable"".The four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.Speaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: ""What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.""I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.""Among her concerns was that ""the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement"" with the EU, she said.She added: ""I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.""The cabinet ""gang of five"" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"".The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.Ahead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to ""tweaks"" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said ""nothing fundamental"" could change.Our correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU.The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter ""some kind of bargaining process"" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year.""I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,"" he told Sky News.Meanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"".She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"".She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. On Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a ""social media blitz"" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics. Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.In other developments:The draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.

2018-11-17,The withdrawal agreement - what it all means,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46237012,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues. Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.   Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Barclay was not a household name and it was a big promotion for him.But he also described the 46-year-old as ultra-loyal, having never rebelled against the government.

Ms Rudd said she was ""delighted"" to be given the role, and saw it as her job to ""try to iron out"" the issues with Universal Credit. In her first interview in her new job, Ms Rudd called on any colleagues planning to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May to ""think again"".""This is not a time for changing our leader,"" she said.""This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help: that's the whole of the country.""Stephen Hammond will take over from Mr Barclay at the department for health and social care.The government also announced replacements for two junior ministers who resigned over Mrs May's deal. John Penrose will join the Northern Ireland office, replacing Shailesh Vara, and Kwasi Kwarteng will go to the Department for Exiting the EU, replacing Suella Braverman. Mrs May agreed a draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit with her cabinet on Wednesday, which had already been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.But the deal led to a backlash from some Brexit-supporting MPs, including Mr Raab and Ms McVey. Around 20 Tory MPs have publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, with more thought to have written to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to call for a vote on her leadership. But Mrs May responded to critics saying she will stay in No 10 and see the deal through. "

Dr DeFeo told the court he had ""enormous hopes invested"" in the Labour MP, continuing: ""I never dreamed in my darkest dreams - I never thought I would have to be sitting here [giving evidence].""It is with the greatest reluctance I have to do this.""To do otherwise, I cannot. It's morally and legally unacceptable not to.""The MP's former campaigns and communications manager said she visited his house on 24 July and spent no less than two hours discussing the ""nitty gritty"" of a charity lease. He said he could not give a specific time but said it had been ""quite late"" and she had arrived in her car alone. The court has heard Ms Onasanya was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) after her car was clocked in Thorney, near Peterborough, at 22:03 BST on 24 July.She returned the paperwork naming the driver as Aleks Antipow, a previous tenant of a property the siblings rented out in Cambridge. The jury heard he was in Russia at the time of the incident had had never driven the MP's car.

2018-11-17,How could May turmoil affect Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46233813,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has vowed to see her Brexit deal through, but as this week's events have shown, a lot can change in politics - and fast. Here are the possible scenarios of her next move and what it could mean for the future of Brexit. The prime minister managed to get her draft withdrawal agreement through cabinet on Wednesday, only to see two members resign in protest at it the following day.Some had expected further walkouts but Michael Gove and Liam Fox, both prominent Brexiteers, have rallied behind her. The threat of a no-confidence vote from Tory MPs remains, but if she does stay on office - and her defiant performance at a Downing Street press conference and on an LBC radio phone-in suggests she is not going anywhere - can she stay on course with her deal?First up will be the emergency EU summit on 25 November where the UK and 27 EU member states will meet to sign off on the withdrawal agreement.The noises from the continent have been positive, with Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was pleased with the progress and France's Finance Minister saying the deal was ""good news for the French economy"".EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Theresa May at a meeting of member states' ambassadors in Brussels this morning but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK.The consensus, according to our man in Brussels, Adam Fleming, was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. But officials point out that European Council President Donald Tusk has left the door open to the 25 November summit being cancelled if something ""extraordinary"" happens.Diplomats' lives in Brussels are now a combination of missed meals, late nights, meetings and speculation about the state of the British government, says Adam Fleming, who is on a similar schedule.Katya Adler: EU determined to keep calm and carry on with Brexit dealWhile the determination of Mrs May makes this scenario seem unlikely, it is possible that with continuing criticism from her own party, and perhaps more resignations in the offing, the PM could throw in the towel. If she leaves No 10 over the issue of her withdrawal agreement, the UK could then change direction entirely over its exit from the European Union. Brexiteers like David Davis and Jacob-Rees Mogg want to go back to Brussels and renegotiate - something EU leaders have made clear they are not open to. Others, like pro-Remain Tory Anna Soubry, have suggested a government of national unity, seeing a coalition of MPs from all sides come together to get us through - a concept normally associated with times of war. But again, Mrs May has made clear her intention is to stick it out. This scenario would make the PM's fighting spirit null and void. If the Conservative Party wants to oust her, MPs have to write letters to the chair of the 1922 Committee - made up of backbenchers - saying they have no confidence in her. If the chair, Sir Graham Brady, gets 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of Tory MPs - a vote of confidence is triggered and a secret ballot takes place. If Mrs May wins, she becomes immune from another challenge for a year. But if she loses, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.It is a risk for Brexiteers, who would face the prospect of trying to persuade Mrs May to change course on Brexit for another 12 months. But if the party votes against her, it becomes a battle between its two opposing wings, and the direction of Brexit could be determined by which side comes out on top. So let's say she survives the attempts of her own colleagues to oust her and gets her deal signed off in Brussels - then there is the small matter of the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs.As things stand, with dissent from her own backbenchers, anger from her partners in the DUP, and Labour and the rest of the opposition lined up to vote against it, the numbers do not add up to getting her withdrawal agreement through.  There is rumoured pressure for her to allow a free vote of all Conservative MPs - a highly unusual move which would involve suspending collective cabinet responsibility.Her predecessor David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign for Leave or Remain as they saw fit during the referendum - but a vote in the Commons is a different matter.Downing Street has said there will be no free vote.And if the past three days are anything to go by, the PM will continue to hammer home her message that the public wants Parliament to ""get on with it"" and hope that is enough to win MPs over. She will try to present MPs with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between her deal or no deal in the hope enough waverers will be frightened into backing her.Labour will be using every weapon in their Parliamentary armoury to ensure other options are put to the vote.If MPs do reject the deal we are into full scale constitutional crisis territory. Britain would still be on course to leave the EU on 29 March - it's the law - but all sorts of possibilities come into play that could cause delays and renegotiations.It would be one way out of her bind if the deal is voted down, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out going back to the public to ask for their say on the deal, and her Leave-supporting critics feel the same way. Prominent pro-Remainers from both sides of the House - including Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Chuka Umunna - alongside the Lib Dems and Greens and a growing public campaign for a ""people's vote"" think differently.But unless Mrs May performs a shocking U-turn, or there is a new prime minister, it would be down to Parliamentary manouvering to get a vote on it, which might not pass, although Labour has not ruled out backing a referendum.Time is also running out to hold a campaign before Brexit day, so Article 50 might have to be extended, something Brussels might agree to, but a lot would depend on the proposed question on the ballot paper.This is Labour's preferred outcome. It they win they would have to ask for an extension to Article 50 to give them a chance to go to Brussels and negotiate their version of Brexit.Mrs May is unlikely to be keen on trying to get backing for another election, given her experiences last year, but in the current climate it feels like almost anything is possible."

A mini-reshuffle has also seen Amber Rudd confirmed as the new work and pensions secretary after Esther McVey's resignation on Thursday. The BBC understands Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom could oversee a meeting over the weekend of pro-Brexit cabinet members who have concerns about the deal.Mr Gove and Mr Fox are expected be present, along with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling. The news came as more Conservatives expressed unhappiness with Mrs May's leadership and urged a confidence vote. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said about 20 Tories have, so far, publicly stated they have submitted letters of no confidence in the PM over her handling of Brexit.This is some way short of the 48 needed to trigger a vote under Conservative Party rules. One of those to do so, ex-minister Mark Francois, said the draft agreement negotiated by Mrs May with the EU was ""truly awful"" and the prime minister ""just doesn't listen"" to concerns within her party.Ex-Brexit minister Steve Baker told the BBC's Politics Live that although he could not be sure of the number of letters submitted, he believed it was ""close"" to 48 and a contest was ""imminent"". If this happened, he suggested the European Research Group of Brexiteer Tory MPs, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, would ""collectively agree"" which single candidate was best-placed to deliver the Brexit they wanted and back them. But Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mrs May would win any contest ""decisively"" and ""deserved to"" since there was ""no plausible alternative"" to her approach. Rumours had been rife that Mr Gove, a key figure in the 2016 Leave campaign, would follow fellow Brexiteers out of the cabinet in protest at the EU withdrawal agreement.But the environment secretary, who reportedly rejected an offer to make him Brexit secretary after Dominic Raab's exit, told reporters on Friday he was focused on working in cabinet to get ""the right deal in the future"".  Asked if he had confidence in the PM, Mr Gove said: ""I absolutely do.""He added: ""I'm also looking forward to continuing to work with all my government colleagues and all my colleagues in parliament in order to make sure that we get the best future for Britain.""International Trade Secretary Liam Fox told an event in Bristol: ""We are not elected to do what we want to do, but to do what is in the national interest.""Speaking in public for the first time since the withdrawal agreement was signed off by cabinet, Mr Fox said he hopes MPs ""will take a rational and reasonable view"" of the deal.He added: ""I hope across parliament we recognise that a deal is better than no deal, and businesses require certainty - it's in our national interest to provide certainty as soon as possible.""By BBC Assistant Political Editor Norman SmithMichael Gove is not resigning because he thinks that even at this very late hour, he is the person who can make Theresa May change course with Brexit.This is a huge relief for Theresa May, who meanwhile has been carrying on with business as usual by trying to sell her deal.Theresa May has made it absolutely clear that she is going nowhere.Senior placed Tory MPs are saying they have reached the magic 48 letters needed for a vote of confidence against Theresa May, but Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the 1922 committee - is giving precious little away.A Conservative party leadership challenge is most definitely looming, if not this morning or this afternoon, by the weekend.Michael Gove is a bit of a man of mystery, but if he doesn't take the Brexit Secretary role, it begs the question of who would take that job.Mr Gove's decision to stay was a boost for Mrs May, who followed up a defiant Downing Street press conference on Thursday with a live phone-in on Friday morning on LBC radio, during which two callers said she should stand aside.She compared herself to her cricketing hero Geoffrey Boycott who she said had ""kept at the crease and carried on"".Ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingdale is among the latest Tory MP to demand a vote of confidence in the PM while a number of MPs, including Mr Francois and Adam Holloway, publicly tweeted copies of their letter. But this prompted a blistering response from veteran Conservative MP Nicholas Soames.Ambassadors from EU member states also met in Brussels on Friday morning to discuss the agreement. The bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, paid tribute to Mrs May, but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK.BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the consensus from the meeting was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. The government unveiled its long-awaited draft withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, which sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU, over 585 pages.But Mrs May is facing opposition from across the political spectrum to the draft deal, which must be approved by Parliament, with critics saying it will leave the UK indefinitely tied to the EU. It is also understood that a group of cabinet ministers are also considering whether to try to force Mrs May to make some changes to the withdrawal deal."
2018-11-17,Peer's accuser 'bullied' over groping ban,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46234892,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA women's rights campaigner has said she feels ""re-victimised"" after a peer she has accused of sexual harassment was told he would not face immediate suspension from the House of Lords.Jasvinder Sanghera said she felt ""bullied from afar yet again"" after peers voted for the case against Lord Lester to be looked at again.She said it was ""disheartening"" how peers had focused more on procedural issues rather than her allegations.Lord Lester says her claims are untrue.The former Lib Dem peer faced being suspended from the Lords until 2022, the longest ban in parliamentary history, after Ms Sanghera accused him of groping her and offering her a peerage in return for sleeping with him. The Privileges and Conduct Committee, which oversees members' behaviour, said earlier this week that the 82-year-old peer had ""failed to act on his personal honour by sexually harassing the complainant and offering her corrupt inducements to sleep with him"".But when the issue was debated in the Lords on Thursday, peers voted by  by 101 to 78 to send the case back to the committee to look at it again in the interest of ""natural justice and fairness"".Ms Sanghera said the allegations, which date back to 2006, had been upheld three times in the House of Lords and to now be told, in effect, that she was not ""believed"" realised her ""worst fears"". She said peers seemed to be more concerned about Lord Lester's reputation than hers, while those who had spoken out on her behalf had been ""sidelined"". ""Sitting there watching the debate for me personally felt as if I was being subjected to being bullied from afar yet again,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.""I felt re-victimised. It was disheartening to hear members of the House of Lords straining to discuss me as an individual, what I did, what I didn't do. And nobody in that room, actually very few talked about the real issues here, the issues of sexual harassment and bullying.""Ms Sanghera, a campaigner against forced marriage, was not named in the Lords report but waived her anonymity, in an interview with the Times, to encourage other women to speak out about harassment.She told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show that the peers' actions had sent completely the ""wrong message"" to victims of sexual harassment and bullying. She said she would still encourage victims to speak out, but added that she ""cannot advise any person at the moment out there who is a victim of sexual harassment at the hands of a peer to give them confidence to come forward because I would not want them to go through what I went through"". She said the Lords Commissioner for Standards, who carried out the original investigation, had followed the procedures laid down for her by peers and Lord Lester had not objected at any point during the probe. But Lord Lester, a veteran human rights lawyer who worked for several decades on gender equality and race relations, has welcomed the Lords' decision. He thanked peers who supported the amendment tabled by cross-bench peer Lord Pannick for ""recognising the importance of process and now look forward to restoring my reputation"". Lord Pannick argued that the investigation process was ""manifestly unfair"" and that Lord Lester should have had the opportunity to cross-question his accuser if, as he claimed, the commissioner was unwilling to do so. But the decision to refer it back to the committee was criticised by deputy Lords Speaker, the former Labour MP Lord McFall, who said it was ""deeply disappointing"". "
2018-11-17,Ministers in 'denial' over UK poverty,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46236642,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMinisters are in a ""state of denial"" about poverty, a UN expert has said following a 12-day tour of the UK.Philip Alston, special rapporteur on extreme poverty, said despite being in the one of the world's richest countries he had encountered ""misery"".Levels of child poverty are ""staggering"" and 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, the Australian said.The government rejected his analysis, pointing to rising household incomes.Prof Alston, an expert in human rights law based at New York University, visited locations including Belfast, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Essex, Glasgow, London and Newcastle on a fact-finding mission.He met people affected by poverty as well as government officials, discussing the impact of austerity, changes to benefits and local government funding.At a news conference in London, he said he witnessed ""a lot of misery, a lot of people who feel the system is failing them, a lot of people who feel the system is really just there to punish them"".Quoting figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, he said that more than 1.5 million people were destitute at some point in 2017, meaning they lived on less than £70 a week or went without essentials such as housing, food, clothing or heating.A fifth of the population, amounting to 14 million people, are living in poverty, Prof Alston said.Prof Alston used a new measure by the Social Metrics Commission to come up with the figure of 14m people in the UK in poverty.It is a measure of ""relative poverty"", meaning it looks at the percentage of people living with less than 55% of the median income, taking into account costs such as childcare, housing, debt and disability.But the government has preferred to use the measure of ""absolute poverty"".This counts the number of people in households with less than 60% of the median income as it was in 2010/11, so it shows how living standards of low-income households have changed over time.By that measure, the government says there are a million fewer people in absolute poverty than there were in 2010.Among experts in the media, think tanks, Parliament and organisations such as the National Audit Office, Prof Alston said there was ""close to unanimity"" that Britain was not doing enough to combat poverty.But he said the view from ministers was the opposite. ""Ministers with whom I met told me that things are going well that they don't see any big problems and they are happy with the way their policies are playing out,"" Prof Alston said.He said the government was preoccupied with reducing welfare dependency but said he could not believe ministers were as happy with the results as they claimed to be.Prof Alston said: ""The era of connectivity and the era of social media makes it much less sustainable to have this dramatic difference between people living the high life, a higher life than has ever been lived before, and at the other end, people who can't afford a tin of beans, can't afford the seventh meal of the week.""by Michael Buchanan, BBC social affairs correspondentBritain's poorest communities often feel ignored, that politicians aren't interested in their experiences. For a UN representative to hold public meetings, to seek out their concerns, mattered.Some of the gatherings were packed - hundreds of people took the opportunity to be heard.What emerged for Philip Alston was an astounding disconnect between what he heard at those meetings, backed by other research he'd done, and the discussions he held with the ministers who oversee the very system causing such hardship for many people.Some will ask why the UN is looking at poverty in the UK - one of the world's richest nations. The answer, said Prof Alston, is that the government has supported these UN investigations in other countries, and couldn't therefore oppose the legitimacy of his visit here.These harsh criticisms of the government's approach to the poor may not make their lives better immediately. But their daily struggles have appalled the UN, and in time, that might matter.The approach to benefits was ""punitive, mean-spirited, and often callous"", Prof Alston said. He gave the example of ""draconian sanctions"" which shut people out from the benefits system for weeks or months at a time, sometimes for minor infringements such as missing an appointment.Many of the ""harsh"" policies could be ended ""overnight"" at little cost, he claimed.These included the delay of five to 12 weeks before Universal Credit was paid, the single household payments which give more leverage to controlling or violent partners, and the two-child limit for benefit claimants.Prof Alston compared this limit to China's notorious one-child policy and said it was ""a perfect way to punish families"".Welfare changes have disproportionately affected women, especially single parents, he said.""If you got a group of misogynists in a room, and said guys, how can we make this system work for men and not for women, they wouldn't have come up with too many other ideas than what's already in place.""He also warned that the poor would ""bear the brunt"" of the expected impact of Brexit on the UK economy, and said the fall in the value of the pound had already cost low-income families £400 a year.""In my meetings with the government, it was clear to me that the impact of Brexit on people in poverty is an afterthought,"" he said.Prof Alston's report will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva next year.A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We completely disagree with this analysis.""She said that household incomes have ""never been higher"", income inequality has fallen and there are one million fewer people living in absolute poverty compared with 2010.It is not the first time the UK has been criticised by UN special rapporteurs, who are independent human rights experts appointed for fact-finding and monitoring missions around the world.In 2014, urban planning expert Raquel Rolnik said the ""bedroom tax"", which meant social housing tenants with spare rooms had to pay more rent or move somewhere smaller, undermined the right to adequate housing.On that occasion, ministers said her report was a ""misleading Marxist diatribe"" and made an official complaint to the UN."
2018-11-17,What do May's Tory enemies object to?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46214526,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May's draft Brexit agreement has left some of her fellow Conservative MPs seething. There's a broad range of objection, but these are some of their key complaints.For the Brexit faithful, it all comes down to control. Esther McVey, one of two senior members of the UK government to quit because of the proposed deal, did so because it fails to ""regain control"" from Brussels.""Repeatedly you have said that we must regain control of our money, our borders and our laws and develop our own independent trade policy... This deal fails to do this,"" she wrote.Her claim directly contrasts with what Theresa May said on Thursday: ""This deal... brings back control of our money, laws and borders, ends free movement, protects jobs, security and our Union.""So what exactly are the objections and how does the government defend them?This year the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net £10.8bn. It has agreed to continue paying similar amounts until the end of the ""transition period"" - the time after Brexit Day on 29 March 2019 that both sides have set aside to agree a trade deal. The payments will form part of the ""divorce settlement"" - expected to be at least £39bn - which the UK has agreed to pay the EU to cover its financial obligations for leaving.The transition period is due to end on the last day of December 2020, but it may not. The draft agreement leaves the option of it being extended - if a trade deal isn't sorted out. If the transition is extended, it can only happen once and for a limited period.This means a previous commitment by Theresa May that any extension would be for a ""matter of months"", cannot be guaranteed, especially as the decision to extend the transition has to be taken jointly by the EU and the UK.So if the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU which will be agreed separately.However, supporters of the draft deal say once the UK leaves the transition period, its big annual payments will end. This is why the prime minister and her supporters claim the agreement allows the UK to regain control of its money.During the transition period, freedom of movement rules apply, meaning EU citizens will be free to live and work in the UK and vice versa.Once the UK exits transition, it will be able to set its own rules on immigration.This is why the prime minster claims the UK will be ""taking back control"" of its borders and that the country will be ending free movement.But if the transition period continues, so EU citizens will be able to carry on moving to the UK.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is the gremlin here for many Brexit believers. It has the final say on disputes between people and governments on matters of EU law. Its opponents say the last word should always be with a UK court.Mrs May agrees. Two years ago she declared: ""We are not leaving [the EU] only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. That is not going to happen.""But during the transition, the UK will have to follow all EU rules and abide by ECJ rulings.Opponents argue this leaves the UK as a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. And if the transition period is extended into a backstop, the ECJ's jurisdiction will also be extended.But Mrs May's backers say the UK will be free of the ECJ once the transition is over. Another objection, voiced by MP Mark Francois, is that under the agreement the UK has committed to keeping ""equivalent standards"" with the EU in employment, environmental and social policy. In effect, the UK ""would continue to take EU law"" says Mr Francois. Furthermore, if the backstop is triggered then disputes about putting the agreement into practice will be settled by an arbitration panel, consisting of people nominated by both sides. That panel must refer any matter which concerns the interpretation of EU law to the ECJOnce the UK exits transition, and assuming the backstop isn't triggered, it will be able to implement any agreed free trade deals it strikes with other countries.If the transition period is extended, that is the backstop is introduced, free trade deals will have to wait.And if the UK becomes a single customs territory, which is what would happen under the backstop, it won't be able to implement any deals on goods (but it will be able to do some deals it reaches on services).Deciding when the backstop comes to an end, will not only be up to the UK. It will also have to be agreed with the EU. Ms McVey and likeminded enemies of the deal fear the UK could become ""trapped"" in this arrangement, limiting its ability to strike trade deals.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-11-17,"No Brexit renegotiation, EU leaders warn",https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46228454,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU leaders have dismissed talk of renegotiating the draft Brexit deal and warned the UK's political situation could make a ""no-deal"" more likely.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was ""no question"" of reopening talks as a document was ""on the table"". Meanwhile French PM Edouard Philippe said there was a need to prepare for a no-deal because of UK ""uncertainty"".The EU has set out a series of meetings leading up to 25 November when it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.However leaders admit that there is still much ground to cover after the UK Prime Minister Theresa May won backing on Wednesday from her cabinet for the 585-page draft agreement. ""We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides,"" the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said.On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said she was pleased that progress had been made. But following news of resignations from Mrs May's cabinet, including the UK's Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, she said it was possible that Britain may still leave without a deal.She also said that there was no appetite for further talks on possible amendments to the current agreement. ""We have a document on the table that Britain and the EU 27 have agreed to, so for me there is no question at the moment whether we negotiate further,"" she said. Mr Philippe appeared to echo her sentiment over UK political uncertainty. ""It will escape no-one that the current political situation in Britain could fuel uncertainty... over the ratification of the accord,"" he said. The European Parliament's Brexit chief Guy Verhofstadt said the deal had been hammered out after two years of ""intense negotiations"" and he hoped UK MPs would accept that ""there is not a lot of room [for] manoeuvre to say, 'OK, let's start again'"".French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the deal was ""good news for the French economy"" but also issued caution, saying the UK must be made to respect all EU rules.Analysis by BBC Europe editor, Katya AdlerThe EU knows there is a very real possibility the Brexit deal could be voted down by the UK Parliament in a few weeks' time.I put the question to Michel Barnier on Wednesday night at his press conference - but, skilled politician that he is, he refused to engage.Brussels is very keen indeed not to give the impression that the EU might change or come up with a ""better"" Brexit deal text if this one ends up being rejected in the House of Commons.Mr Barnier quoted Theresa May as saying that this is a deal in the UK's interest.Finland's Prime Minister Juha Sipila tweeted to say that while Wednesday's developments were important, ""decisions on both sides are still needed for a final agreement"".Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he was ""very pleased"" and ""optimistic"", adding: ""We are pinning our hopes on it.""Speaking on Thursday alongside EU Council head Donald Tusk, Mr Barnier said the agreement was fair and balanced, took into account the UK's needs and laid the ground for an ""ambitious new partnership"".Mr Tusk praised Mr Barnier's work and said the agreement had ""secured the interests of the 27 member states and EU as a whole"".He laid out the timetable for the days ahead.Mr Tusk said: ""Since the very beginning, we have had no doubt that Brexit is a lose-lose situation, and that our negotiations are only about damage control.""Addressing the UK, he added: ""As much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, for you and for us.""Mr Barnier later took the document to the European Parliament. Its president, Antonio Tajani, said MEPs would vote on the deal in early 2019.If the agreement is approved by both sides, a 21-month transition period will kick in, during which a trade deal and the thorny issue of how to ensure there is no physical border between Northern Ireland - part of the UK - and the Republic of Ireland will need to be worked out.A smooth border-free exchange underpins the peace deal that ended the Northern Ireland conflict."

Maybe I should just stop there. It is Friday night after all, and after the Big Dipper ride of the last few days, maybe for Number 10, and maybe for you, that's enough to be going on with for now. But Number 10 knows they'd be kidding themselves to imagine that the danger has gone. We simply won't know, probably until Monday, whether there are enough Tory MPs willing to put their names to letters calling for her to go to trigger a vote on confidence in her that might - in theory - force her from office. It is possible that by the start of next week Theresa May finds herself with a vote that could unseat her.If she doesn't, or even if she does but then wins such a vote, here's the problem.More than 20 MPs have put their names out there publicly calling on her to go and screaming protests at her Brexit deal. They might not get their confidence vote. Even if they do, they might not get enough support to oust her.But it seems impossible for those who have put their names out there to vote for the Brexit deal in a few weeks time. With the DUP bristling with rage about the deal and how it was arrived at, and very little sign of a cavalry of Labour MPs riding to the rescue, the number of public protests from those Tory MPs makes it seem like Theresa May's agreement is doomed.In that regard, how on earth does the government plan to get it through? Can they?There are two factors that Number 10 hopes will come through for them. First off, they hope that once the deal is done officially with the EU, next Sunday (25 November), then the dynamic will change. Something along the lines of the leaked plan to sell the deal that we saw last week can get going, and when it does, expect it to rev up fast and loud.As we've discussed before plenty of times, the government machine will crank up fast and furiously to get MPs to back the deal - or else.And they also hope that more Labour MPs than currently expected will back them in the end. That's not just because they could choose a deal rather than open Pandora's box. But it's also because there's a belief in Number 10 that Labour's fellow politicians on the left around Europe will make it clear that frankly, this deal is the best the UK will get, and that a hypothetical Labour government couldn't and wouldn't do any better. Is that realistic, when the opposition party have the temptation of doing maximum damage to the government of the day? Let's see.For some of the government's critics, it's simply deluded to imagine they will be able to turn this debate around. The draft deal, only 48 hours after it was published, has been roundly attacked. There are many more MPs on the record now than are needed to defeat the agreement in Parliament. But it is impossible to be in the minds of the MPs contemplating turning in a letter calling for May to quit over the weekend.And harder still to be in the minds of those who will have an agonising choice if the deal makes it to the Commons in a few weeks time.It is calmer in Westminster tonight, but it is messy, and the danger hasn't gone away. "
2018-11-17,Number crunching,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46239782,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit deal which has been negotiated by the UK and the EU is expected to be agreed at a special EU summit on 25 November.After that, MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"".Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 51 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. Then there are, perhaps, a further 14 Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."

But how could this happen?Each party has its own rules for selecting a leader. Under the Conservatives' system, there are two ways to trigger a leadership contest.One, unsurprisingly, is if the leader resigns. The other is if 15% of Conservative MPs write letters saying they no longer have confidence in her.These letters have to be sent to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, which is made up of all backbench Conservative MPs.The 1922 Committee chairman - who is currently an MP called Graham Brady - does not reveal how many letters he has received until it reaches the 15% mark, which means 48 letters would have to be received.This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs that could happen as soon as the next day. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year.But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.The 1922 Committee sets the timetable for the contest.Tory MPs then choose two candidates to present to a vote of the wider membership of the party.If necessary, they whittle the field down to two with a series of ballots where the lowest-ranking person is eliminated after each round.Then it is time for the party members to vote for the winner. The two candidates would be expected to take part in debates to put their cases forward to members before the final voting deadline.If there is only one candidate, that person becomes leader with no need for a vote from members.Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister."

2018-11-17,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-17,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181117230917/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

2018-11-18,May: Ousting me won't help Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46250607,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has told her critics that getting rid of her as PM would not make delivering Brexit any easier.Mrs May defended last week's draft agreement for leaving the EU and said there was a ""critical"" week ahead.She suggested agreeing more details of UK's future relationship with the EU, ahead of an expected summit next week, could satisfy the concerns of some of the Tory MPs opposed to her plans.Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was being ""bullied"" by the EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party could get a better deal in time for Brexit, which is due to happen on 29 March.There has been widespread criticism of the 585-page withdrawal agreement - published alongside a  shorter document setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which is set be signed off at a summit next week.There is also doubt over whether it can win the approval of the House of Commons.Some cabinet ministers have resigned, including Mr Raab, and others are believed to be trying to change its wording.In other developments:Mrs May told Sky News's Ridge on Sunday it had been a ""tough week"" but that she would not be distracted. She added the next seven days ""are going to be critical"" for the UK's future.Asked whether Sir Graham Brady - chairman of the backbench 1922 committee - had received the 48 letters needed to trigger a confidence vote in her leadership, she replied: ""As far as I know, no - it has not.""And in a warning to those pushing for a change of leader, she said: ""It is not going to make the negotiations any easier and it won't change the parliamentary arithmetic.""Mrs May said negotiations were still taking place to put more detail into the future deal proposals, saying it was this part that ""delivers on the Brexit vote"".She also said she would be meeting European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels ahead of the summit.BBC Europe editor Katya AdlerThe European Commission says Mrs May will only meet Mr Juncker when concrete progress has been made on the content of the political declaration document on the future relationship.Those negotiations have been going on this weekend and had been expected to conclude on Tuesday - let's see.EU sources are clearly spelling out that the PM's visit would be to finalise this political declaration - and not to re-open the withdrawal deal approved last week by the cabinet.Despite the political turmoil in the UK, the EU intends the Brexit summit between EU leaders and the PM to go ahead next Sunday unless she is kicked out of her job, or she suddenly politically denounces the divorce deal she has been trying to sell.Don't forget - the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding. The political declaration on the future will not. It can be altered after Brexit, because it is only then that the detailed EU-UK negotiations on a future trade deal begin in earnest.EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has been meeting diplomats from the 27 remaining EU member states.The EU has now proposed 31 December 2022 as the ultimate end date for a possible extension to the transition period.This period, during which the UK will have left but arrangements will largely continue as they are, is currently forecast to finish by the end of 2020.The draft withdrawal agreement includes the option of extending it if more time is needed to reach a trade deal - but rather than specifying an end date, says a decision may be taken ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX].""Also in the meeting there was a divide between states that want an ambitious trading relationship with the UK and those who want Britain's access to the single market to be more constrained, BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said.The UK wants to maintain the status quo on internal security, which is also ""a problem,"" ambassadors were told. And Spain raised serious concerns about Gibraltar, which officials fear could grow in the coming days, he added.A diplomat said the message from the EU's Brexit negotiators to the member states was: ""Keep a lid on your concerns for now and we'll deal with them in the negotiations on the future relationship.""Sir Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics he would not reveal how many letters he had received - saying he had not even told his wife, who is his parliamentary assistant.""I get asked in the supermarket, in the street,"" he said.Sir Graham said he found the suggestion he had received 48 letters but not acted on it to be ""slightly offensive"".""It's critical that people trust my integrity in this,"" he said.Sir Graham also told the BBC's Sunday Politics North West it was ""very likely"" Mrs May would win a vote of no-confidence if there was one.It is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit could go ahead if Mrs May were to lose a confidence vote next week.It is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote would be held, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.If Mrs May were to lose that confidence vote it would spark a leadership election but she would not be allowed to run. She would remain prime minister until the contest was over unless she opted to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.In either circumstance, her version of Brexit would be in doubt.European Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something ""extraordinary"" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.Mr Raab, who negotiated with the EU's Michel Barnier, explained his decision to quit on the BBC's Andrew Marr show.With ""two or three points"" being changed he could support the government's proposals, he said.He said he did not know who had inserted a clause on customs relations into the future partnership document but said it was a ""clear breach"" of the Conservative manifesto.""The difficulty for me is that I was being asked to go over to Brussels and sign on the bottom line... on a deal which I said in good conscience I did not feel was right for the country,"" he said.""I do think we are being bullied, I do think we are being subjected to what is pretty close to blackmail frankly.""I do think there is a point at which, we probably should have done it before, where we just say 'I'm sorry this is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we cannot accept those dictated terms'.""The draft document sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights.  Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to include in the deal a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this.This would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable.And the UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Brexiteer MP Zac Goldsmith said under the PM's plan ""in effect, Britain would remain in the EU, but without having any say"".He added: ""Had that been the choice, I personally would have voted to remain.""Labour leader Mr Corbyn says his party, which has 257 MPs, will not support the deal.He told Sky News the ""one-way agreement"" on Northern Ireland was ""not acceptable"", and there were no guarantees on workers' rights and environmental protections.If it was voted down in the Commons, he said the government should go back to the EU and ""renegotiate, rapidly"".Mr Corbyn insisted Labour would be able to negotiate a better deal, saying the proposed transition period - which will only happen if there is a withdrawal agreement - offered ""some opportunities"" for this.He also said another referendum - as demanded by some of his MPs - was ""an option for the future but not an option for today"".He said he voted Remain in the 2016 referendum but if there were to be another ""I don't know how I would vote - what the options would be at that time"".He also revealed that he had not yet read all of the 585 page draft EU withdrawal agreement."

2018-11-18,Brexit plan can be improved - Leadsom,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46243745,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere is ""still the potential to improve"" the draft Brexit deal, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom has said.While she backed Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to get the ""best possible deal"", she warned the UK could not be ""trapped"" in an EU customs union.The BBC understands that Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom is part of a group of five ministers hoping to amend the deal.Despite widespread criticism of the draft withdrawal agreement, Mrs May has vowed to ""see it through"".The 585-page document sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including details such as how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period and citizens' rights. It is due to be finalised at an EU summit next Sunday, 25 November.The publication of the draft text prompted the start of a tumultuous few days for Mrs May, with two senior ministers and several other junior ministers and aides resigning.Some Conservative Brexiteers who are unhappy with the agreement have also been submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May. If 48 letters are sent, then a vote will be triggered and she could face a challenge to her leadership.Mark Francois, one of the 21 Conservative MPs who have publicly said they have sent a letter, said Mrs May's plan would leave the UK ""half in and half out"" of the EU and everyone knew she would never get it through Parliament.But Conservative MP Sir Alan Duncan urged his other fellow MPs to ""stop and reflect"", saying a leadership challenge was not going to get the country a better deal than Mrs May's.""All it's likely to do is create chaos, break the government, break the party and leave the country in great disarray.""If there were to be a confidence vote in Mrs May's leadership, party veteran Ken Clarke said she would ""easily"" win it but Nadine Dorries was doubtful, saying ""when pen comes to paper"" most MPs would vote against her in a secret ballot.By Susana Mendonça, BBC political correspondentWhen they didn't jump ship over Theresa May's Brexit deal you might have thought that meant these key Brexiteers in her cabinet were ready to toe the line in a show of what's supposed to be known as ""collective responsibility"". But the fact that they're still manoeuvring to change the details of the prime minister's deal (while declaring their support for her), is yet another sign of the extraordinary political times we are in. This apparent gang of five inside the cabinet differ in their priorities. Andrea Leadsom - who's understood to be leading them - doesn't want Britain to be trapped in an endless backstop, and wants technological solutions to get around it. Environment Secretary Michael Gove is worried about treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The group is at an ""embryonic"" stage but will they get their tweaks?Andrea Leadsom thinks there's ""still more to be done"" and that they ""do still have more time"" before the EU Council at the end of the month. But that leaves only just over a week - and the EU doesn't look to be in the market for renegotiation at the moment.On Friday evening, it emerged that Mrs Leadsom hopes to work with the four other cabinet ministers to change the draft withdrawal deal into something ""winnable and supportable"".The four ministers believed to working with Mrs Leadsom are Michael Gove and Liam Fox - who on Friday publicly threw their support behind the PM - plus Penny Mordaunt and Chris Grayling.Speaking to the BBC in her constituency, Mrs Leadsom said: ""What I'm doing is working very hard to support the prime minister in getting the Brexit deal that 17.4 million people voted for.""I think there's still the potential to improve on the clarification and on some of the measures within it and that's what I'm hoping to be able to help with.""Among her concerns was that ""the UK cannot be trapped in a permanent customs arrangement"" with the EU, she said.She added: ""I wouldn't describe myself as a plotter. I'm really just trying to make sure that we get the best possible Brexit deal.""The cabinet ""gang of five"" specifically want to change the part regarding the Irish backstop - which has been one of the main sticking points in talks with Brussels.Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border so they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - or back-up plan - in case they cannot reach a long-term trade agreement which does this. The backstop would mean that Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards than the rest of the UK, which critics say is unacceptable. The UK would not be able to leave the backstop without the EU's consent.According to the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the group of ministers want a change in the draft text to include the possibility of new technology or a free trade deal as alternative solutions to the Irish border issue. The group's plans were described as a ""work in progress"", and a ""last-ditch attempt to find something to put to the Commons"".The deal is expected to be approved at a special EU summit on 25 November, before being voted on by MPs in Parliament.Ahead of the vote, the EU is saying it intends to stick to the existing text, according to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. If it is voted down, the EU would be open to ""tweaks"" but a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron has said ""nothing fundamental"" could change.Our correspondent adds that if it came to a general election or another referendum, the EU would likely be open to putting the leaving process on ice to avoid a no-deal Brexit and in the hope the UK might change its mind and stay in the EU.The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the EU should not enter ""some kind of bargaining process"" over parts of the text, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted the EU and the UK had agreed the text so negotiations should not continue.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested that Labour could renegotiate the deal before the UK is due to leave the EU in March next year.""I think we can do it with good will, we can change the atmosphere of negotiations into one of mutual interest and mutual benefit,"" he told Sky News.Meanwhile, the prime minister told the Daily Mail the withdrawal agreement was ""not everybody's ideal deal"" but said her job was to make ""tough decisions"" and ""find a way through"".She also warned her opponents their alternative Brexit plans would not resolve the Irish backstop issue.Commenting on the backlash to the deal, Mrs May acknowledged it had been ""a pretty heavy couple of days"".She revealed her husband Philip, who she described as her ""rock"", had helped her through it - at one point pouring her a whisky and making beans on toast. On Friday night, Mrs May called dozens of constituency chairmen to appeal to them to back her deal and her leadership - and this weekend she is expected to embark on a ""social media blitz"" to try to sell her plans to people not usually engaged in politics. Mrs May's comments come after Stephen Barclay was picked as the new Brexit secretary - replacing Dominic Raab who quit on Thursday. A No 10 spokesman indicated that Mr Barclay, who becomes the third Brexit secretary since the role was created, would focus on domestic preparations for Brexit, rather than the negotiations.In other developments:The draft withdrawal agreement for Brexit that Mrs May agreed with her cabinet on Wednesday has been signed off by negotiators from both the UK and EU.

We don't believe it serves the interest of this country, therefore the government have to go back to the EU and renegotiate rapidly.""Mr Corbyn said Labour would focus on negotiating a permanent customs arrangement with the EU, otherwise the UK would ""lose on jobs, lose on investment and we lose on future economic development"".But he admitted he had not read all 585 pages of the draft withdrawal agreement, saying: ""I've read a lot of it.""On the same programme, Mrs May said further negotiations with the EU were taking place but that MPs should ensure ""we deliver what people in this country voted on"".She warned rivals thinking of replacing her as Conservative leader: ""It is not going to make the negotiations any easier and it won't change the parliamentary arithmetic."""
2018-11-18,The withdrawal agreement - what it all means,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46237012,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues. Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.   Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

She said: ""The withdrawal agreement has lots of flaws within it, and fundamentally, there is no clarity whatsoever about the future between the UK and the EU.""The House of Commons is going to be asked to effectively endorse a 'blindfold Brexit', where all the difficult issues that have dogged these negotiations for two-and-a-half years are simply kicked further down the road.""I think it would be a mistake and deeply irresponsible for the House of Commons to endorse that.""The SNP leader said it was not enough for people to say what they reject and that there was now a need for ""calm heads and clear thinking"".She wants to see those who reject the deal to come forward with alternatives.She outlined two ways forward - for the House of Commons to coalesce behind a plan to keep the UK within the single market and the customs union, and the option of a second vote.She told Andrew Marr: ""Whatever people voted for in 2016, they did not vote for the chaos that is prevailing now.""Ms Sturgeon revealed plans to go to London in the coming week and to engage with opposition parties - including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - on a plan for a ""clear alternative"".The MSP also responded to claims from Scottish Secretary David Mundell that she was attempting to increase support for Scottish independence by using Northern Ireland's troubled past.Speaking to Scottish Conservatives in Falkirk on Saturday he backed the prime minister, insisting the alternatives to the proposed exit deal were ""even more unpalatable"" and calling Nicola Sturgeon's criticisms of the deal ""opportunistic"".But Ms Sturgeon denied this stance. She said on Sunday: ""While I absolutely support whatever arrangements it takes to preserve peace and the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, that would put Scotland at a real disadvantage which is another reason why I couldn't support it.""Other Scottish Conservatives have expressed caution over backing the draft agreement. Speaking to the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, the Tory MP for Angus, Kirstene Hair, said there were reassurances she needed before committing to vote in favour of the agreement.She is looking for more information from London on fishing and the backstop.She said: ""It is only right MPs, who are essentially making one of the biggest decisions they will ever make as an MP outwith deciding going to war, must take the time to get the detail of this deal correct and be reassured we can indeed vote for it.""It is quite irresponsible of people to come to a decision within almost minutes or hours of that deal being released because what we need to do is look through it line-by-line to ensure we are happy with it because this is the biggest decision we will make as members of parliament.""Labour Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird stuck to the Labour stance agreed at its annual conference.She said: ""The deal on the table is absolutely a broken deal and it has no consensus. It will not get through parliament. ""At this juncture we need to take the parliamentary procedures and use that towards a meaningful vote. We need to build a consensus on what is the way forward.""All options must remain on the table. We are in the situation we are in now because the conservatives have taken all the options off the table from the outset.""We've seen the deal. Now we must start to find what the plan is. Theresa May should now go back to Europe and say we can't get this through parliament. She needs to start renegotiating the deal."""

We believe there is a new agenda needed for Northern Ireland politics.""We are engaged in discussions with the SDLP in terms of the shape and nature of that new agenda but we are in a process at the moment.""He added: ""I am not going to breach that particular process, but we have exchanged documents and we are looking at how we can deepen that relationship between the two parties.""I know where we are heading but I have due regard for my partners in this discussion, the SDLP.""In October Fianna Fáil headquarters were at loggerheads with some senior members of the party after they appeared  to announce a Fianna Fáil candidate in Northern Ireland.At a meeting in Omagh, County Tyrone, it was announced that councillor Sorcha McAnespy would be standing as a candidate in Northern Ireland's local council elections.But Fianna Fáil headquarters issued a statement reiterating that the party had made ""no decision"" on contesting the election.Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly was at the event in Omagh and was named as Ms McAnespy's campaign manager. He was subsequently sacked as the party's deputy Seanad (Irish senate) leader and spokesperson for foreign affairs.Fianna Fáil said that the party had made no decisions around contesting elections because it was continuing talks with the SDLP.  Some SDLP members have said they oppose the merger, including South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna who previously told the BBC she would not join Fianna Fail.Mr Martin said he understood those concerns.""I am very conscious of that, and equally we have many people from the SDLP coming to us, wishing for us to engage with them as well.""Of course Fianna Fail has a strong social democratic tradition as well of its own.""These are issues that have to be teased out and obviously the SDLP members themselves will have to have a discussion and that is a matter for the SDLP to have that discussion as well.""Mr Martin, who has led Fianna Fail since 2011 and is a former foreign minister, suggested any candidates elected in a deal between the parties would take their seats.""Our view is that people who don't want to take their seats - so Sinn Fein at the moment don't want to take their seats - stand aside and let those who do, run.""There is a very simple way around it.

In her first interview in her new job, Ms Rudd called on any colleagues planning to submit letters of no-confidence in Mrs May to ""think again"".""This is not a time for changing our leader,"" she said.""This is a time for pulling together, for making sure we remember who we are here to serve, who we are here to help: that's the whole of the country.""Stephen Hammond will take over from Mr Barclay at the department for health and social care.The government also announced replacements for two junior ministers who resigned over Mrs May's deal.

Around 20 Tory MPs have publicly called for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister, with more thought to have written to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee to call for a vote on her leadership.

2018-11-18,MP's aide gives evidence against her,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-46236527,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe former aide of a Labour MP accused of lying to avoid a speeding ticket said he felt ""morally and legally"" obliged to give evidence against her.Dr Christian DeFeo said he contacted police after seeing a news report of Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya's trial at the Old Bailey.Fiona Onasanya claimed a Russian man was behind the wheel when her car was clocked doing 41mph in a 30mph zone.The 35-year-old denies one count of perverting the course of justice.The prosecution has claimed Ms Onasanya and her brother Festus Onasanya ""acted jointly in telling lies"" to claim she was not driving her Nissan Micra when it was clocked by a speed camera in July 2017, a week after she was elected as an MP. Dr DeFeo told the court he had ""enormous hopes invested"" in the Labour MP, continuing: ""I never dreamed in my darkest dreams - I never thought I would have to be sitting here [giving evidence].""It is with the greatest reluctance I have to do this.""To do otherwise, I cannot. It's morally and legally unacceptable not to.""The MP's former campaigns and communications manager said she visited his house on 24 July and spent no less than two hours discussing the ""nitty gritty"" of a charity lease. He said he could not give a specific time but said it had been ""quite late"" and she had arrived in her car alone. The court has heard Ms Onasanya was sent a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) after her car was clocked in Thorney, near Peterborough, at 22:03 BST on 24 July.She returned the paperwork naming the driver as Aleks Antipow, a previous tenant of a property the siblings rented out in Cambridge. The jury heard he was in Russia at the time of the incident had had never driven the MP's car. On 5 November, Mr Onasanya, 33, of Chesterton, Cambridge, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to three counts of perverting the course of justice.The trial continues."
2018-11-18,How could May turmoil affect Brexit?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46233813,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has vowed to see her Brexit deal through, but as this week's events have shown, a lot can change in politics - and fast. Here are the possible scenarios of her next move and what it could mean for the future of Brexit. The prime minister managed to get her draft withdrawal agreement through cabinet on Wednesday, only to see two members resign in protest at it the following day.Some had expected further walkouts but Michael Gove and Liam Fox, both prominent Brexiteers, have rallied behind her. The threat of a no-confidence vote from Tory MPs remains, but if she does stay on office - and her defiant performance at a Downing Street press conference and on an LBC radio phone-in suggests she is not going anywhere - can she stay on course with her deal?First up will be the emergency EU summit on 25 November where the UK and 27 EU member states will meet to sign off on the withdrawal agreement.The noises from the continent have been positive, with Germany's Angela Merkel saying she was pleased with the progress and France's Finance Minister saying the deal was ""good news for the French economy"".EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier paid tribute to Theresa May at a meeting of member states' ambassadors in Brussels this morning but said that the EU had to protect its principles even if there were political problems in the UK.The consensus, according to our man in Brussels, Adam Fleming, was that the EU should keep calm and not provoke the situation in the UK. But officials point out that European Council President Donald Tusk has left the door open to the 25 November summit being cancelled if something ""extraordinary"" happens.Diplomats' lives in Brussels are now a combination of missed meals, late nights, meetings and speculation about the state of the British government, says Adam Fleming, who is on a similar schedule.Katya Adler: EU determined to keep calm and carry on with Brexit dealWhile the determination of Mrs May makes this scenario seem unlikely, it is possible that with continuing criticism from her own party, and perhaps more resignations in the offing, the PM could throw in the towel. If she leaves No 10 over the issue of her withdrawal agreement, the UK could then change direction entirely over its exit from the European Union. Brexiteers like David Davis and Jacob-Rees Mogg want to go back to Brussels and renegotiate - something EU leaders have made clear they are not open to. Others, like pro-Remain Tory Anna Soubry, have suggested a government of national unity, seeing a coalition of MPs from all sides come together to get us through - a concept normally associated with times of war. But again, Mrs May has made clear her intention is to stick it out. This scenario would make the PM's fighting spirit null and void. If the Conservative Party wants to oust her, MPs have to write letters to the chair of the 1922 Committee - made up of backbenchers - saying they have no confidence in her. If the chair, Sir Graham Brady, gets 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of Tory MPs - a vote of confidence is triggered and a secret ballot takes place. If Mrs May wins, she becomes immune from another challenge for a year. But if she loses, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.It is a risk for Brexiteers, who would face the prospect of trying to persuade Mrs May to change course on Brexit for another 12 months. But if the party votes against her, it becomes a battle between its two opposing wings, and the direction of Brexit could be determined by which side comes out on top.It is difficult to see how the 25 November EU summit to sign off on the deal could go ahead if Theresa May loses a confidence vote in the next few days.It is up to Sir Graham to decide when such a vote will be held, once he has received the required 48 letters from Tory MPs demanding one, but he has said the process will move quickly. The last time a Tory leader was ousted by their own MPs, in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith faced a confidence vote the next day.If Mrs May loses she will continue to be prime minister until the leadership contest is over but she won't be allowed to take part in it.She could opt to resign and hand over to a caretaker prime minister.In either circumstance, her version of Brexit, as set out in the withdrawal agreement and future relationship document, would be in doubt.European Council President Donald Tusk has said the summit will go ahead unless something ""extraordinary"" happens - he did not elaborate on what that might be.Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor who currently holds the revolving EU presidency, told Die Presse: ""The next week will be intense, because of course it will be crucial if there is a majority for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister May. In any case, as the EU Presidency, we have made all the preparations to move forward swiftly."" So let's say she survives the attempts of her own colleagues to oust her and gets her deal signed off in Brussels - then there is the small matter of the ""meaningful vote"" promised to MPs.As things stand, with dissent from her own backbenchers, anger from her partners in the DUP, and Labour and the rest of the opposition lined up to vote against it, the numbers do not add up to getting her withdrawal agreement through.  There is rumoured pressure for her to allow a free vote of all Conservative MPs - a highly unusual move which would involve suspending collective cabinet responsibility.Her predecessor David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign for Leave or Remain as they saw fit during the referendum - but a vote in the Commons is a different matter.Downing Street has said there will be no free vote.And if the past three days are anything to go by, the PM will continue to hammer home her message that the public wants Parliament to ""get on with it"" and hope that is enough to win MPs over. She will try to present MPs with a take-it-or-leave-it choice between her deal or no deal in the hope enough waverers will be frightened into backing her.Labour will be using every weapon in their Parliamentary armoury to ensure other options are put to the vote.If MPs do reject the deal we are into full scale constitutional crisis territory. Britain would still be on course to leave the EU on 29 March - it's the law - but all sorts of possibilities come into play that could cause delays and renegotiations.It would be one way out of her bind if the deal is voted down, but the PM has repeatedly ruled out going back to the public to ask for their say on the deal, and her Leave-supporting critics feel the same way. Prominent pro-Remainers from both sides of the House - including Tory Dominic Grieve and Labour's Chuka Umunna - alongside the Lib Dems and Greens and a growing public campaign for a ""people's vote"" think differently.But unless Mrs May performs a shocking U-turn, or there is a new prime minister, it would be down to Parliamentary manouvering to get a vote on it, which might not pass, although Labour has not ruled out backing a referendum.Time is also running out to hold a campaign before Brexit day, so Article 50 might have to be extended, something Brussels might agree to, but a lot would depend on the proposed question on the ballot paper.This is Labour's preferred outcome. It they win they would have to ask for an extension to Article 50 to give them a chance to go to Brussels and negotiate their version of Brexit.Mrs May is unlikely to be keen on trying to get backing for another election, given her experiences last year, but in the current climate it feels like almost anything is possible."

Maybe I should just stop there. It is Friday night after all, and after the Big Dipper ride of the last few days, maybe for Number 10, and maybe for you, that's enough to be going on with for now. But Number 10 knows they'd be kidding themselves to imagine that the danger has gone. We simply won't know, probably until Monday, whether there are enough Tory MPs willing to put their names to letters calling for her to go to trigger a vote on confidence in her that might - in theory - force her from office. It is possible that by the start of next week Theresa May finds herself with a vote that could unseat her.If she doesn't, or even if she does but then wins such a vote, here's the problem.More than 20 MPs have put their names out there publicly calling on her to go and screaming protests at her Brexit deal. They might not get their confidence vote. Even if they do, they might not get enough support to oust her.But it seems impossible for those who have put their names out there to vote for the Brexit deal in a few weeks time. With the DUP bristling with rage about the deal and how it was arrived at, and very little sign of a cavalry of Labour MPs riding to the rescue, the number of public protests from those Tory MPs makes it seem like Theresa May's agreement is doomed.In that regard, how on earth does the government plan to get it through? Can they?There are two factors that Number 10 hopes will come through for them. First off, they hope that once the deal is done officially with the EU, next Sunday (25 November), then the dynamic will change. Something along the lines of the leaked plan to sell the deal that we saw last week can get going, and when it does, expect it to rev up fast and loud.As we've discussed before plenty of times, the government machine will crank up fast and furiously to get MPs to back the deal - or else.And they also hope that more Labour MPs than currently expected will back them in the end. That's not just because they could choose a deal rather than open Pandora's box. But it's also because there's a belief in Number 10 that Labour's fellow politicians on the left around Europe will make it clear that frankly, this deal is the best the UK will get, and that a hypothetical Labour government couldn't and wouldn't do any better. Is that realistic, when the opposition party have the temptation of doing maximum damage to the government of the day? Let's see.For some of the government's critics, it's simply deluded to imagine they will be able to turn this debate around. The draft deal, only 48 hours after it was published, has been roundly attacked. There are many more MPs on the record now than are needed to defeat the agreement in Parliament. But it is impossible to be in the minds of the MPs contemplating turning in a letter calling for May to quit over the weekend.And harder still to be in the minds of those who will have an agonising choice if the deal makes it to the Commons in a few weeks time.It is calmer in Westminster tonight, but it is messy, and the danger hasn't gone away.

2018-11-18,Number crunching,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119041208/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46239782,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe Brexit deal which has been negotiated by the UK and the EU is expected to be agreed at a special EU summit on 25 November.After that, MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"".Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 51 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. Then there are, perhaps, a further 14 Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."

But how could this happen?Each party has its own rules for selecting a leader. Under the Conservatives' system, there are two ways to trigger a leadership contest.One, unsurprisingly, is if the leader resigns. The other is if 15% of Conservative MPs write letters saying they no longer have confidence in her.These letters have to be sent to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, which is made up of all backbench Conservative MPs.The 1922 Committee chairman - who is currently an MP called Graham Brady - does not reveal how many letters he has received until it reaches the 15% mark, which means 48 letters would have to be received.This would trigger a vote of confidence in Mrs May among all Tory MPs that could happen as soon as the next day. It would be a secret ballot, and if she won, she would be immune from challenge for a year.But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand.The 1922 Committee sets the timetable for the contest.Tory MPs then choose two candidates to present to a vote of the wider membership of the party.If necessary, they whittle the field down to two with a series of ballots where the lowest-ranking person is eliminated after each round.Then it is time for the party members to vote for the winner. The two candidates would be expected to take part in debates to put their cases forward to members before the final voting deadline.If there is only one candidate, that person becomes leader with no need for a vote from members.Unless there is a general election, the winner of any Tory leadership contest would also be expected to become prime minister."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn.

At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

Meanwhile, the DUP, which is opposed to the Irish border backstop proposal in the withdrawal agreement, abstained on amendments to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Monday evening. It also supported one amendment proposed by the Labour Party.The DUP has a so-called confidence-and-supply arrangement to support the Conservative Party, which does not have a majority in the House of Commons, which was secured with a controversial £1bn funding deal for Northern Ireland.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, told BBC's Newsnight the abstentions were made because the government had broken a fundamental agreement to deliver Brexit for the people of the UK ""as a whole"" and to not ""separate Northern Ireland constitutionally or economically from the United Kingdom"".The move was designed to send a political message back, he said.""'Look, we've got an agreement with you, but you've got to keep your side of the bargain, otherwise we don't feel obliged to keep ours.'"" A senior DUP source stressed, however, that this was not the end of the confidence-and-supply agreement between the Conservatives and the DUP. Also on Monday evening, the government said it would publish an economic analysis comparing the costs and benefits of its Brexit deal with those of the UK staying in the EU. A cross-party group of MPs had proposed an amendment to the Bill calling on ministers to publish the forecasts.  The government said MPs would be given the analysis before the meaningful vote on the final deal. It will look at a no-deal scenario, a free trade agreement and the government's proposed deal. The prime minister's appeal to business leaders came as Tory MPs continue to press for late changes to the deal.Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries have met in Brussels to work on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK - a meeting which revealed Spanish concern at the wording's impact on Gibraltar's future.Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, whose party is set to reject Mrs May's deal, told the CBI business lobby group's conference that Brexit can be a ""catalyst for economic transformation"" in the UK.There has been widespread criticism of the draft 585-page withdrawal agreement - and the short paper setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like - which are set to be finalised and signed off at an EU summit this weekend.Two of the prime minister's cabinet ministers resigned over the proposed deal, while others are believed to be trying to change its wording.Speculation continues over whether the number of Tory MPs submitting letters of no-confidence in Mrs May will reach the 48 required to trigger a confidence vote on her leadership of the Conservative Party.Mrs May told the CBI's annual conference in London that her plan would provide a fair immigration system that would help young people in the UK get jobs and training.  ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi.""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.""She also said she was not willing to reopen discussions with Brussels over the withdrawal agreement, saying ""the core elements of that deal are already in place"".She said that she expected to hammer out a framework for a future trade relationship in Brussels this week, before signing off the deal on Sunday.CBI president John Allan urged MPs to back Mrs May's deal - despite it not being ""perfect"" - and warned of the consequences for businesses if the UK were to simply crash out of the EU.The Labour leader said Mrs May's ""botched"" deal ""breaches the prime minister's own red lines"" and ""makes no mention of retaining frictionless trade"".Mr Corbyn suggested the EU would consider re-writing the draft agreement ""at the 11th hour"" if MPs rejected the proposals.He also suggested the UK's exit from the EU should be a catalyst for far-reaching economic and social change and a ""radical programme of investment"" in infrastructure, education and skills.The draft document sets out the terms of the UK's departure, including how much money will be paid to the EU, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights.The transition period - currently due to last until 31 December 2020 - will mean the UK is officially out of the EU, but still abiding by most of its rules. During this time, the two sides hope to negotiate a permanent trade deal.The UK and the EU want to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border whatever happens, so they agreed to a ""backstop"" - described as an insurance policy by Mrs May - aimed at achieving this if the sides cannot agree a trade deal that avoids a physically visible border. The backstop would mean Northern Ireland would stay more closely aligned to some EU rules, which critics say is unacceptable. And the whole of the UK would be in a single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.The critics say that during the transition period, the UK will still abide by most of the EU's rules but have no power over setting them - and there is no system for the UK being able to leave any backstop deal without the EU's agreement, so it could become a permanent arrangement.When asked whether the transition period could last until the end of 2022, Business Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It would be at our request and that would be a maximum period.""He said it could be extended for a matter of ""weeks or months"", and added: ""If we were six weeks away from concluding a future economic partnership and agreeing that, then it may make sense to extend the transition period.""Later, Mrs May told the CBI conference that it was ""important"" to be out of the implementation period before the next general election - which is due in June 2022.Environment Secretary Michael Gove, one of the five cabinet ministers who were believed to be trying to change the wording of the deal, said on Monday that the prime minister ""has my full support"" and she is doing a ""very good job"".""I hope people will get behind her as she endeavours to get the very, very best deal for Britain,"" he said.But former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson used his column in Monday's Daily Telegraph to renew his criticism of the draft agreement, describing it as a ""585-page fig-leaf [that] does nothing to cover the embarrassment of our total defeat"".And former Tory leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a vote of confidence would be a distraction.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, said any suggestions EU nationals had been given preferential treatment were wrong since they were merely ""exercising rights which provided freedom and opportunities"".EU citizens living, working, contributing to UK communities didn't ""jump the queue"" & neither did UK nationals in Europe. They were exercising rights which provided freedom & opportunities. We will fight to ensure these continue in the future, especially after any transition. https://t.co/p49HlFuUtwEnd of Twitter post  by @guyverhofstadtMichel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, called on all parties to ""remain calm"" and focus on the future agreement.Speaking at a press conference in Brussels after meeting the 27 other EU member states, he said the withdrawal deal was ""fair and balanced"" but made clear a transition period extension could not be indefinite, ""it has to be a fixed period of time"".During Monday's meeting, the Spanish government raised concerns about two articles in the withdrawal agreement (184 and 3), saying that taken together they add up to Gibraltar remaining permanently as UK territory.The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming says most member states, along with the European Commission and the European Council, do not agree with Madrid's reading of the text and are seeking to provide reassurance.

2018-11-19,The withdrawal agreement - what it all means,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119234348/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46237012,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues. Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.   Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-11-19,Rudd 'to listen to universal credit concerns',https://web.archive.org//web/20181119234348/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46265558,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWork and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has agreed to listen ""very carefully"" to concerns over universal credit, conceding the system ""can be better"".Making her first Commons appearance since getting the job on Friday, she faced calls from Labour and the SNP to halt the rollout of the single benefit.She said she would ""learn from errors"" and ""adjust"" the system, which she admitted had problems, where needed.She also rejected a UN report on UK poverty as ""extraordinarily political"".And she made clear that universal credit had an important role to play in reducing the number of workless families and tackling in-work poverty. The ex-home secretary replaced Esther McVey on Friday after she quit over Brexit. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she expected a change in tone from Ms Rudd and although not necessarily a major shift in policy. The government's plan is for almost seven million people to be on universal credit - which replaces six working age benefits - by the end of 2023.But the new system has been hit by delays and claims it is forcing some claimants into destitution and even prostitution. Labour has called for the next stage of the rollout - which will see 2.87 million people moved onto universal credit next summer - to be abandoned while the whole system is reconsidered. Answering questions from MPs about her department's work, Ms Rudd was pressed by Tory Sir Desmond Swayne to ensure the changes were ""measured and continually improved"".She replied: ""I share his view that it is vital as it is rolled out that we do learn from any errors, we do adjust it to make sure it properly serves the people it is intended to.""Ms Rudd said she would take heed of what campaigners have said about universal credit, following a call by 80 charities and other organisations for it to be halted.Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people.It replaces six benefits - income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit - and merge them into one payment:It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler. A single universal credit payment is paid directly into claimants' bank accounts to cover the benefits for which they are eligible.Claimants then have to pay costs such as rent out of their universal credit payment (though there is a provision for people who are in rent arrears or have difficulty managing their money to have their rent paid directly to their landlord).The latest available figures show that there were 1.1 million universal credit claimants in August. This makes up about half of all households claiming unemployment benefit, but only 10% of households claiming housing support and 2% of those claiming disability-related support. ""I am certainly going to be listening very carefully. Part of the benefit of the universal credit rollout is going to be making sure we get the expert guidance from the people who have been working in this field for many years and we will certainly be doing that.""But Ms Rudd took issue with the findings of a report by the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty who claimed last week that ministers were in a ""state of denial"" about poverty levels.Despite the UK being one of the world's richest countries, Philip Alston said he had encountered ""misery"" during his 12-day tour.Asked about the report in the Commons, she said: ""We are not so proud that we don't think we can learn as we try to adjust to universal credit for the benefit of everybody, but that sort of language was wholly inappropriate and actually discredited a lot of what he was saying.""The government has agreed on several occasions to slow the pace at which universal credit is extended across the UK.Ms McVey announced earlier this month that claimants would be given more time to switch to the new benefit.Among a number of other changes, she said they would not have to wait as long for their money and debt repayments would be reduced.In the Budget last month, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra £1bn over five years to help those moving to the new payments and a £1,000 increase in the amount people can earn before losing benefits, at a cost of up to £1.7bn a year."
2018-11-19,Spain demands Gibraltar veto in Brexit deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119234348/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46267684,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowSpain has said it will not agree to the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without clarity over how talks on the future status of Gibraltar should be handled.Foreign minister Josep Borrell insisted that talks about the territory were ""separate negotiations"".The country will not agree to the draft deal until that is clarified, he said following a meeting with EU ministers. Spain maintains a claim to Gibraltar, which was ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo tweeted a statement about Spain's comments, saying their position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"". Our press release on the matters raised this morning in Brussels in respect of the Withdrawal Agreement. pic.twitter.com/MywdmT12xZEnd of Twitter post  by @FabianPicardoArticle 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020.But Spain insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May meanwhile said the draft deal covers Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"".""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family.""Spain ceded the peninsula to the British Crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but has tried several times to recapture it.A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. Spain soon after closed its border with Gibraltar and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU."

The party also supported an amendment proposed by the Labour Party.The debate on the Finance Bill is due to last throughout Monday evening and into Tuesday, with the DUP expected to abstain on more amendments. The DUP have a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party.The Conservative government agreed a financial package with the DUP in exchange for support on certain issues.Around £430m has come to Northern Ireland's budget under the arrangement so far. The remainder of the £1bn is due to come in the 2019-20 financial year, with the York Street Interchange and rural broadband among the projects earmarked for cash.In recent weeks the relationship between the two parties has been strained following criticism by the DUP of the prime minister's draft Brexit agreement.The DUP have previously said it will review its arrangement propping up the Conservatives if the draft Brexit plan passes through Parliament.To date the DUP's 10 MPs have supported the government on key votes, but is opposed to the Irish border backstop proposal. The DUP have previously only abstained on one bill. Sammy Wilson from the DUP has a message for the government: ""You’ve got to keep your side of the bargain, otherwise we don’t feel obliged to keep ours"" #newsnight | @nicholaswatt pic.twitter.com/Hz9lB6q5T4End of Twitter post  by @BBCNewsnightThe DUP MP Sammy Wilson, the party's Brexit spokesperson, told BBC's The World Tonight that the government has ""seriously broken"" its commitment that it made with the DUP that Northern Ireland would not be treated differently from the rest of the UK in the Brexit agreement. ""Since the government has not honoured its side of the bargain we tonight tried to spell out some of the consequences of that,"" Mr Wilson said.However the East Antrim MP denied that the confidence and supply agreement pointing out that the Monday night's votes were not intended ""to damage the government fiscally"". He said that none of the votes in which the DUP voted with the opposition had financial consequences for the government, but they had political consequences. ""The prime minister has undermined her own authority with her own party and with our party by blatantly breaking promises about what she would deliver in the Brexit deal with the European Union,"" he said.Senior DUP sources told BBC News NI the DUP had taken the decision to abstain and then vote with Labour because ""we are not a happy bunch"".Another DUP source said it felt the government would respond in a ""tetchy manner, but then ho hum because we've a few who are good at that too"".The same source said the party does not believe the move breached the confidence and supply arrangement as the amendments were ""cost neutral"" - and that is now over to the government to respond.However, the text of the confidence and supply deal states that the DUP agrees to support the government on ""all motions of confidence... the budget, finance bills, money bills"".Commenting on the DUP not voting with the government Labour's Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, Jon Trickett MP, said: ""We no longer have a functioning government. With Brexit only a few months away something has got to give.""Forget for a moment the ""will they, won't they"" numbers game.Unless and until the head honcho of the Tories' backbench committee receives 48 letters there won't be a vote of no confidence in the prime minister.As far as we know tonight the total has not yet been reached.One of those who has submitted their letter told me in no uncertain terms ""where are the others?"" - frustrated that many of his colleagues seem to have promised to be part of the action, but reinforcements are yet to arrive.Read more: The DUP's Brexit message to Theresa May "

Mr Corbyn told business leaders that the plans were part of a radical programme of ""industrial and economic renewal"" needed after years of under-investment and economic deregulation.""Rigid and outdated"" economic thinking, he said, had contributed to widening inequality, with 20% of the country's wealth in the hands of only 1% of the population.The UK's ""profoundly unbalanced economy"" had been a factor in the Brexit vote, he said, and the UK's departure from the EU must lead to ""real change"" Business must play its part in boosting productivity and ensuring prosperity was shared more equally, particularly in areas of the country that felt ""left behind"" in recent years.He defended plans to force all large firms to put 1% of their share capital aside every year to give workers up to £500 in shares and to use the remainder to fund public services and welfare. ""Despite the frenzied reaction in certain sections of the press, there certainly is not any kind of war on business,"" he said of the plans. ""Actually it is the opposite, rather. ""We recognise the vast and vital contribution businesses make to our society and our economy and at the heart of that contribution are your employees.""They have an interest in the long-term success of your company...Workers create profits. Giving workers a share in them is not just fair, it is good for business.""Successive cuts in corporation tax bills since 2010 had not led to more investment or a better deal for workers, he said, and it was right the UK's largest firms paid more tax under a Labour government for the benefit of the ""common good"". ""It could not be clearer. Business as usual is not working. And when the rules of the game are not working for the overwhelming majority, the rules of the game need to change.""That means a new settlement for business and a stronger say for the workforce where government will drive a higher rate of investment in infrastructure, education, skills and the exciting new technologies of the future.""The largest businesses that can afford it will pay a little bit more towards the common good from which we will all benefit.""The CBI's director general Carolyn Fairbairn said UK plc was prepared to work with Mr Corbyn to build an economy that was both fair and more competitive.But she warned a ""command and control"" approach to the economy would alienate business.""Labour and business do share an ambition to tackle inequality, but the way to achieve this is through collaboration based on the belief that enterprise is a force for good,"" she said."

The former chancellor described his party's confidence-and-supply pact with the DUP as a ""bit irregular"".He said DUP politicians had reached ""the limit of their patience"" over Theresa May's Brexit approach.The prime minister on Monday renewed efforts to sell her draft EU withdrawal agreement.She insisted to business leaders at the CBI that her withdrawal deal has been ""agreed in full"", even as some Tory MPs continued to press for late changes.Ministers from the remaining 27 EU countries are in Brussels working on the political declaration setting out their future relationship with the UK, ahead of the deal being finalised on Sunday.Mr Clarke, who backed Remain, said Mrs May had not ""the slightest chance of getting the DUP back on side"".The two parties signed a confidence-and-supply arrangement after the Conservatives ended up without ended up without a Commons majority in last year's election. The government agreed a financial package in exchange for the support of the DUP's 10 MPs on certain issues - giving Mrs May a working majority of 328. But the DUP has threatened to abandon this deal if Brexit means new barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Clarke said he thought the withdrawal deal presented last week by the prime minister did not damage the integrity of the UK, despite DUP criticism.The Conservative former cabinet minister also said he did not accept that Northern Ireland was being treated differently to the rest of the UK on Brexit.The MP, who was first elected in 1970, said he was a ""very strong unionist"" and added that he did not want to see Northern Ireland ""drift away from the United Kingdom"".On life after Brexit, Mr Clarke said there needed to be something that ""resembles the single market, something that resembles the customs union for the whole of the United Kingdom"". Questioned on whether Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to suggest the deal would create a border in the Irish Sea, Mr Clarke said: ""It is a slight exaggeration.""He said livestock was currently checked and ""Northern Ireland obviously has to stay in the customs union and it has to stay in regulatory alignment with the south (Republic of Ireland )"".  The veteran politician, who served as chancellor and home secretary, said any alternative to the customs union or single market would make people in the UK ""just poorer"".Mr Clarke is currently father of the House of Commons.He said the withdrawal deal could be passed at Westminster if the prime minister worked with Labour backbenchers and supportive Conservative MPs.

Mr Banks and Leave.EU have denied any wrongdoing.The footage - archive that was recently re-examined by BBC Inside Out West - was filmed in the offices in Bristol then used by both Mr Banks's Eldon Insurance business and the campaign to leave the EU.It shows people apparently working for the referendum campaign who had previously worked in the insurance business.An operations manager says on camera she had worked for Mr Banks previously for six years in insurance before moving to the campaign.And an organisational chart shows names of staff who have worked for both organisations.In June of this year Mr Banks suggested to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee that staff had at no stage worked for both organisations.But earlier this month he admitted to Andrew Marr: ""People who did work for Eldon were transferred over on short-term contracts legally, and it was reported through the Electoral Commission in the right way.""The footage was filmed before spending restrictions over the European referendum came into force.In one sequence in the footage, Leave.EU chief executive Liz Bilney is seen at Mr Banks's office in Bristol asking an insurance worker to bring up an image for the Brexit campaign - at that point called The Know - on the screen and said ""just pretend that you're working on it"".Another worker says she had ""started in the insurance side"" having worked for Mr Banks for six years and then moved to work on the campaign. When asked in the 2015 footage if the social media team usually worked on insurance but could work on the leave campaign, Ms Bilney said they had looked at ""what skills are transferable and what skills aren't transferable"".""Social media skills, for example, are completely transferable and if you're a creative person you're creative and passionate about what you do,"" she said.""So we found that works and our finance director, for example, can look after our group so that skill, again, is a nice transferable skill.""She added that staff were ""very adaptable"" and said ""we like to morph and evolve into different things"".When Mr Banks was asked in the select committee hearing if he used ""staff that had previously worked in the insurance business in Leave.EU"", the businessman replied ""no, no"".What Arron Banks told the select committeeIan Lucas MP: ""You made clear earlier that you didn't use the same employees.""Arron Banks: ""So within our office we had an office set up that was for Leave.EU. It was a call centre. And we were getting a tremendous number of phone calls from our, obviously, the website, from Twitter, from Facebook and for the whole thing.""[Later in the same hearing]Mr Lucas: ""So did you use staff that had previously worked in the insurance business in Leave.EU?""Mr Banks: ""No. No.""Mr Lucas: ""Where did these people come from?""Mr Banks: ""Well we created a team of people as you would do in a business. We just put people together.""Ms Bilney has since said the people who had previously worked for the insurance firm were on ""seconded contracts until they were seconded back after the referendum"".She added that other functions, such as IT and HR, were billed to Leave.EU by Eldon Insurance after the referendum and that a compliance officer had overseen this.Ms Bilney also admitted in an interview with the BBC in the past week that employees had worked for both businesses and said that Mr Banks's comments to the MPs had been taken out of context.Having seen the footage, Damian Collins, the Conservative MP who chairs the select committee, said: ""The people working on computers there could just switch seamlessly between one campaign to the other. ""Now, if this was kept totally separate, then that wouldn't be possible. You would have firewalls in place to stop people doing that, to make sure these things are kept completely separate.""But what you can see here is it quite clearly wasn't separate at all, it was all mixed up together. So it means he, Aaron Banks, wasn't telling the truth or giving us the full picture when he gave evidence to parliament.""Of course, it raises all sorts of questions that if workers were working on both campaigns at the same time, how was that accounted for to the Electoral Commission in terms of time and also were there any breaches of data protection law because of the different ways data was being processed?""Ms Bilney has denied data was used improperly.Mr Banks said: ""The BBC have been working with Open Democracy, which is a second referendum campaign funded by Remain supporting groups, to smear my business interests.""They contain identical points put to us by this activist group, the purpose of which is to discredit the Brexit campaign.""The BBC has not worked with Open Democracy on this report into links between staff for Eldon Insurance and Leave.EU.Mr Collins said the footage would feed into the select committee's inquiry into fake news.Mr Banks is the subject of a police probe into claims he was not the ""true source"" of £8m loaned to Leave.EU.An investigation into the businessman's donations to Leave.EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum has been referred by the Electoral Commission to the National Crime Agency, which has said potential criminal offences may have been committed."

They were sold for £11,025 to Nottinghamshire-based Reclamations (Ollerton) Ltd who will dismantle them and export the parts.Current Mayor Sadiq Khan said ""we have managed to finally get rid of them"". The vehicles were bought by Mr Johnson from Germany in 2014 and he volunteered to be blasted by one of them to reassure people of their safety.Then-Home Secretary Theresa May banned their use in riot situations in England and Wales in 2015, and later used the purchase to ridicule Mr Johnson in the Tory leadership race after David Cameron resigned. Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland but have never been deployed in the rest of the UK.The cannon Mr Johnson bought cost £322,000 to purchase second-hand and then refit. Costs included £32,004 for low emission zone compliance, £19,035 for re-painting, £3,109 for signage, and £970 for the fitting of radios and CD players.Mr Khan said: ""For too long, London taxpayers have had to bear the brunt of Boris Johnson's appalling botched water cannon deal. This has been another waste of taxpayers' money by Boris Johnson.""After Mrs May banned the cannon's use, the Metropolitan Police said it was ""naturally disappointed"" with the decision. It said while the weapons would rarely, ""if ever"", be used, they were ""a sensible precaution which would allow us to deal with a number of specific public disorder situations"".A source close to Mr Johnson said during his time as mayor he had cut crime, adding: ""This is a legacy the new mayor has sadly been unable to match.""In the wake of the London riots, with a worrying rise in knife crime and with his hands tied by the political decisions in the Home Office, Boris made tackling crime his number one priority.""The sale was announced as details were revealed of 72 youth projects that will receive the latest round of grants from the Young Londoners Fund.The schemes, which are aimed at diverting young people away from crime, will receive a share of £13.2m. Projects include the Ben Kinsella Trust, Redthread and Football Beyond Borders."

The BBC has spoken to five charities and organisations in England who say there are increasing numbers of women on the credit (UC) in this position.Frank Field, MP for Birkenhead, also told MPs in October ""some women have taken to the red-light district for the first time"" as a result of UC.The government said: ""No-one has to face hardship on Universal Credit.""""Julie"", from Merseyside, never thought she would have to turn to sex work.But an eight-week wait for the single mum's first payment after transferring from her previous benefits left her ""desperate"", so when she was offered £30 for sex she took it.""I'm ashamed to admit, I have slept with a guy for money"", said Julie, who asked for her real name not to be used.""It's something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing. I just didn't think it was in me as a person.""So I'm, like, very disappointed in myself and ashamed of myself. ""I had to use food banks. I've never been in that situation in my life. I've really struggled.""When Mr Field made his comments in the Commons, then Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said work needed to be done to help them.""Perhaps [Mr Field] could tell these ladies and the work coaches that now we have got record job vacancies - 830,000 job vacancies - and perhaps there are other jobs on offer,"" she said.But Mr Field told the BBC he had received no contact from the government since raising the issue in parliament,  following UC's introduction in his constituency in November 2017.""[Women turning to sex work is] an absolute indictment of welfare reform… it seems that you couldn't get a worse result,"" he said. Universal Credit is a payment to help with living costs, replacing six benefits:People on a low income or out of work may be eligible, depending on where they live and their circumstances.Source: gov.ukCritics of the new benefit payment have said that many people have been forced to wait weeks for their first payment and the government has apologised for ""mistakes"" in the scheme's introduction.In an interview with Radio 4's You and Yours, Julie said it was this delay that forced her to turn to sex work.""I didn't go out looking for it, I said no at first. It wasn't until about three weeks later that I said 'OK, yeah,' because I thought I need to, because I need money,"" she said. ""It was during the eight weeks that I was waiting to get the Universal Credit. It couldn't wait eight weeks for money. I just couldn't.""It definitely wasn't a decision I took lightly. I was so angry with myself afterwards. But I've been put in that situation and I had no choice.""She does now receive the benefit payments and said ""without it, I would be on the streets, I would have no food. I'd have nothing"".Angela Murphy, from the Tomorrow's Women Wirral charity, said Julie was not alone.""That's a very familiar story ... the delay [in payments] is massive, how are you supposed to cope?"" she said. ""So people think its as a quick fix: 'I'll go out, do a bit of sex work, it's a quick fix'. But then they get trapped.""Cari Mitchell, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, said they have also heard reports of women turning to sex work as a result of Universal Credit's introduction, to replace six existing benefit payments.""Most sex workers are mothers and most of those are single mothers,"" she said.""They're placed in an impossible situation where for increasing numbers the option to go into the sex industry in order to survive becomes real.""A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: ""No-one has to face hardship on Universal Credit, and 100% advances are available from day one of a claim.""The government was ""committed to tackling the harm and exploitation that can be associated with prostitution,"" he said.Have you had a similar experience as a result of Universal Credit's introduction?

The Labour leader wants a general election which will only happen with Tory acquiescence.Their joint need for each to reach their respective goals means that the pair may have to make compromises which, at the moment, appear unthinkable. But it may be the price they have to pay for survival - in the prime minister's case - and for a route to No 10 in the case of the Labour leader.For the moment, we will hear the prime minister saying she will not cut any deals with other parties in the run up to the ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament. She will say the parties should do as she has done in the Brexit negotiations and simply act in the national interest to vote for her deal to avoid no deal or no Brexit.For his part, Jeremy Corbyn will say that Labour will vote down the prime minister's deal on the grounds that it fails the party's six Brexit tests. Labour believes it is on strong ground here because sources say Michel Barnier has indicated to the party that the EU would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal if another UK government found itself in office following a rejection of the current deal in Parliament.Downing St hopes those Labour dreams will be quashed on Sunday if EU leaders endorse the Brexit deal at a summit in Brussels. No 10 is hoping that the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker will say the withdrawal agreement has been finalised and cannot be reopened.No 10 is also hoping that at this point Labour would have to compromise and, at the very least, not block the deal in Parliament. Expect the prime minister to say that a vote against the deal would be thwarting the will of the people.At this point, however, Jeremy Corbyn would have a strong hand to play because the prime minister will probably not be able to pass her deal solely on the basis of Tory and DUP votes. With her fate in his hands, the Labour leader may well feel he could exact a price for allowing the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement to pass through Parliament.The Labour price could be: the party will allow the EU divorce settlement to pass in exchange for the prime minister agreeing to a general election to allow the British people to elect a government to negotiate the next stage of Brexit. That is the future partnership that will decide the UK's relationship with the EU in the decades to come.And so in the coming month Theresa May could find herself having to agree to the one thing she has been desperate to avoid (a general election) as the price for the thing she desperately needs (a withdrawal agreement with the EU). If the prime minister agreed to such a Labour request she would then have to whip her MPs to vote in favour of an early general election. At that point Sir Graham Brady may find confidence letters from Tory MPs piling up in his letter box - if such a vote has not already been held by then. And so the Brexit saga goes round in circles.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer. Subscribe to the programme on YouTube or follow them on Twitter."
2018-11-19,Can May learn from Ted Heath's tactics?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119234348/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46254257,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIn four months the UK is set to leave the EU but nobody in Westminster is sure how. Parliament has seen plenty of drama during its tortured relationship with Europe but the House of Commons has never looked more fractured than it does on the brink of departure. Some MPs want to stay in the EU while others seem relaxed about leaving with no deal at all. Some want the UK to be bound as closely as possible to the continent's economy while others would be content with much looser ties. The draft withdrawal agreement the prime minister intends to put before MPs soon has been rubbished by people in all parties, including her own. The only certainty is that, somehow, Parliament must decide what happens next. Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs. And now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal.Europe was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community.After becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels. However, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons. Even though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big. But within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across. The six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971. It was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing). Unlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult.On October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote.  ""Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,"" he growled at Day. But the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move. ""Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the ""Jenkinsites"" could justify defying a  Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,"" Clarke told me.  The logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government. One of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen. ""It was typical Heath,"" Lord Owen says now. ""No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament. ""And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now."" Lord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found. According to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise. ""Both parties are shattered into fractions,"" he says. As things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes.On the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs. Although 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions. For MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter.  There are differences of course. Today, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975. There was then a binary choice between in or out. Today, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic. Nor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt. But if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons. Edward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.Listen to '71: The Vote to go In on Monday, 19 November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 - or after it has been broadcast on BBC Sounds."

CBI President John Allan will open Monday's annual conference by admitting that while the Prime Minister's deal is not perfect, it is a lot better than leaving with no deal - an outcome he will describe as a ""wrecking ball"". Mrs May, speaking later, will have the chance to sell the deal herself.She is expected to focus on how immigration will change after the UK leaves the EU, which is an area of concern for many businesses. She will say that EU nationals will no longer be able to ""jump the queue"" ahead of skilled workers from India or Australia. While business approves of the government's plans to make it easier for more high-skilled workers to come to the UK from outside the EU, business leaders are worried about her plans to make it much harder to access workers of lower skill levels. Unemployment is at historic lows and 130,000 EU nationals left the UK in the last 12 months. Competition for workers has seen welcome rises in average pay in recent months but businesses are reporting acute skills shortages in some areas, including construction. While most businesses will support Mrs May for fear of a no deal - in picking immigration as a focus, she's chosen one subject this audience has serious doubts about. "
2018-11-19,Big risks remain,https://web.archive.org//web/20181119234348/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46242217,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWestminster seems more peaceful tonight. Maybe I should just stop there. It is Friday night after all, and after the Big Dipper ride of the last few days, maybe for Number 10, and maybe for you, that's enough to be going on with for now. But Number 10 knows they'd be kidding themselves to imagine that the danger has gone. We simply won't know, probably until Monday, whether there are enough Tory MPs willing to put their names to letters calling for her to go to trigger a vote on confidence in her that might - in theory - force her from office. It is possible that by the start of next week Theresa May finds herself with a vote that could unseat her.If she doesn't, or even if she does but then wins such a vote, here's the problem.More than 20 MPs have put their names out there publicly calling on her to go and screaming protests at her Brexit deal. They might not get their confidence vote. Even if they do, they might not get enough support to oust her.But it seems impossible for those who have put their names out there to vote for the Brexit deal in a few weeks time. With the DUP bristling with rage about the deal and how it was arrived at, and very little sign of a cavalry of Labour MPs riding to the rescue, the number of public protests from those Tory MPs makes it seem like Theresa May's agreement is doomed.In that regard, how on earth does the government plan to get it through? Can they?There are two factors that Number 10 hopes will come through for them. First off, they hope that once the deal is done officially with the EU, next Sunday (25 November), then the dynamic will change. Something along the lines of the leaked plan to sell the deal that we saw last week can get going, and when it does, expect it to rev up fast and loud.As we've discussed before plenty of times, the government machine will crank up fast and furiously to get MPs to back the deal - or else.And they also hope that more Labour MPs than currently expected will back them in the end. That's not just because they could choose a deal rather than open Pandora's box. But it's also because there's a belief in Number 10 that Labour's fellow politicians on the left around Europe will make it clear that frankly, this deal is the best the UK will get, and that a hypothetical Labour government couldn't and wouldn't do any better. Is that realistic, when the opposition party have the temptation of doing maximum damage to the government of the day? Let's see.For some of the government's critics, it's simply deluded to imagine they will be able to turn this debate around. The draft deal, only 48 hours after it was published, has been roundly attacked. There are many more MPs on the record now than are needed to defeat the agreement in Parliament. But it is impossible to be in the minds of the MPs contemplating turning in a letter calling for May to quit over the weekend.And harder still to be in the minds of those who will have an agonising choice if the deal makes it to the Commons in a few weeks time.It is calmer in Westminster tonight, but it is messy, and the danger hasn't gone away.

Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"".Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 51 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. Then there are, perhaps, a further 14 Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

The PM is under pressure from her own MPs not to give any further ground.She appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least.However, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal - which will be put before European leaders this weekend. All sides in the Commons have warned of a ""blind Brexit"" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements.Please upgrade your browserThe withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a £39bn ""divorce bill"" and the controversial customs ""backstop"" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border.However, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.Any binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some UK ministers still believed there was time for a few ""nips and tucks"" to the withdrawal agreement reached in principle last week.During a flying visit to Brussels designed to prepare the ground for this weekend's summit of EU leaders, Mrs May will hold talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker.The prime minister departs for Brussels with her position seeming more secure, despite a week of cabinet resignations and political plotting to remove her from post.On Tuesday one of Mrs May's most ardent critics, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the time ""is now"" for fellow backbenchers to either force a confidence vote in Mrs May or have her lead the party into the next election.But he accepted it could be next month before the required threshold of 48 letters needed to trigger a contest was reached. The prime minister's allies insist she would win any confidence vote, with party rules meaning she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months.And a YouGov poll commissioned by the Times suggests that 46% of voters backed Mrs May staying in post, against just 33% a week ago.By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editorCould this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?Grumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.They're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Theresa May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.Engaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for Mrs May.A high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a (presumably planned) late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow the prime minister to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won… in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.Discussions in Brussels focus on the political declaration outlining relations from the scheduled end of the transition period in 2021. Currently running to 20 pages, it will sit alongside the withdrawal agreement.The BBC understands the intention is still to present a completed text to leaders at Sunday's summit but opinions differ over how easy it would be to solve the outstanding issues.Spain has warned it will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar.Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and it wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar.Ambassadors from the EU's 27 remaining countries had been due to be briefed on the final text on Tuesday but the meeting has been re-scheduled for later this week."

They were made after it became clear the Democratic Unionists, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, again said they would not support the Tories.Mr Rees-Mogg said he had not given up hope of getting the 48 letters of no confidence in the PM needed to trigger a vote.""What we are seeing from this government is a deliberate decision not to deliver a proper Brexit,"" he told reporters at a Westminster news conference.""We have a government led by Remainers who want to keep us tied into the EU as tightly as possible.""He said the 48 letter threshold might be reached next month when MPs get a ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement. But he added: ""I think (the time) is now, or the prime minister will lead the Conservatives into the next election.Mrs May's allies insist she would win a no confidence vote and under Conservative rules she would then be immune from a challenge for 12 months.The PM says her Brexit deal is the best the UK can get from Brussels and it will allow the country to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"".In other developments:Downing Street said that, during talks with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the PM had emphasised that the draft Brexit terms would give Scottish businesses the ""clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards and see us take back control of our waters"". The SNP leader also met Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn earlier to discuss tactics ahead of the Commons vote.Ms Sturgeon held a separate meeting with Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, who all back another EU referendum.She told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg she wanted to form a ""coalition of opposition"" to Mrs May's Brexit plans, and that momentum for another referendum was growing.She described her talks with Mr Corbyn as ""exploratory"" and said she did not know whether he would back a referendum.But she said they both agreed that the PM's Brexit deal is a bad one and that no-deal should not be the only alternative presented to MPs.A Labour spokesman said: ""They discussed their common opposition to Theresa May's botched Brexit deal and determination to work across Parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome.""As it stands, there appears to be a majority in Parliament against the deal.And Mrs May is coming under growing pressure from the DUP, whose 10 MPs keep her government in power.The DUP abstained in Monday night's Budget votes as a warning shot over what they say are her broken promises on Brexit.After the DUP indicated they would abstain again on further votes on Tuesday, ministers accepted Labour and SNP amendments in order to avoid likely defeat.These will require the government to conduct a review into the public health impact of gaming, a report into the impact of Brexit on international tax enforcement and a review into the impact of tax avoidance measures on income inequality and child poverty. Under the terms of their House of Commons deal, agreed after Mrs May lost her Commons majority in last year's general election, the DUP is supposed to back the government on Budget matters and on confidence votes.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said their refusal to do so now was ""absolutely staggering"", adding that the Conservatives were ""in office but not in power"".

2018-11-20,Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46267684,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPrime Minister Pedro Sánchez has said Spain will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar.Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.It wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar.""As things stand today if there are no changes regarding Gibraltar, Spain will vote no on Brexit,"" said Mr Sánchez.Throughout the Brexit negotiations, Spain - along with Ireland and Cyprus - has conducted separate talks with the UK about specific border issues. On Monday Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said that the draft Brexit deal had failed to make clear that talks on Gibraltar were ""separate negotiations"" and not part of future talks between the UK and EU.Mr Sánchez added his weight to those remarks on Tuesday at a forum in Madrid, emphasising that any future negotiations on Gibraltar had to be bilateral.""As a country we cannot assume that whatever happens in the future with Gibraltar would be negotiated by the UK and EU - it will have to be negotiated between Spain and the UK,"" he said.Article 184 of the draft Brexit deal says the EU and the UK will seek to ""negotiate rapidly the agreements governing their future relationship"" between the official day of withdrawal on 29 March 2019 and the end of a transition period in December 2020.But Spain believes the article in question is ambiguous and wants to ensure that this does not apply to the future of Gibraltar. It insists on its future right to discuss the status of the peninsula bilaterally with the UK, and is seeking clarity that this draft deal will allow it to do so. Asked about the Spanish objection to Article 184, a European Commission spokesman said they were aware of Spain's concerns. He said the EU's position on Gibraltar had been made clear in April 2017 guidelines, that after Brexit no agreement between the EU and UK could apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the UK and Spain.Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Spain of adopting a ""well-known tactic"" of raising issues at the last minute. He said Spain's position ""does little to build mutual confidence and trust going forward"". Our press release on the matters raised this morning in Brussels in respect of the Withdrawal Agreement. pic.twitter.com/MywdmT12xZEnd of Twitter post  by @FabianPicardoA spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the draft deal covered Gibraltar as well as ""the other overseas territories and the crown dependencies"".""We will get a deal that works for the whole UK family.""By Gavin Lee, Europe reporterSpain and Britain have been running parallel negotiations over the future of Gibraltar, alongside the main EU-UK Brexit negotiations. Those talks have led to a ""protocol"" being agreed and three Spanish-British committees being set up to tackle tobacco smuggling, oversee cross-border workers rights, and co-operate on environmental protection and border control. There seemed to be no drama on the horizon and the Spanish prime minister told me a few weeks ago he had ""no significant concerns over Gibraltar"", that the ""behaviour of the British government was good"" and an agreement could be reached.So what has changed? The Spanish government says that its ""bone of contention"" is with one specific article in the draft Withdrawal Agreement that was only added last week, just before it was signed off by the European Commission, and wasn't seen by Spanish negotiators.  A senior Spanish diplomat told me that Spain wanted the following words (or similar) added to Article 184: ""This does not apply to Gibraltar, which will be subject to bilateral talks between the UK and Spain.""Underlying all of this is the fact that Spain still disputes that Gibraltar as a British overseas territory. Spanish officials refer to the rock as a ""British colony"" and, although the Spanish government isn't seeking to use the Brexit talks to push that claim, it is making it clear that any decision over the future of Gibraltar can only happen with the approval of Madrid.Though Spain ceded the peninsula under the 1713 treaty, it has tried several times to regain control over it.A referendum in the territory in 1967 saw 99.6% of residents vote to remain British. A proposal for joint sovereignty was also decisively rejected by Gibraltarians in a 2002 vote.Spain closed its border with Gibraltar after the 1967 vote and did not fully reopen it until 1985, the year before Spain joined the European Economic Community - the forerunner of the EU.Gibraltar profile "
2018-11-20,Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46274118,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May is facing a backlash after she said EU workers would no longer be able to ""jump the queue"" after Brexit.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's words were ""disgraceful"" and EU citizens living in the UK said they would fuel hate crimes against them.The comments came in a speech to business leaders on Monday, in which she vowed to end EU free movement after Brexit. Downing Street said EU citizens made an ""important contribution"" to the UK.The government says it wants the estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU nations already living in the UK to stay after Brexit but they will have to apply for leave to remain. But Mrs May used her speech to the CBI to highlight the fact that the proposed EU withdrawal agreement will bring an ""end to free movement, once and for all"".The government has yet to set out details of what this will mean in practice in the longer term, but Mrs May has said at some point in the future, after the post-Brexit relationship between the UK and the EU kicks in, that EU citizens will be treated the same as those arriving from outside the EU.""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi,"" said Mrs May in her speech.""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.""Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the prime minister's language was ""offensive"" and ""disgraceful"".""That the case for Brexit has been reduced to such a miserable and self-defeating bottom line is depressing in the extreme. Let's lift our sights higher than this.""Actually, the more I think about it, the more offensive 'jump the queue' is as a description of a reciprocal right of free movement. Really disgraceful.""The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt also criticised Mrs May.""EU citizens living, working, contributing to UK communities, didn't 'jump the queue' and neither did UK nationals in Europe,"" he said.""They were exercising rights which provided freedom and opportunities. We will fight to ensure these continue in the future, especially after any transition."" EU citizens living in the UK took to social media to accuse the prime minister of using them as scapegoats to shore up support for her Brexit agreement. It's time we all woke up to the fact that @The3Million are being made scapegoats by a nasty, incompetent government, that lies and dog whistles instead of having the backbone to take responsibility for the mess they've created. Shame on you @theresa_may!https://t.co/0J2Imwi9LSEnd of Twitter post  by @FinalSayForAllCitizens rights campaigner and professor of history at Northumbria University Tanja Bueltmann said the PM's ""despicable"" comments were a ""punch in the face"" for EU citizens like her who had made their home in the UK.""We are your neighbours, colleagues, friends and family; your doctors, hairdressers and teachers,"" she said in a Huffington Post article. Mrs May's words ""essentially cast us as unwanted queue-jumpers, cheats and people without skills and talents undeserving to be here, in our own home,"" she added. She accused the prime minister of trying to set one group against another - and said her words would mean EU citizens would have to ""brace themselves for yet more hate over the coming months"".""The press called May's speech her Brexit fightback. It is not. But it is a fight on the back of EU citizens. In less than a week, May reduced us from 'valued citizens' to 'queue-jumpers.'""Mike Galsworthy, a director of anti-Brexit campaign Scientists4EU, accused the prime minister of playing a ""cynical"" blame game to sell her Brexit agreement, in a video message on Twitter.May just threw EU citizens in UK, expats & youth under the bus in order to sell her Brexit plan. It’s shameful. https://t.co/6J1PQvKeyIEnd of Twitter post  by @mikegalsworthy""EU citizens already contributing to the UK didn't get here by jumping the queue, they got here by being the best person for that job,"" said Mr Galsworthy.Any hurdles faced by workers from outside the EU, such as visa and financial stipulations, had been placed there by the UK government, he added.The prime minister's official spokesman, when asked whether Mrs May regarded EU nationals currently working in the NHS and other public services as having ""jumped the queue"", said: ""We have always been clear of the important contribution which EU citizens make to our economy and to public services.""The point the prime minister is making is that we wish to have a global system where people's skills are the basis on which they are able to work in the UK.""At the moment, we have two systems in place - one for people coming to the UK from outside the EU and one for people coming under the rules of free movement. ""It's a fact that people coming under the system of free movement don't need a visa and those from outside the EU do.""The spokesman said an immigration white paper setting out the proposed new system was due to be published ""shortly""."

The truth is that SNP plans just make a no deal Brexit more likely.""Ms Sturgeon also admitted she has not yet found common ground with Labour over an alternative Brexit deal after meeting UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn.She held talks with Mr Corbyn in Westminster to try to coalesce around another way forward but said ""we're not there yet"".She said she wanted to see a ""coalition of opposition"" over the draft Brexit deal after speaking to Mr Corbyn.And she said there was a ""strong willingness"" among the opposition parties to work together.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Corbyn have both criticised Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit agreement, which was published last week.Mrs May argues that the plan is the only realistic chance of avoiding a ""no deal"" Brexit.But there has been widespread criticism of the draft 585-page withdrawal agreement and the short paper setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like. Two of the prime minister's cabinet ministers have resigned - including her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab - while others are believed to be trying to change its wording, and there has been talk of a Tory leadership challenge.Ms Sturgeon, who says she wants to find a ""workable alternative"" to the deal, held ""exploratory"" talks with Mr Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, ahead of her meeting with the prime minister.She told the BBC there was agreement with Mr Corbyn that the prime minister's deal was a bad one, and that no deal should not be the only alternative.The first minister added: ""The next stages of all of this have to be to look at what we can coalesce around in terms of alternatives"".She also claimed that momentum for another referendum on Brexit was growing. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn's meeting with Ms Sturgeon had been ""constructive"", with the pair discussing their ""common opposition"" to the draft Brexit agreement and their ""determination to work across parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome.""Ms Sturgeon has already said the 35 SNP MPs will vote against the deal in the House of Commons and has accused the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" between the agreement and a no-deal Brexit. The first minister has called for continued, permanent single market and customs union membership for the whole of the UK as an alternative, and has been highly critical of the ""backstop"" proposals for Northern Ireland, which she has said could have a ""devastating"" impact on jobs and investment in Scotland if they are enacted. The UK's four farming unions, including NFU Scotland, have given their support to Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal agreement, saying it was ""not perfect"" but would allow trade in agricultural goods, as well as food and drink, to continue largely as before.  And Mrs May's defacto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, last week urged Ms Sturgeon to ""listen to what Scottish business is saying"" and back the agreement.He added: ""Scottish business is lining up with business throughout the UK to say we want a deal. It will give us clarity, certainty - we can plan, we can count on investment, we can decide upon jobs staying in Scotland. ""The way in which to put prosperity and jobs in Scotland at risk is to prolong the uncertainty rather than to take the ambitious, good, compromise deal that is on offer.""On Monday, the prime minister tried to persuade business leaders that the deal offered the best way forward, saying it would stop EU migrants from being able to ""jump the queue"".She told the CBI conference in London that migration would become skills-based, with Europeans no longer prioritised over ""engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi"".Ms Sturgeon later tweeted that she believed the prime minister's choice of words was ""offensive"" and ""disgraceful"".Mr Corbyn told the same conference that Brexit could be a ""catalyst for economic transformation"" in the UK. Labour has said its priority is to secure a general election, and has argued that there is still time to secure a better Brexit deal."

2018-11-20,The withdrawal agreement - what it all means,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46237012,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 585 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union, scheduled for 29 March 2019.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders in the future, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now, are also unresolved issues. Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.   Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-11-20,What to look for in Brexit declaration?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46278361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU and UK are poised to complete the document that will spell out the shape of their future post-Brexit relationship and pave the way for a trade deal. The Political Declaration on the future framework will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement that settles the terms of the UK's departure, but the declaration will not be legally binding. A seven-page outline has been published. BBC Brussels Reporter Adam Fleming explains what to look for in the final version.  Discussions in Brussels about how many pages will be in the document are like a game of bingo. ""50! 14! 16! 20!"" Whatever the length, it has to be detailed enough to satisfy the UK and the EU. It has to offer the UK a vision of the future that will convince MPs to accept the divorce-related part of the deal.For the EU, it has to provide guidance to steer the negotiations about the future relationship, which will begin in earnest after Brexit. Their watchword is ""precision"". Expect it to cover a lot of sectors, such as trade, aviation, financial services, energy, crime. The EU's original plan was to publish the outline in October and then spend a month filling in the details with the UK, while consulting the member states. The timetable slipped, so that's now happening in about a week instead. Last week the EU's top negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the biggest areas of disagreement were trade and security. Britain is said to be asking for the political declaration to reflect Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a UK/EU free trade area in goods, with a common rulebook. Some EU countries think that's too similar to being a member. The EU also isn't prepared - so far - to continue the status quo on security. This includes co-operation on extradition and access to European databases. Language is being sought to ensure everyone can claim they got what they wanted. Both sides have agreed that the EU will apply its existing system for judging whether the financial services regulations of other countries are as good as its own, known as ""equivalence"". We might find out if the UK has succeeded in getting some additional safeguards in the equivalence regime that could help out the City of London. Or we might not. In the last few days the other 27 member states have raised concerns about some areas and asked for clarification. France leads a group of countries that want more clarity on the so-called ""level-playing field"" - measures that would put constraints on the UK in return for easy access to the single market, such as compliance with EU competition, environmental and social law. Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and others want to reinforce the EU's policy that European trawlers should have continued access to British waters in return for the UK being allowed to sell its fish in Europe.The Spanish government wants reassurance about the extent to which the future relationship will apply to Gibraltar. Some of these issues may be addressed in documents that accompany the political declaration, for example in the minutes of the meeting of EU leaders. Yes, more documents!One sentence in the outline version caught my eye. It said the ""extent of the UK's commitments on customs and regulatory co-operation, including with regard to the alignment of rules, to be taken into account in the application of checks and controls at the border.""This is code for a sliding scale of frictionless trade. The message is: ""Apply EU rules and sign up to something that looks like a customs union, then there will be many fewer checks on the millions of trucks that go through Calais.""It means the internal argument the UK has had about rules, regulations and customs will continue well into the negotiations on the future. This section is called ""institutional arrangements"". It proposes that the UK/EU relationship is managed via a series of ministerial meetings and prime ministerial summits.Yes, a bit like the EU. It will also contain clues about how the next phase of talks will unfold. For me, it's the most important part because it will decide what I'll be doing for at least the next three years. "
2018-11-20,Sugar tax on soft drinks raises £154m,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46279224,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe new sugar tax on soft drinks has raised £153.8m since it was introduced in April, the government has said.The figure, which covers the period to the end of October, means the tax is on track to raise the estimated proceeds of £240m for the full year.The new tax is applied to soft drinks with a certain amount of sugar per litre. Health officials have warned that more action could be taken against the food industry unless it cuts sugar further.Public Health England (PHE) says if the food industry has not made enough progress on sugar reduction it could face further measures.PHE has been working to cut sugar and calories in everyday foods, such as breakfast cereals, yogurts, pizzas and ready meals, by 20%.Its latest survey found 90% of the public said they supported the government working with industry to make food and drinks healthier.But most think the responsibility for tackling obesity lies primarily with individuals themselves and families. The clampdown on sugar use has seen certain leading brands, including Fanta, Ribena and Lucozade, cut the sugar content of their drinks.The introduction of the levy means the UK joins a small handful of nations that have introduced similar taxes, including Mexico, France and Norway.The levy is applied to manufacturers - whether they pass it on to consumers or not is up to them.  There are 457 producers registered for the levy.Drinks with more than 8g per 100ml face a tax rate equivalent to 24p per litre.Those containing 5-8g of sugar per 100ml face a slightly lower rate of tax, of 18p per litre.Pure fruit juices are exempt as they do not carry added sugar, while drinks with a high milk content are also be exempt due to their calcium content.Originally, the Treasury forecast it would raise more than £500m a year, but that has now been reduced to £240m because some manufacturers have reduced the sugar content in their products.In England that income is being invested in school sports and breakfast clubs.Products such as cakes, biscuits and other foods are not covered by the tax, although a separate initiative is encouraging manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of those items voluntarily."

British farmers have been banned from producing foie gras - meaning fatty liver - on cruelty grounds since 2000.But restaurants and shops are allowed to import the product, regarded as a gastronomic delicacy by manufacturers and some consumers, under EU free-market rules. The UK imports 180 to 200 tonnes each year, almost exclusively from France. Mr Drew said Brexit provided the UK with the ideal opportunity to stop the trade, which can involve animals as young as 12 weeks being force-fed to fatten their livers. His attempt to use the Agriculture Bill, a proposed new law designed to prepare the farming industry for the UK's departure from the EU, to legislate for a ban was defeated on party lines.The Conservatives have a majority on the public bill committee now scrutinising the legislation. ""I am not surprised that the government did not want to accept it,"" Mr Drew said. ""(Tory) MPs see the writing on the wall but they won't do it at this moment.""The shadow environment minister vowed to keep the pressure up on the government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said when it was no longer bound by EU freedom of movement rules relating to goods, the UK would be able to consider the case for restricting sales of certain products under WTO rules.""The Agriculture Bill is not the place to make provisions for trade and import,"" a spokeswoman said. ""This is a debate to be had in discussions on the future trading relationship with the EU."""

The Labour leader wants a general election which will only happen with Tory acquiescence.Their joint need for each to reach their respective goals means that the pair may have to make compromises which, at the moment, appear unthinkable. But it may be the price they have to pay for survival - in the prime minister's case - and for a route to No 10 in the case of the Labour leader.For the moment, we will hear the prime minister saying she will not cut any deals with other parties in the run up to the ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament. She will say the parties should do as she has done in the Brexit negotiations and simply act in the national interest to vote for her deal to avoid no deal or no Brexit.For his part, Jeremy Corbyn will say that Labour will vote down the prime minister's deal on the grounds that it fails the party's six Brexit tests. Labour believes it is on strong ground here because sources say Michel Barnier has indicated to the party that the EU would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal if another UK government found itself in office following a rejection of the current deal in Parliament.Downing St hopes those Labour dreams will be quashed on Sunday if EU leaders endorse the Brexit deal at a summit in Brussels. No 10 is hoping that the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker will say the withdrawal agreement has been finalised and cannot be reopened.No 10 is also hoping that at this point Labour would have to compromise and, at the very least, not block the deal in Parliament. Expect the prime minister to say that a vote against the deal would be thwarting the will of the people.At this point, however, Jeremy Corbyn would have a strong hand to play because the prime minister will probably not be able to pass her deal solely on the basis of Tory and DUP votes. With her fate in his hands, the Labour leader may well feel he could exact a price for allowing the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement to pass through Parliament.The Labour price could be: the party will allow the EU divorce settlement to pass in exchange for the prime minister agreeing to a general election to allow the British people to elect a government to negotiate the next stage of Brexit. That is the future partnership that will decide the UK's relationship with the EU in the decades to come.And so in the coming month Theresa May could find herself having to agree to the one thing she has been desperate to avoid (a general election) as the price for the thing she desperately needs (a withdrawal agreement with the EU). If the prime minister agreed to such a Labour request she would then have to whip her MPs to vote in favour of an early general election. At that point Sir Graham Brady may find confidence letters from Tory MPs piling up in his letter box - if such a vote has not already been held by then. And so the Brexit saga goes round in circles.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer. Subscribe to the programme on YouTube or follow them on Twitter."
2018-11-20,Can May learn from Ted Heath's tactics?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46254257,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIn four months the UK is set to leave the EU but nobody in Westminster is sure how. Parliament has seen plenty of drama during its tortured relationship with Europe but the House of Commons has never looked more fractured than it does on the brink of departure. Some MPs want to stay in the EU while others seem relaxed about leaving with no deal at all. Some want the UK to be bound as closely as possible to the continent's economy while others would be content with much looser ties. The draft withdrawal agreement the prime minister intends to put before MPs soon has been rubbished by people in all parties, including her own. The only certainty is that, somehow, Parliament must decide what happens next. Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs. And now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal.Europe was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community.After becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels. However, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons. Even though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big. But within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across. The six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971. It was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing). Unlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult.On October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote.  ""Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,"" he growled at Day. But the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move. ""Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the ""Jenkinsites"" could justify defying a  Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,"" Clarke told me.  The logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government. One of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen. ""It was typical Heath,"" Lord Owen says now. ""No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament. ""And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now."" Lord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found. According to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise. ""Both parties are shattered into fractions,"" he says. As things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes.On the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs. Although 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions. For MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter.  There are differences of course. Today, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975. There was then a binary choice between in or out. Today, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic. Nor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt. But if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons. Edward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.Listen to '71: The Vote to go In on Monday, 19 November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 - or after it has been broadcast on BBC Sounds."

CBI President John Allan will open Monday's annual conference by admitting that while the Prime Minister's deal is not perfect, it is a lot better than leaving with no deal - an outcome he will describe as a ""wrecking ball"". Mrs May, speaking later, will have the chance to sell the deal herself.She is expected to focus on how immigration will change after the UK leaves the EU, which is an area of concern for many businesses. She will say that EU nationals will no longer be able to ""jump the queue"" ahead of skilled workers from India or Australia. While business approves of the government's plans to make it easier for more high-skilled workers to come to the UK from outside the EU, business leaders are worried about her plans to make it much harder to access workers of lower skill levels. Unemployment is at historic lows and 130,000 EU nationals left the UK in the last 12 months. Competition for workers has seen welcome rises in average pay in recent months but businesses are reporting acute skills shortages in some areas, including construction. While most businesses will support Mrs May for fear of a no deal - in picking immigration as a focus, she's chosen one subject this audience has serious doubts about. "

Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"".Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 51 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. Then there are, perhaps, a further 14 Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."

2018-11-20,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-20,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121063626/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

Spain has said it will not agree to the Brexit deal unless changes are made to the wording over Gibraltar. But No 10 sources said they expected a solution before Sunday's gathering.Sources said the announcement that the PM would make an unscheduled trip to Brussels on Saturday did not signal ""major problems"" over a document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU. Mrs May spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez on Wednesday evening and said discussions would continue following ""good engagement"" between the countries and the government of Gibraltar, according to a Downing Street spokesperson.London and Brussels have already agreed the draft terms of the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March 2019 - a 585-page document covering citizens' rights, financial issues and the Irish border. While some Tory MPs want what BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described as ""nips and tucks"" to this legally-binding agreement, the UK and EU have signalled there will be no major changes. The EU is now in a race against time to complete the text of an accompanying declaration on its future relations with the UK, amid concerns from several member states.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated she will not attend Sunday's meeting of European leaders - which has been called to approve both the declaration and the withdrawal deal - unless the text on future co-operation is agreed in advance.The EU had hoped to agree the document, which is not legally binding but will be the starting point for future negotiations, first on Tuesday and then again on Wednesday.The BBC understands the ""real deadline"" in Brussels to settle it and thus ensure Sunday's summit goes ahead is now considered to be Friday morning - when ministerial negotiators meet. This was not the plan https://t.co/8R2gnXrv1mEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakAfter an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit.""We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately,"" she said.""I now plan to return for further meetings on Saturday to discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests of all our people.""What is the political declaration?Under the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement, there will be a 21-month transition period after the UK leaves lasting to the end of 2020.The future relations document sets out the basis for economic, security and defence co-operation from the start of 2021 onwards.The UK has said it hopes to agree a trade deal by then although most observers believe it will take much longer, based on other trade agreements. Please upgrade your browserWhen it was first published last Wednesday, the document was just seven pages long and has since been extended to 20 pages.In a statement on Wednesday, the UK said its objectives included a free-trade area for goods with zero tariffs on UK products, an end to membership of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy and ""ambitious arrangements for trade in services"".What is holding up the agreement?The French, Dutch and Danish governments are concerned about the amount of access their fishing fleets will get to British waters.There are broader concerns about what the Brexit agreement will mean for the future of the single market, if the UK ends up enjoying preferential access to EU markets but does not have to comply with freedom of movement rules.The other major issue is the future of Gibraltar, the British overseas territory which Spain has long laid claim to.Spain is insisting that the texts state clearly that any future trade agreements between the EU and the UK will not cover the disputed peninsula and the UK would have to hold direct negotiations with Madrid over how they applied to Gibraltar. While Spain cannot explicitly veto the deal on Sunday, the EU hopes to proceed by consensus and the BBC's Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas said it would be politically problematic for other EU countries to press ahead without Spain's support."

Here's what happened.Theresa May got a taste of what is to come if she manages to return from Brussels with a Brexit deal, as she came under fire from every Brexit faction in the Commons - and faced calls from Jeremy Corbyn to stand aside and let Labour have a go.The Labour leader zeroed in on comments by new Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" stance.He asked: ""Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?""Mrs May replied ""no"" and said the alternative to her deal would ""either be more uncertainty, more division or it could risk no Brexit at all"".""Isn't it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal,"" asked Mr Corbyn, ""and if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.""Mrs May replied: ""He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest.""Mr Corbyn then asked whether the withdrawal agreement was finalised or whether there will be changes to come.Mrs May said it was ""part of a package"" with the political declaration on the future relationship with the European Union.Mr Corbyn made time for a dig at new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, noting that Mrs May was heading to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, rather than him.He called Mr Barclay another ""non-travelling"" Brexit Secretary and wondered whether the post was now ""entirely ceremonial"". Mr Barclay managed a grin.Then it was on to the transition period, that is due to kick-in after Brexit day in March, that the business secretary said earlier this week could be extended to 2022.Mr Corbyn said it meant being outside of the EU and with no leverage. ""Does she think she is fooling anyone"" that she will get a free trade agreement by the end of 2020, asked the Labour leader.Mrs May said the future relationship document, currently the subject of intense negotiations, will set out ""the structure and scope"" of the deal.""He says there is a problem and he would do it differently,"" she went on, ""he is playing party politics, I am working in the national interest"".The prime minister had said in February that ""a border down the Irish Sea is something no UK prime minister could ever agree to"", said Mr Corbyn, so why would the backstop do just that? It wouldn't, said Mrs May.The pair repeated their attack lines before Mrs May brought their clash to an end with a declaration that ""the public gave us an instruction to leave the European Union"".Mrs May rejected a call from the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"".The prime minister branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, ""absolutely ridiculous,"" saying the public had given this Parliament ""an instruction"" to leave the EU.Tory MP Bob Neill asked about Gibraltar.Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet last week over the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement, asked whether the UK was definitely going to leave the EU on 29 March.Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:Theresa May must have felt that she picked up today where she left off on Thursday, with another rolling interrogation on Brexit. And she quickly defaulted into her weary-but-resolute mode.Backbench Brexiteer Andrew Rossindell kicked off proceedings with a direct appeal for the PM to change course on Brexit, saying her plan was not the Brexit his Romford constituents voted for. Then Jeremy Corbyn piled in with a well-targeted question picking up comments from ministers that ""no deal"" was not an option, and asking if there were any circumstances where the UK would quit the EU without a deal - a question the prime minister didn't really answer.The confusion deepened a little later, when the PM confirmed to her ex-colleague Esther McVey that the UK would leave on the appointed date of 29 March - which at least implied that this was possible without a deal, and also seemed to pull back from previous warnings that failing to back her proposed Brexit deal risked ""no Brexit at all"".Another important moment came when the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds confirmed that his party's relations with the government remain in the deep freeze, when he asked a hostile question about the disappearance of a government promise that the people of Northern Ireland would have the final say on any divergence from the UK's single market. You could hear the acid drip as he asked: ""Did she press the delete button?""  No sign of kissing and making up there. And that matters because it is hard to see how the PM's deal gets through the Commons without Mr Dodds and his troops (now restored to full strength with the return from suspension of Ian Paisley Jr).It was a noisy session but I was expecting it to be noisier still. Part of the reason may be that the big-name Brexiteers who have been trying to unseat the PM did not intervene, which would surely have produced cheers and jeers aplenty (Jacob Rees-Mogg was in the chamber, but did not attempt to speak and left before the end of the session). Another factor is that neither of the two main players was able to sound a clear trumpet note to their troops.  Jeremy Corbyn was in an excellent position to call for a second referendum, but clearly had no intention of doing so, and his mainly-Remainer MPs were not, therefore, delighted.We already know that Theresa May's deal has not exactly delighted Conservative MPs either (even the ones who support it) and a series of questions on the details (Bob Neill on Gibraltar, George Freeman on Northern Ireland, Neil Parish on agriculture) caught the wary mood on the Tory benches. It seemed to me that the two leaders were both better at attacking each other than defending their own positions, which meant that a lot of time was taken up with accusations of ""more muddled than thou"". But the bottom line is that it is now close to impossible - in the absence of any overriding mega-event - to talk about anything but Brexit at PMQs. "

Failing that, he said, there should be a general election and the final option would be another EU referendum.Theresa May is heading to Brussels for talks with EU leaders and is hoping they will finalise the Brexit withdrawal agreement on Sunday. MPs will then get a vote on the deal.As things stand, it appears there is no majority for Mrs May's deal in the Commons - but ministers hope enough MPs will swing behind it to get it through because the only alternative is no deal or ""no Brexit"".Labour and the other opposition parties are trying to find a way to present MPs with other options.Mr McDonnell said there could be a series of votes and it was ""very difficult to predict"" what the final outcome would be - but, echoing Conservative cabinet minister Amber Rudd, he said he did not think there was a majority for a no-deal Brexit.Speaking at Reuters event in London, he said it was ""difficult to see"" how there could be a general election - which Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has long insisted is his preferred option - at the moment because it would require two-thirds of MPs to back it under the Fixed Term Parliament Act.He said: ""My own view is we haven't explored sufficiently, neither has the media, these concepts, the constitution, our custom and practice, ""If it's a minority government and they can't obtain a majority in parliament, usually it's then the right, the duty of the Monarch to offer to the Opposition the opportunity to form a government and that would be a minority government, and see if they can secure a majority in parliament. ""I think we can secure a majority in parliament for some of the proposals we're putting forward.""He said opposition parties were normally asked to form a government when a minority government was losing votes in the House of Commons.This was already happening as the Democratic Unionist Party withdrew its support for Mrs May in Budget votes in protest at her EU withdrawal agreement, he said.""However, I think the test is whether the government is losing consistent votes on the issue of the deal itself,"" he argued. In that case, he argued, Labour should be given a chance to try and get a majority for its plans.""Failing that I think a general election is the route we need, and obviously, if we can't secure that then a further referendum.""At the moment Labour was working an amendments to the meaningful vote, that will give MPs an ""opportunity to avoid no deal at all costs - and I think there is a vast majority of MPs that would support that"".He said he hoped ""to demonstrate over the next couple of weeks that there is a consensus in Parliament for a new approach"". The shadow chancellor was sceptical about the chances of Brexit being stopped by another referendum, as some of his party's own MPs in the People's Vote campaign are hoping.""My fear is that if we did have another referendum, we might get the same or similar result and the country will still be divided. Somehow we have got to try and bring the country back together again.""If there was another referendum, putting the option of staying in the EU on the ballot paper should be ""part of the discussion"", he told the event.He said Labour would seek to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which he said would remove the need for a Northern Ireland ""backstop"" that has caused so much controversy."

Asked if the summit could be cancelled, Downing Street said the agenda had been published and it ""looked forward to attending"". Before heading for Brussels, Mrs May came under fire from every Brexit faction in the House of Commons at a noisy Prime Minister's Questions - from those who want another referendum, to those who want Britain to leave the EU without a deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn zeroed in on comments by new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" stance.He asked: ""Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?"" Mrs May replied ""no"" and said the alternative to her deal would ""either be more uncertainty, more division or"", in what looks like the emerging new emphasis from her government, ""it could risk no Brexit at all"".Mr Corbyn said that ""if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will"".Mrs May replied: ""He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest.""Mrs May also rejected a call from the SNP's Ian Blackford to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"".And she branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, ""absolutely ridiculous,"" saying the public had given this Parliament ""an instruction"" to leave the EU.Amber Rudd earlier said Parliament would not accept a no-deal Brexit.She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's my view that parliament, the House of Commons, will stop no deal. There isn't a majority in the House of Commons for that to take place.""Asked if she would back another referendum, like some of her fellow Remain-voting Tory MPs on the backbenches, Ms Rudd said: ""I don't think we are looking at another referendum.""She said MPs would ""take a careful look over the abyss"" and decide it was in the ""best interests of the country"" to vote for Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement.The 585-page document focuses on the terms of the UK's departure and not on any permanent future relationship. It includes how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill), details of the transition period and citizens' rights.It also covers the so-called ""backstop"", a last-resort option to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event the UK leaves the EU without securing a trade deal. It would avoid the need for bringing back physical border checks.The backstop would involve a temporary single customs territory, encompassing Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - until both the EU and UK agree that it is no longer necessary.Critics fear the UK would continue to follow EU rules for an indefinite time without having any say over them.Two cabinet ministers have resigned over the deal, others are believed to be trying to change its wording and there has been speculation over whether a confidence vote in Theresa May's leadership could be triggered.The EU will consider the agreement at its summit on 25 November, but it is yet to be approved by Parliament.Mrs May appears to have faced down the threat of a challenge to her position from Brexiteer critics of the deal, for the time being at least.However, Tory MPs unhappy with Mrs May's handling of Brexit negotiations want much more clarity on the terms of the UK's future co-operation with the EU if they are to back the final deal - which will be put before European leaders this weekend. All sides in the Commons have warned of a ""blind Brexit"" in which the UK signs up to a series of legally-binding commitments in the draft withdrawal agreement, without similar guarantees over future trading arrangements.The withdrawal deal was agreed in principle by both Mrs May and the EU last week. It includes a £39bn ""divorce bill"" and the controversial customs ""backstop"" which keeps the UK temporarily in the EU customs union as a way of preventing the return of manned customs posts at the Irish border.However, the joint political declaration on future relations - still being drafted - would only set out the shape of the UK's trading relationship with the remaining 27-nation bloc, without any legal commitments.Any binding trade deal would still have to be thrashed out in the 21-month transition period after Britain leaves the EU on 29 March 2019.The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some UK ministers still believed there was time for a few ""nips and tucks"" to the withdrawal agreement reached in principle last week.By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editorCould this all be more about optics than nitty-gritty politics?Grumbling aside, no-one in European circles seriously thinks any EU country will refuse to sign up to the Brexit deal by end of play this weekend.They're all keen to avoid a no-deal scenario and they want to help Theresa May get the Brexit texts through a vote in the House of Commons.Engaging in last-minute political fisticuffs with the EU is arguably advantageous for Mrs May.A high-drama, climactic Brexit summit ending in a (presumably planned) late night/early morning bleary-eyed but triumphant resolution with EU leaders would allow the prime minister to claim that the final text of the deal was hard fought and hard won… in the fervent hope that will soften the stance of some of her many critics at home.Discussions in Brussels focus on the political declaration outlining relations from the scheduled end of the transition period in 2021. Currently running to 20 pages, it will sit alongside the withdrawal agreement.The BBC understands the intention is still to present a completed text to leaders at Sunday's summit but opinions differ over how easy it would be to solve the outstanding issues.Spain has warned it will reject the draft Brexit withdrawal deal without a clarification of the text on future talks on the status of Gibraltar.Spain maintains a claim to the peninsula, ceded to the British crown under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and it wants to ensure that future EU talks with the UK do not cover Gibraltar.Ambassadors from the EU's 27 remaining countries had been due to be briefed on the final text on Tuesday but the meeting has been re-scheduled for later this week."

Commonly used in Canada, the term means someone being led into a marriage without the mental capacity to consent. Presenting a private members' bill to the House of Commons, Labour MP Fabian Hamilton shared a constituent's story to highlight the issue.  ""The majority of those affected are entering second marriages and are from the older generation,"" he said. Introducing the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Consent) Bill, the Leeds North East MP said laws protecting individuals from forced marriage did not cover the required ground.Mr Hamilton mentioned Joan Blass, a 91-year-old with vascular dementia who married a man 24 years younger than her a year before her death.Parliament heard Mrs Blass met Colman Folan in 2011, the same year she was diagnosed with dementia, and it was said he moved into her home within a month of them meeting.Mr Hamilton said Mrs Blass died of cancer in March 2016, with her family only learning Mrs Blass had married Mr Folan after she had passed away. The Commons heard Mrs Blass' daughter Daphne Franks, from Gledhow in Leeds, told Mr Hamilton ""no family member or friend had been told about the secret marriage ceremony"".""Joan had made a will some years before meeting Colman, but Daphne discovered to her surprise and shock that a marriage automatically revokes a previous will,"" Mr Hamilton said. ""Colman now had complete control over Joan's estate, in spite of the fact that Daphne previously had Power of Attorney on behalf of her mother during her lifetime.""In a statement given to BBC Radio 4 on behalf of Mr Folan in March, his relationship with Mrs Blass was described as ""long, loving and caring"".It read: ""I was not made aware by Mrs Franks, her family or Mrs Blass' GP of any concerns they had about her capacity or a diagnosis of dementia.  ""The registrars who performed the marriage ceremony believed Mrs Blass had capacity to enter into marriage.""It added: ""Mrs Blass wanted to marry me and I believed at the time, and still do, that she has capacity to make that decision for herself.""Proposed changesConcluding the Ten Minute Rule Bill, Mr Hamilton said: ""It is not good enough for a registrar simply to say that because one of the participants in a marriage ceremony was smiling at the time, that meant consent was happily given. ""Much of the anecdotal evidence suggests that Joan had no idea she had ever been married to Folan and that there was clear evidence her mental capacity was severely reduced in the last years of her life.""He believed the case ""has profound implications for many hundreds of other families who may find themselves in a similar situation across the country"".The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Folan again in light of the MP's comments in the House of Commons. The bill will have a second reading in Parliament on 25 January. "
2018-11-21,Government borrowing worse than expected,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46287887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government borrowed far more than analysts expected in October, the first figures to be published since Philip Hammond's Budget last month show.The deficit rose to £8.8bn from £7.2bn last year, marking the biggest October figure for three years, and well above the £6.1bn forecast.However, the amount borrowed so far this financial year is the lowest for 13 years. The figures come after the chancellor said austerity was coming to an end. The Office for National Statistics said the current year-to-date borrowing was £26.7bn, which is £11.2bn less than the same period last year and the lowest since 2005.During his budget announcement the Chancellor also said borrowing is likely to fall over the next five years. A Treasury spokesperson said it was the government's best year-to-date performance since 2005, adding ""our balanced approach is getting debt falling while supporting our vital public services, keeping taxes low, and investing in Britain's future"".The ONS said there had been  ""notable"" growth in expenditure on goods and services, as well as social benefits. Interest payments on government debt also increased.""The increase in borrowing compared to last year was due to a £2.2bn rise in ""other"" (most likely departmental) spending,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.Mr Wishart said the October figures could be a ""worrying sign for the Chancellor"" if the trend continued.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was to soon to conclude that the Chancellor would miss the official forecast for borrowing this year.He points out that the data is often revised and ""the Chancellor won't need to respond to a modest overshoot"".The nature of the UK's exit from the European Union, is likely to have an impact on the nation's finances.In October, the Chancellor said that a good Brexit agreement would enable the Treasury to spend a ""double deal dividend"".However, a no deal scenario could upset government spending plans, economists say. ""If there is a no deal Brexit, the resulting economic slowdown would probably cause the public finances to deteriorate further,"" Mr Wishart said."
2018-11-21,What to look for in Brexit declaration?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46278361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU and UK are poised to complete the document that will spell out the shape of their future post-Brexit relationship and pave the way for a trade deal. The Political Declaration on the future framework will sit alongside the Withdrawal Agreement that settles the terms of the UK's departure, but the declaration will not be legally binding. A seven-page outline has been published. BBC Brussels Reporter Adam Fleming explains what to look for in the final version.  Discussions in Brussels about how many pages will be in the document are like a game of bingo. ""50! 14! 16! 20!"" Whatever the length, it has to be detailed enough to satisfy the UK and the EU. It has to offer the UK a vision of the future that will convince MPs to accept the divorce-related part of the deal.For the EU, it has to provide guidance to steer the negotiations about the future relationship, which will begin in earnest after Brexit. Their watchword is ""precision"". Expect it to cover a lot of sectors, such as trade, aviation, financial services, energy, crime. The EU's original plan was to publish the outline in October and then spend a month filling in the details with the UK, while consulting the member states. The timetable slipped, so that's now happening in about a week instead. Last week the EU's top negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the biggest areas of disagreement were trade and security. Britain is said to be asking for the political declaration to reflect Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for a UK/EU free trade area in goods, with a common rulebook. Some EU countries think that's too similar to being a member. The EU also isn't prepared - so far - to continue the status quo on security. This includes co-operation on extradition and access to European databases. Language is being sought to ensure everyone can claim they got what they wanted. Both sides have agreed that the EU will apply its existing system for judging whether the financial services regulations of other countries are as good as its own, known as ""equivalence"". We might find out if the UK has succeeded in getting some additional safeguards in the equivalence regime that could help out the City of London. Or we might not. In the last few days the other 27 member states have raised concerns about some areas and asked for clarification. France leads a group of countries that want more clarity on the so-called ""level-playing field"" - measures that would put constraints on the UK in return for easy access to the single market, such as compliance with EU competition, environmental and social law. Belgium, Denmark, Portugal and others want to reinforce the EU's policy that European trawlers should have continued access to British waters in return for the UK being allowed to sell its fish in Europe.The Spanish government wants reassurance about the extent to which the future relationship will apply to Gibraltar. Some of these issues may be addressed in documents that accompany the political declaration, for example in the minutes of the meeting of EU leaders. Yes, more documents!One sentence in the outline version caught my eye. It said the ""extent of the UK's commitments on customs and regulatory co-operation, including with regard to the alignment of rules, to be taken into account in the application of checks and controls at the border.""This is code for a sliding scale of frictionless trade. The message is: ""Apply EU rules and sign up to something that looks like a customs union, then there will be many fewer checks on the millions of trucks that go through Calais.""It means the internal argument the UK has had about rules, regulations and customs will continue well into the negotiations on the future. This section is called ""institutional arrangements"". It proposes that the UK/EU relationship is managed via a series of ministerial meetings and prime ministerial summits.Yes, a bit like the EU. It will also contain clues about how the next phase of talks will unfold. For me, it's the most important part because it will decide what I'll be doing for at least the next three years. "

The truth is that SNP plans just make a no deal Brexit more likely.""Ms Sturgeon also admitted she has not yet found common ground with Labour over an alternative Brexit deal after meeting UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn.She held talks with Mr Corbyn in Westminster to try to coalesce around another way forward but said ""we're not there yet"".She said she wanted to see a ""coalition of opposition"" over the draft Brexit deal after speaking to Mr Corbyn.And she said there was a ""strong willingness"" among the opposition parties to work together.Ms Sturgeon and Mr Corbyn have both criticised Prime Minister Theresa May's draft Brexit agreement, which was published last week.Mrs May argues that the plan is the only realistic chance of avoiding a ""no deal"" Brexit.But there has been widespread criticism of the draft 585-page withdrawal agreement and the short paper setting out what the UK and EU's future relationship could look like. Two of the prime minister's cabinet ministers have resigned - including her Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab - while others are believed to be trying to change its wording, and there has been talk of a Tory leadership challenge.Ms Sturgeon, who says she wants to find a ""workable alternative"" to the deal, held ""exploratory"" talks with Mr Corbyn, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Roberts, ahead of her meeting with the prime minister.She told the BBC there was agreement with Mr Corbyn that the prime minister's deal was a bad one, and that no deal should not be the only alternative.The first minister added: ""The next stages of all of this have to be to look at what we can coalesce around in terms of alternatives"".She also claimed that momentum for another referendum on Brexit was growing. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn's meeting with Ms Sturgeon had been ""constructive"", with the pair discussing their ""common opposition"" to the draft Brexit agreement and their ""determination to work across parliament to prevent a disastrous no-deal outcome.""Ms Sturgeon has already said the 35 SNP MPs will vote against the deal in the House of Commons and has accused the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" between the agreement and a no-deal Brexit. The first minister has called for continued, permanent single market and customs union membership for the whole of the UK as an alternative, and has been highly critical of the ""backstop"" proposals for Northern Ireland, which she has said could have a ""devastating"" impact on jobs and investment in Scotland if they are enacted. The UK's four farming unions, including NFU Scotland, have given their support to Mrs May's draft EU withdrawal agreement, saying it was ""not perfect"" but would allow trade in agricultural goods, as well as food and drink, to continue largely as before.  And Mrs May's defacto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, last week urged Ms Sturgeon to ""listen to what Scottish business is saying"" and back the agreement.He added: ""Scottish business is lining up with business throughout the UK to say we want a deal. It will give us clarity, certainty - we can plan, we can count on investment, we can decide upon jobs staying in Scotland. ""The way in which to put prosperity and jobs in Scotland at risk is to prolong the uncertainty rather than to take the ambitious, good, compromise deal that is on offer.""On Monday, the prime minister tried to persuade business leaders that the deal offered the best way forward, saying it would stop EU migrants from being able to ""jump the queue"".She told the CBI conference in London that migration would become skills-based, with Europeans no longer prioritised over ""engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi"".Ms Sturgeon later tweeted that she believed the prime minister's choice of words was ""offensive"" and ""disgraceful"".Mr Corbyn told the same conference that Brexit could be a ""catalyst for economic transformation"" in the UK. Labour has said its priority is to secure a general election, and has argued that there is still time to secure a better Brexit deal."

2018-11-21,What's Hunt doing in Iran?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46276608,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowJeremy Hunt's visit to Tehran comes amid tensions between the two countries over UK dual nationals detained in Iran, and the war in Yemen.There is an old joke in diplomatic circles that Iran is the only country in the world that still thinks the United Kingdom is a great power.Instead of viewing the UK as a middling-sized European country, senior Iranian figures have seen a post-imperial nation still bent on meddling in the Middle East, exerting its exaggerated influence across the region. This is in part a reflection of Iran's lingering resentment of Britain's role in helping to depose an elected prime minister here in the 1950s. It also reflects the UK's close relationship with the United States, a country with which Iran seems to be in a permanent state of confrontation. So when Jeremy Hunt arrived in Tehran this week for his first visit as foreign secretary, he was not ignored. He had a long meeting and lunch with his counterpart, the veteran foreign minister Javad Zarif. He was also granted a rare meeting with the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, a powerful figure in Iran's military. Iranian media packed in to film him, and his visit made the local papers. (I am sorry to report that this does not happen everywhere a British foreign secretary goes these days.)This attention on Mr Hunt, though, was not just because of Iran's historic perspective of the UK. It was also because right now Iran needs the UK's help.Since the United States withdrew from the deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and re-imposed sanctions, Iran has been desperate to protect its trade with Europe.Britain and the EU have promised to help but are struggling to find ways of encouraging European firms to continue doing business with Iran. Many firms are pulling out for fear of US fines and loss of trade. There is a plan for the EU to set up a special financial system that would allow Iran to barter its oil exports in a way that could avoid US sanctions. But nothing is happening quickly, and many doubt it will work. Foreign Minister Zarif told me: ""We need to see some action. We welcome the political commitment from the UK and (other European countries) but we believe that political commitment needs to be followed by action.""The Iranians can be phlegmatic about the impact of US sanctions. Officials here frequently refer back to the way Iran coped with its eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, when more than half a million Iranians died. Analysts speak of Iran's ""resilience economy"". But even Mr Zarif admits to me that these new sanctions will hurt: ""Ordinary people will suffer, our economy is going to suffer.""So this was the context of Mr Hunt's visit and it was a fair diplomatic wind he appeared determined to use to deliver some key messages. Much of his focus, inevitably, was the fate of British-Iranian nationals such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who have been detained by the regime. The foreign secretary was outspoken in threatening consequences for Iran if they were not released. But Mr Zarif said he was not in a position to discuss the legality of such cases, because they were the result of decisions made by Iran's judiciary.Mr Hunt tried to see a senior judge yesterday, but after much coming and going, the meeting failed to materialise. I asked Mr Zarif why Iran could not release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe -  not only to correct a gross injustice, but also to improve relations between the UK and Iran. The answer that he could not give me is that there are some Iranian hardliners who want nothing of the sort and are using the detained British dual nationals deliberately to sour diplomatic relations. And until that changes, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's fate remains bleak. The real diplomatic focus of Mr Hunt's trip was his push for an end to the fighting in Yemen. Iran plays a key role here as the international backer of the Houthi rebels, providing them with money and missiles, according to the US, something Iran denies.The foreign secretary urged Iran to encourage the Houthis to come to the UN-backed talks in Stockholm later this month to see if a cessation of hostilities can be agreed and a political process begun. Mr Hunt is cautious, telling me that ""both sides don't trust each other further than they can throw each other."" But he was also optimistic that confidence-building measures could gradually bring the Saudis and the Houthis to the table. Britain is in charge of the negotiations at the UN in New York, and is circulating a new resolution to this end. The problem here in Tehran is that the Iranians do not think the Saudi-led coalition, which is fighting the Houtis, is going far enough. The Saudis have agreed to stop targeting civilian areas in Yemen. But Foreign Minister Zarif told me that this had too many loopholes, and Saudi Arabia should stop all its military operations. Otherwise it could carry on launching air strikes and just claim it was not targeting civilian areas. The fact that Mr Hunt pressed ahead with this trip despite the political turmoil in Britain - and at the risk of angering US allies - reflects the importance he places in improving Britain's relations with Iran and landing some key messages, particularly on Yemen. He told me that Iran is one of the great historic civilisations in the world that, like Russia, is desperate for international respect but is going about it in the wrong way. He said it had to end what he regarded as disruptive behaviour in the region. The problem is that analysis is not shared by everyone in Tehran and Washington. The hardliners here project their country's power through military force and proxy political support in places like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. And hardliners in the Trump administration see Iran as the world's greatest sponsor of terrorism, a country bent on securing nuclear weapons. And for now, some modest diplomacy from a middling-sized European power is not going to change that hard reality."
2018-11-21,Choppy waters,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46264303,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU 27 are concerned that ""taking back control"" of the UK's waters might mean fewer fishing opportunities for their fleets. A diplomatic note - seen by the BBC - raised concerns about access and environmental commitments.The prospect might be a surprise to them, focused on 585 pages of draft agreements, but it's been the backbone of the economic argument for the UK's most pro-Brexit industry. Many have said it would be the litmus-test of the whole process.  The waters around all the EU's member states, up to a limit of 200 miles, are effectively ""pooled"" when it comes to fishing.  It means boats from one country can fish in another's seas. When the UK leaves the EU, barring any new agreements, those waters will exclusively become the UK's again, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.There's also a further separate international agreement, called the London Fisheries Convention, covering the 12 miles closest to the shore. It's being terminated, meaning no foreign vessel will be allowed to fish in UK waters without the UK's permission. A long-running fear among skippers has been that their fishing rights would be ""traded away"" in deals done for the benefit of more economically valuable sectors. The draft withdrawal agreement seems to rule that out but it doesn't mean foreign boats will be immediately chased away by British vessels.  None of the industry bodies has advocated allowing only UK boats to fish in our exclusive economic zone - the sea up to 200 miles from UK shores. What they want is for the UK - or the nations of the UK - to decide who is and isn't allowed in.When Greenland left the EU, in 1982, it allowed limited access to its waters in exchange for infrastructure funding. Greenland initially held all the quotas for its exclusive seas but effectively sold off some.A similar negotiation is proposed between the UK and EU but there is no commitment to reaching a deal. The document simply says the two parties will ""use their best endeavours"" to do so.There will have to be flexibility as British boats don't just fish in British waters. The recent scallop skirmishes in the Baie de Seine, which resulted in tussles at sea between French and British fishermen in a row over access to fishing grounds, illustrated the need for cross-border cooperation.  The fishing industry in towns such as Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Grimsby will see Brexit as a success only if their harbours are filled with more local boats in the years ahead.  Important too is the link being made between fishing opportunities for EU vessels and the sale of fish and seafood by the UK into the EU.  It's unlikely the prominence of fishing will crumble in the wider noise of securing a trade deal, mainly because most of the industry is in Scotland.The block of 13 Scottish Conservative MPs, including the Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, have repeatedly taken a tough collective stance with the prime minister over the issue, only last week restating that it would be a ""betrayal"" if the EU retained any control over fishing rights.Those 13 Tories have a stronger voting power than the 10 DUP members keeping Theresa May in office.And looming over all this is the threat of a second referendum on Scottish independence. It would be of great political benefit to the SNP if it was able to claim the fleet had been ""let down by Westminster"" on fishing.Of course, a general election could change the dynamic entirely but short of that its difficult to see any radical shift.As for the environmental concerns, annually the quotas for fishing catches are based on scientific advice. That is, scientists prescribe how much of each stock - cod, haddock et cetera - can be caught sustainably. It then becomes a political negotiation over how to divide up the stock between countries.It's difficult to argue with the scientists - although many often do.But if the UK decides to conduct its own scientific research - and that contradicts the European Commission's - the negotiations could become sticky.Until not so long ago, Iceland had a long running dispute with the EU over its rights to fish for mackerel when its own scientists detected changes in their migration patterns.But because it was an independent coastal state, it held many of the cards and eventually secured a much larger share of the catch.  It had muscle and used it.So, should the EU 27 feel concerned about future fishing opportunities being restricted?  We don't know the answer yet. A lot is at stake - from fishing rights to market access  - and so, the negotiations will be complex."
2018-11-21,Property gamble?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46287924,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAt Brunswick House in Cambridge students can rent a large en-suite room, sharing a kitchen with five others, for £183 a week.With more than 200 rooms, and a ready supply of potential tenants, it's an investor's dream. But the students who live there don't pay their rent to a commercial investor.In fact, it goes to Cambridgeshire County Council, which has just bought the building for £38m.The council is upfront about why it's bought the building - it is ""an investment opportunity to fund our frontline services,"" says Cllr Joshua Schumann, chairman of the council's commercial and investment committee. He says the purchase ""is about us making sure that as budget pressures become more challenging, we have the money to support the most vulnerable members of our community"".And Cambridgeshire isn't alone when it comes to investing in commercial property. Two years ago Spelthorne Council in Surrey spent £365m buying BP's headquarters. Earlier this year it spent another £170m on an office block in west London. Meanwhile Stockport Council bought a large shopping centre in 2016 for £80m.Across England, the amount councils have spent on acquiring land and buildings has shot up from about £1bn in 2015/16, to £4bn last year. This year councils expect that figure to rise again, to £5bn. Much of that money will be spent acquiring commercial property, financed through cheap loans from the Public Works Loan Board.Cambridgeshire's purchase of Brunswick House has come about through some complicated financial engineering - the council has borrowed £100m at government-backed interest rates of about 2%, well below market rates. It has loaned that money to a company it owns called This Land. This Land is using that loan to buy council-owned land, on which it will build houses. And so the council gets the money back as a capital receipt which it uses to invest in buildings like Brunswick House. Cllr Steve Count, the council's Conservative leader, says he's proud to lead a council that looks for ""financial solutions"". He points out that by using the loan in the way it is, the council gets two income streams - interest on the loan it's made to This Land, and rents from Brunswick House.""Anybody looking at this with a financial background will understand it's not just complicated, it's actually great use of public funds,"" he says. ""What we are managing to do is use public funds in a multitude of different ways delivering on a multitude of objectives. ""This is a council not complicating matters but utilising funds to the very best of their ability. And we're very good at that.""But the body that regulates local authority financial managers is concerned about the scale of borrowing across England. Last month, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) wrote to every council in England, reminding them of rules that ban them from borrowing to invest for purely commercial purposes.Don Peebles, CIPFA's head of policy and technical, says that ""by taking a disproportionate level of borrowing, councils are perhaps opening themselves up to a level of risk that has not necessarily been identified"".And he warns that because income streams from commercial property are not guaranteed, but the debt will need to be repaid, councils are opening themselves up to ""a longer term risk"".The councils do, however, have their supporters. Paul Hackett is the director of the Smith Institute, a think tank that focuses on housing, regeneration, public services and local growth. He argues commercial investments can do more than just prop up an authority's finances.""A lot of councils in the North or Midlands are struggling to kick start things where values are not so high, where the market is not so active,"" he says. ""Sometimes there's nothing else to be done but for the council to take a risk and get involved. Particularly when it comes to regeneration, where many councils are frustrated that things aren't happening, maybe they feel the risk is worth the potential reward.""In Cambridgeshire, however, the reward is clear. Each student living at Brunswick House contributes six times more to the county's coffers than the average council tax payer."

The Labour leader wants a general election which will only happen with Tory acquiescence.Their joint need for each to reach their respective goals means that the pair may have to make compromises which, at the moment, appear unthinkable. But it may be the price they have to pay for survival - in the prime minister's case - and for a route to No 10 in the case of the Labour leader.For the moment, we will hear the prime minister saying she will not cut any deals with other parties in the run up to the ""meaningful vote"" in Parliament. She will say the parties should do as she has done in the Brexit negotiations and simply act in the national interest to vote for her deal to avoid no deal or no Brexit.For his part, Jeremy Corbyn will say that Labour will vote down the prime minister's deal on the grounds that it fails the party's six Brexit tests. Labour believes it is on strong ground here because sources say Michel Barnier has indicated to the party that the EU would be prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal if another UK government found itself in office following a rejection of the current deal in Parliament.Downing St hopes those Labour dreams will be quashed on Sunday if EU leaders endorse the Brexit deal at a summit in Brussels. No 10 is hoping that the likes of Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker will say the withdrawal agreement has been finalised and cannot be reopened.No 10 is also hoping that at this point Labour would have to compromise and, at the very least, not block the deal in Parliament. Expect the prime minister to say that a vote against the deal would be thwarting the will of the people.At this point, however, Jeremy Corbyn would have a strong hand to play because the prime minister will probably not be able to pass her deal solely on the basis of Tory and DUP votes. With her fate in his hands, the Labour leader may well feel he could exact a price for allowing the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement to pass through Parliament.The Labour price could be: the party will allow the EU divorce settlement to pass in exchange for the prime minister agreeing to a general election to allow the British people to elect a government to negotiate the next stage of Brexit. That is the future partnership that will decide the UK's relationship with the EU in the decades to come.And so in the coming month Theresa May could find herself having to agree to the one thing she has been desperate to avoid (a general election) as the price for the thing she desperately needs (a withdrawal agreement with the EU). If the prime minister agreed to such a Labour request she would then have to whip her MPs to vote in favour of an early general election. At that point Sir Graham Brady may find confidence letters from Tory MPs piling up in his letter box - if such a vote has not already been held by then. And so the Brexit saga goes round in circles.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer. Subscribe to the programme on YouTube or follow them on Twitter."
2018-11-21,Can May learn from Ted Heath's tactics?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46254257,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIn four months the UK is set to leave the EU but nobody in Westminster is sure how. Parliament has seen plenty of drama during its tortured relationship with Europe but the House of Commons has never looked more fractured than it does on the brink of departure. Some MPs want to stay in the EU while others seem relaxed about leaving with no deal at all. Some want the UK to be bound as closely as possible to the continent's economy while others would be content with much looser ties. The draft withdrawal agreement the prime minister intends to put before MPs soon has been rubbished by people in all parties, including her own. The only certainty is that, somehow, Parliament must decide what happens next. Just as it did in October 1971 when another Conservative prime minister with a meagre majority and a divided party presented his Europe deal to MPs. And now, as then, a free vote of MPs - where they can vote with their conscience rather than following the orders of party bosses - could be the only way to unlock a Commons majority for a deal.Europe was almost a religion for Edward Heath, whose driving political ambition was to take Britain into what was then the six-member European Economic Community.After becoming prime minister in 1970, he quickly set about winning over the French (who had vetoed British membership twice before) and negotiating the terms of entry with Brussels. However, with a slim Commons majority of around 30 and many anti-EEC Tories in his own ranks, there was no guarantee Heath could get his deal through the Commons. Even though the then Labour leader Harold Wilson had submitted the UK's application for membership only four years before, now back in opposition Wilson set his own divided party against the deal Heath had negotiated, claiming the terms were not good enough and that the government had no mandate for a decision so big. But within Labour's ranks were dozens of pro-European MPs, including the deputy leader Roy Jenkins, and it was clear the Conservative government would need their support to counter-balance the Tory rebels. The question was how to lure them across. The six-day debate about the terms of entry was scheduled for the end of October 1971. It was dubbed the Great Debate at the time and the official record reveals a Parliament grappling with the impact of entry on sovereignty and Britain's place in the world (as well as the effect on food prices, farming and fishing). Unlike today, there was a broad consensus in the Commons that joining the EEC was a sensible and pragmatic move, but with the Labour front bench imposing a three line whip against entry harnessing that view would be difficult.On October 11, Heath was interviewed by Robin Day on the BBC's Panorama programme and the prime minister (a former Tory Chief Whip himself) seemed strongly opposed to the idea of relaxing the mechanism for enforcing party discipline in parliament that would be required for a free vote.  ""Every government is entitled to ask its own supporters to support it on a major issue such as this. You can't argue it isn't a major issue,"" he growled at Day. But the team of Tory whips, which included a young Ken Clarke, knew a free vote of their own MPs could prove a decisive tactical move. ""Ted had to be persuaded by his chief whip Francis Pym to allow a free vote of Tory MPs because that was the only way that the ""Jenkinsites"" could justify defying a  Labour three line whip so it was not a betrayal of the cause,"" Clarke told me.  The logic was a free vote of Conservative MPs would take the heat out of the issue and stop it being a vote of confidence in the government. One of the Labour rebels was then Labour MP David Owen. ""It was typical Heath,"" Lord Owen says now. ""No sensitivity at all to the House of Commons. No sensitivity that this was an issue which you should try to carry through with all Members of Parliament. ""And exactly the same thing is being done by Theresa May now."" Lord Owen is now a Brexiteer. Ken Clarke is certainly not. But they both agree the only way a withdrawal deal can pass the Commons is for a cross-party majority to be found. According to Clarke, the Europe issue has divided both main parties since the debate first broke out and it's absurd to pretend otherwise. ""Both parties are shattered into fractions,"" he says. As things currently stand, there seems to be a majority in the House of Commons against Theresa May's proposed EU withdrawal deal, according to the BBC's senior elections and political analyst Peter Barnes.On the eve of the debate in 1971, Edward Heath was persuaded by his whips to allow a free vote of Tory MPs. Although 39 Conservative MPs did oppose EEC entry at the Commons vote on 28 October, 69 Labour MPs voted for Europe and another 20 abstained, giving Heath's government a majority of 112, far exceeding most predictions. For MPs on both sides of the debate it was a once-in-a-generation vote that forced them to juggle considerations of personal judgment, party loyalty and the views of their voters - precisely the same pressures that will be on MPs' minds this winter.  There are differences of course. Today, a referendum result looms over MPs - it didn't then. A referendum on whether Britain should stay in the EEC, as it was then called, followed in 1975. There was then a binary choice between in or out. Today, a number of scenarios could follow the rejection of Theresa May's deal and the politics feels far more chaotic. Nor does it seem there are anywhere near enough potential Labour rebels to counterbalance the likely Conservative revolt. But if the government is to have a chance of getting a withdrawal agreement passed in the teeth of opposition from Tory Brexiteers and the Labour front bench it will need to tap support from elsewhere in the Commons. Edward Heath decided a free vote of his own MPs was the best way to that. Some in Westminster are now saying that Theresa could learn something from Ted.Listen to '71: The Vote to go In on Monday, 19 November at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 - or after it has been broadcast on BBC Sounds."

2018-11-21,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-21,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181121234836/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have come up with a draft withdrawal agreement. This covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - what happens to the Northern Ireland border and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A separate and much shorter draft statement on future relations has also been agreed. To buy more time, the two sides have agreed on a 21-month ""transition"" period to smooth the way to post-Brexit relations. The UK cabinet will discuss the text on Wednesday. If they give the go ahead there should be an EU summit at the end of November to agree to it. It would then be up to the UK parliament and EU member states to each ratify the agreement, before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020, to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.No. Both sides hope they can agree by the end of November an outline of how things like trade, travel and security will work. If all goes to plan this deal could then be given the go-ahead by both sides in time for 29 March 2019. Theresa May's cabinet had a wide variety of views on Brexit - from those who opposed Brexit, to those who led the Leave campaign during the referendum. Getting them all to agree on a vision for the future has been quite a challenge. To do so, Mrs May invited her cabinet ministers to Chequers, her official country house in Buckinghamshire, in July to thrash out their differences and agree a plan. The plan includes proposals for the UK to mirror EU rules on goods, plus the UK and EU being treated as a ""combined customs territory"" which would mean the UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. The idea is that this would avoid the need for a visible border with the Republic of Ireland.The plan suggests that the UK would also be free to strike its own trade deals with countries around the world, something it is currently unable to do as a member of the EU customs union.Mrs May says the plan will also end the free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". But a ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts. But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"".Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"".At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit planThe initial reaction was not positive - Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis both resigned a couple of days after the plan was agreed at Chequers. And it has not gained much support since then. Both those who oppose Brexit and those who want a clean break with the EU are unhappy with what is seen as a compromise deal. The European Union has also said the trade parts of the proposals are unacceptable. Mrs May has so far stuck by the plan, saying it is a workable one which takes on board both the UK and EU's red lines, is the best possible one for the UK and EU economies and avoids the need for a visible border on the island of Ireland. Read more: Laura Kuenssberg on the fallout from EU rejection of Chequers PlanEuropean Council President Donald Tusk's rejected the Chequers plan at an EU summit in Salzburg, Austria, in September, leading to increased speculation that the UK could leave the EU without a deal. Mrs May has always insisted that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but, like the EU, she says a deal would be the best option for everyone. The government has started planning for a no-deal scenario, while stressing it is unlikely. It has published a series of guides for industry, covering everything from pet passports to the impact on consumer protection laws and electricity supplies in Northern Ireland. The M26 in Kent has been closed overnight to prepare for possible queues of lorries at Dover. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal, but some Conservative MPs are arguing for a ""clean break"" with the EU. They say warnings of chaos in the event of a no-deal Brexit are scaremongering.The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The EU's solution was to set up a ""common regulatory area"" after Brexit on the island of Ireland - in effect keeping Northern Ireland in an EU customs union - if no other solution is found during trade talks. Theresa May says this would threaten to split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK - something she, and the Democratic Unionist Party, would never accept.She says her Chequers plan would solve the problem by establishing a ""common rulebook"" for food and manufactured goods flowing between the EU and UK, with no need for regulatory checks at the border. Customs declarations and VAT checks could be done electronically, so there would be no need for a physical border. The EU does not like her Chequers plan, however.The UK has also proposed its own temporary ""backstop"" arrangement if a new customs system is not ready in time by the end of the transition period. The backstop proposal in the draft EU withdrawal agreement is believed to avoid a return to a ""hard border"" by keeping the UK as a whole aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time.Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, by 56% to 44%.The key thing to remember about the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is that it is a last resort - if all goes as planned it will never be used. The two sides want to protect an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without having agreed a solution as part of trade negotiations.They do not agree on what this safety net should look like, however. The EU has suggested Northern Ireland stays aligned with its trade rules so new border checks are not needed. But Theresa May has said this would undermine the integrity of the UK, by creating a new border in the Irish Sea.She has suggested the UK as a whole could remain aligned with the EU customs union for a limited time after 2020, when the planned transition period ends. This is the solution in the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Some Tory Brexiteers say the backstop is not necessary at all because technological solutions can avoid a hard border.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue. Mr Corbyn also insists he could persuade Brussels to let the UK have a say in its rules post-Brexit. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March. This would enable Labour to head to Brussels with its Brexit proposals to try to get a deal. The 27 EU nations would have to agree to this.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab is the new Brexit secretary and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. But Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations.  Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve whatever deal the UK and the rest of the EU agree at the end of the two year process. This vote was proposed as a ""take it or leave it"" one, after the deal was done.But Mrs May suffered her first defeat as PM in December 2017 when enough Tory rebels joined with opposition parties to back an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which puts into law the fact that any Brexit deal can only become law if MPs have voted for it. In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding and the withdrawal agreement also has to be ratified by Parliament. But the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty. Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by March 2019 but the finer details could take years to sort out. The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.So if Adrian is waiting to find out the implications for his business, then he's going to have to be patient.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

The withdrawal agreement is legally-binding - the political declaration is not.It sets out broad aspirations for the kind of relationship the UK and the EU will have after Brexit. Some of the wording of it is non-committal and allows both sides to keep their options open.""The negotiations (on the political declaration) are now at a critical moment and all our efforts must be focused on working with our European partners to bring this process to a final conclusion in the interests of all our people,"" said the PM.""The British people want Brexit to be settled, they want a good deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future, and they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS.""The deal that will enable us to do this is now within our grasp. In these crucial 72 hours ahead, I will do everything possible to deliver it for the British people."" But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the agreement as ""26 pages of waffle"" which ""could have been written two years ago"".""This is the blindfold Brexit we all feared - a leap in the dark. It falls short of Labour's six tests,"" he added. ""What on earth have the government been doing for the past two years?""Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, described it as an ""agreement to have an agreement"" that was ""full of worryingly vague aspirations"".Tensions remain over some parts of the withdrawal agreement. Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said his government is ""annoyed"" that the divorce agreement does not specify that Gibraltar's future must be decided directly by officials in Madrid and London - and France is understood to have sought amendments to the wording on fishing rights in UK waters.Mrs May said she had spoken to Mr Sanchez and was ""confident that on Sunday we will be able to agree a deal for the whole of the United Kingdom family including Gibraltar"" - and that the UK's sovereignty over the territory was not under threat.If all goes as planned, the UK and the EU will use the political declaration as the basis for a trade agreement, to be hammered out during a 21-month transition period that is due to kick-in after Brexit happens on 29 March, during which the UK will continue to be a member of the EU single market and customs union.The draft document says: ""The future relationship will be based on a balance of rights and obligations, taking into account the principles of each party. ""This balance must ensure the autonomy of the union's decision-making and be consistent with the union's principles, in particular with respect to the integrity of the single market and the customs union and the indivisibility of the four freedoms. ""It must also ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market, while respecting the result of the 2016 referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the United Kingdom.""Please upgrade your browserIn the Commons, Mrs May faced calls from Brexiteer Conservative MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP, who have threatened to vote down the deal, to ditch the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" and come forward with the alternatives set out in the political declaration instead.Opponents of Brexit were also critical of the new document.Conservative MP Philip Lee, who quit the government in protest at its handling of Brexit, said it ""reads like a letter to Santa"", while Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a new referendum, said it was ""entirely aspirational and doesn't finalise anything"".Conservatives Sir Nicholas Soames and Nick Herbert were among a handful of MPs to speak out in favour of Mrs May's deal during the debate.Scottish Conservative MPs are also concerned that the declaration will not protect the interests of the UK fishing industry.🐟The political declaration commits UK to ""establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares"". This means sovereignty over our waters sacrificed for a trade deal. That is unacceptable. We must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway. pic.twitter.com/wRCzdSNahfEnd of Twitter post  by @RossThomson_MPBut the government insists the UK's ""red lines"" on fishing have been protected, and the text acknowledges the UK will be ""an independent coastal state"" with the rights and responsibilities that entails.A government source said the EU had wanted ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources [to] be maintained"" but this had been rejected.The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said Scotland's fishing rights had been ""thrown overboard like they were discarded fish"", adding, ""so much for taking back control, more like trading away Scotland's interests"".Several EU countries have raised concerns about Mrs May's planned meeting with Mr Juncker on Saturday night, saying that it should not lead to any changes in the text.

Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.A few points to remember… This is not a legally binding document.It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come. Here's an initial look at what's in the text:A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours. Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like. And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.The bottom line of both parties is included early on. Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.So trade in goods should be ""as close as possible"", but that's not the same as being frictionless. It leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome. The two sides are committing themselves to an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement. But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition. The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit. Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world. The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"".The declaration also mentions explicitly an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK in the future.We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open. That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long. The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come. It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between. But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific. As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of ""equivalence"" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020. There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim. There are also plenty of aspirational words on ""ambitious and comprehensive"" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data. The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy. But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.This fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays. There is neutral language here, including the ""best endeavours"" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal. But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters. Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome. We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future. Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel. But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice. The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end. There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on. Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"
2018-11-22,A guide to where we are with Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has agreed a draft Brexit withdrawal agreement and a political declaration about future relations between the UK and the EU. It hasn't been painless - two cabinet ministers and two junior ministers resigned while some Conservative MPs want to force a leadership contest. What happens now?The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. Mrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, last week. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.The deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states. A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. It is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.Alongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is that 26-page ""political declaration"" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like.  This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.The political declaration envisages ""a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"". There would be ""ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.The two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop. Here's our Reality Check team's view of the key points of the declarationThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.The role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.Mrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.They could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.Dominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft withdrawal agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"". Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department. Others to go were Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara and Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.A number of Conservatives have said publicly that they have written letters to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee, made up of backbench MPs - saying they have no confidence in Mrs May's leadership. These include the head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former minister John Whittingdale. Party rules say that if Sir Graham receives 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of MPs - it will trigger a vote of confidence.If Mrs May wins that a secret ballot, she would be immune from another challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Sir Graham will not reveal the number of letters he receives until he gets to that magic number. More than a week after the rebels went public it seems they have failed to get to the 48 figure.It is not yet clear how any of this will affect Brexit and the outcome of talks.An emergency EU summit is due to be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.If it hasn't been tricky enough already for Mrs May, probably the most difficult part comes if and when the UK government and the EU have agreed on their preferred Brexit deal.She then has to persuade MPs to vote for it. Any vote is expected to take place in the first half of December.Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.If Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.Some Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out. On Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was ""no question"" of reopening talks. Mrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, ""nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow"" and it would mean taking ""a path of deep and grave uncertainty"".

2018-11-22,Academic jailed for spying 'failed' by UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-tyne-46300609,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe wife of a British student jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom.Daniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University's Matthew Hedges sentenced to life.The 31-year-old denies spying but prosecutors said he had confessed.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for ""a very frank conversation"". Theresa May said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation adding that it was ""being raised at the highest level"" in the UAE.Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May. Ms Tejada, who is due to meet Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt later, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been ""stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance"" and only began to take her husband's case seriously once he had been released on bail on 29 October after enduring months of solitary confinement. ""I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and welfare,"" Ms Tejada said.She said she had contacted the Foreign Office ""on a weekly basis"" since her husband's arrest in May. ""They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn't part of their job, it wasn't part of their duty,"" she continued.""On one occasion one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren't obliged to make such representations."" She said: ""I believe they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publically then through their private representations. ""This is something they failed to do throughout.""He was being detained in unacceptable conditions for something that he didn't do.""Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his ""heart goes out"" to Hedges and his family but Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ""raised this case personally with the crown prince on 12 November"".He told Today: ""The Foreign Office has been acting on (Hedges') behalf at the highest possible levels.""Ms Tejada said she had been unable to speak to her husband since he was sentenced but she could ""imagine he is just as distraught as I am"".""He was very, very scared standing in front of the judge,"" she said, because he was aware of the possibility of receiving an arbitrary judgement.""I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous and he tried to do so on a couple of occasions but was asked to face the judge.""She said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and ""asked to double check if he had heard it right"".Ms Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: ""He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him.""Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded.""She later told Reuters: ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life.""UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had ""confessed in detail to his crimes"" and was ""accorded full rights"" with a ""fair and transparent trial"".But his family say a document he signed which later transpired to be a confession was in Arabic, which he cannot speak or read, and came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help.The attorney general said the sentence, which would see Hedges serve a maximum of 25 years in jail before being deported, was not final as Hedges had the right to appeal.By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner:Britain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - they are an ally.There are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF typhoons and tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy.We've got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase.The suggestion we would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard to target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that we couldn't get by asking the UAE directly.There is nothing that I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in anyway would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions.I've known somebody- a fine upstanding officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail.Professor Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be ""some kind of moratorium"" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region.He said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and ""there was nothing clandestine or covert"" about the material he had.He said there was no ""inkling"" of danger and Hedges was ""no stranger"" to the UAE having ""lived there on and off"" since he was nine years old.Prof Jones said: ""He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him.""Conservative MP Johnny Mercer tweeted it would be ""absolutely disgraceful"" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: ""We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad."" He earlier said the case was ""unacceptable"" and ""Consequences must be immediate until he is released. Resilience required."""

It is proposing a series of 50 measures in a bid to reduce the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed. Last year, 100 cyclists died on UK roads and 470 pedestrians were killed, an increase of 5%.A new cycling and walking ""champion"" would be appointed by the government as part of the plans, to make sure the DfT's policies meet the needs of road users across the UK. Local authorities will be encouraged to spend about 15% of their local transport infrastructure funding on walking and cycling.The DfT also wants to create a new police unit to analyse evidence of dangerous driving that has been caught on camera by other road users.  The ""back office unit"", as outlined in the two-year plan, would allow police forces to handle video and photographic evidence that has been captured on devices like dash cams. It comes after a similar operation was tried out by North Wales Police in October 2016, leading to the force dealing with 129 cases by the following August as a result of submitted footage.A review of the Highway Code could also be carried out to consider its guidance about how drivers should behave in relation to vulnerable road users.An alliance of walking and cycling organisations - Cycling UK, The Ramblers, British Cycling, Living Streets and Sustrans - said they were frustrated the overall strategy did not place more emphasis on speed reduction. Cycling UK chief executive Paul Tuohy said: ""Lowering vehicle speeds around people walking, cycling and horse riding doesn't just reduce the danger to them, but also their perception of the danger.""While the DfT's proposals for amendments to the Highway Code will help save lives, ignoring the threat and dangers of speeding is disappointing.""Cycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said: ""Greater road safety - and especially the protection of vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders - is essential.""We want to improve air quality, encourage healthy exercise, reduce obesity and boost our high streets and economic productivity.  ""That means more support for cycling and walking, and that's why these new measures are designed to deliver.""Are you a cyclist who has experienced dangerous driving by motorists?

Good luck. What do we need to do to help?""He added the delegation will comprise of businesses large and small, urban and rural, industrial and agricultural.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) MLA Jim Allister accused them of ""lining up to pay homage"" to the prime minister.He said they had failed to answer why they are supportive of a backstop which involves regulations on imports from Great Britain.""The rush to embrace a crippling Irish Sea border is as absurd as it is destructive of our economy,"" he added. It comes as the DUP leader Arlene Foster said she wants to meet business organisations who have come out in support of the draft EU withdrawal agreement.Arlene Foster said that she wants the meeting to be next week ""if they want to meet me"".The DUP leader declined to state whether she supported Sammy Wilson's ""puppets"" description, but said she met a businessman who employs 300 people and has a turnover of £70m who is ""absolutely outraged"" by the Brexit deal.She said there were many more like him who had ""a clear view on the withdrawal agreement"".The BBC understands the DUP have asked the NI Chamber of Commerce to facilitate a meeting with business organisations on Monday.However, the former First Minister denied her party's confidence and supply agreement with the government was dead, adding it was ""very much still in existence""."
2018-11-22,Half of tuition fees spent on teaching,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46289373,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLess than half of the tuition fee paid by students in England can be spent on the cost of teaching, says research from a university think tank.The Higher Education Policy Institute says the rest is spent on buildings, IT and libraries, administration, or welfare such as mental health support.It comes as a review is scrutinising the cost of student fees and loans.A separate public spending watchdog report warns that the sale of student loans is providing poor value.The Public Accounts Committee says that student loans with a face value of £3.5bn were sold last year to private investors for £1.7bn - with MPs unconvinced this was a good deal for taxpayers.The review of post-18 education funding, commissioned by the prime minister, is examining how to redesign university fees and student loans.There have been suggestions that the review is looking at cutting fees to £6,500 - raising questions about the cost of delivering courses.Both university reports from the Higher Education Policy Institute and the Public Accounts Committee examine whether students and taxpayers are getting value for money.The think tank report says that universities might only spend 45% of tuition fee income on teaching - with the rest spent on other services or administration.Students should be given much more information about how their fee is being used, says the study.A breakdown from Nottingham Trent per student showed:The research also shows that universities can have very different levels of dependency on the current £9,250 annual tuition fees.Tuition fees were only 15% of income for Cambridge, but at Falmouth it was 83% and Nottingham Trent was 81%.This puts financial pressure on universities to recruit - and last week it was revealed that a university had to be bailed out with an emergency loan.""Tuition fees were introduced 20 years ago and they have been tripled twice. Ministers and regulators have repeatedly demanded information on where the fees go. Yet there is still little information available,"" says the institute's director, Nick Hillman.The Office for Students said: ""We can identify and will act when they are not transparent about value for money or are not delivering strong enough outcomes for students or taxpayers.""A report from the Public Accounts Committee warns that the taxpayer should be getting a better deal when the government sells off student loans to private investors.Last year, it says the government only received a return of 48p in the pound - in the deal in which £3.5bn of student debt was sold for £1.7bn.The MPs recognise that the full value will not be obtained, because so many students are unlikely to pay back all that they have borrowed.""In this case, government received too little in return for what it gave up,"" says the committee.The committee, which oversees government spending, says it is ""not convinced"" by explanations for the pricing of these public assets.It also calls for more transparency about the investors profiting from the sale.""The public deserves to know who stands to gain from the sale of public assets,"" says committee chair, Meg Hillier.Labour's Angela Rayner described it as ""ripping off the taxpayer"".But a spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""We are confident that we achieved value for money for taxpayers from the first sale of student loans. ""As the National Audit Office has found, we received more for the loans than the value to government of retaining them, further strengthening the public finances.""But she said the system was designed on the basis that ""many students will never fully pay back their loans"".

2018-11-22,Price cap plan for rent-to-own sector,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46289853,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPlans to cap the costs of buying domestic goods such as TVs and fridges through rent-to-own shops have been welcomed by the stores' customers. Michele Jacques, from Droylsden in Manchester, ended up spending £700 on a cooker as a result of interest rates that can reach 99% a year.Had she gone to a High Street shop, it could have cost her as little as £250.The proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mean rent-to-own customers would pay much less.Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. ""Interest rates should be capped. They shouldn't be allowed to make so much profit from vulnerable people,"" said Ms Jacques.""It does make you frustrated. It makes you angry.""She said the cap proposed by the FCA was ""the correct thing to do"".First, the FCA will limit the amount of interest that customers pay.From April 2019, they will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. So if a cooker costs £300, they will pay no more than £600 in total, including the cost of credit.However, rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that.Second, the cost of the goods themselves will be limited.Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - i.e the middle price - of three mainstream retailers.Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA said: ""Today's measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. ""A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices."" The FCA says the cap could save about 400,000 consumers up to £22.7m a year.In a series of examples, someone who buys a Hotpoint cooker on a rent-to-own basis could save as much as £606 over a three-year period, or £3.88 a week.Someone buying an Indesit fridge freezer through rent-to-own could save £360 a year, or £2.31 a week.The main providers of rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome.A BrightHouse spokesman said: ""BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers. ""We're going to carefully consider today's announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need.""PerfectHome said it too would consider the plans in detail.The proposed cap was welcomed by the debt charity StepChange, The Money Advice Trust, and by  Citizens Advice.""This cap is a victory for people who struggle with the runaway costs of rent-to-own agreements,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice.""A cap gets to the heart of the problem by stopping costs from spiralling out of control and pushing people into further debt.""Our evidence has repeatedly shown that well-designed caps can reduce the harm high-cost credit can cause, as they have done in the payday loan market.""However Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert at Moneycomms, said rent-to-own goods will remain expensive.""The measures are long overdue and will help, but you have to question whether a 100% mark up is acceptable. It's a big shift in the right direction, but in essence customers can end up paying double the retail price which still seems excessive."""
2018-11-22,Wales aims to speed up cancer diagnosis,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-46261915,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWales will become the first UK nation to introduce a new single waiting time target for cancer patients.It is an effort to speed up diagnosis and improve poor survival rates for the 17,000 patients who get it every year. The clock will start on cancer treatment for all patients as soon as it is suspected, not just those with clear symptoms.The two-month target from next June is expected to eventually replace the two-track system.There are concerns that the current cancer targets do not reflect long delays some patients face waiting for diagnosis or treatment.Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said the change - making Wales the first UK nation to move towards a single cancer waiting time - was the ""right thing to do"".He recognised that existing targets had not been met often enough but said 92% of cancer patients were being treated within target times. There are currently urgent and non-urgent routes to getting treatmentIf you are urgent - and the signs of cancer are obvious - you're referred by your GP to hospital and your treatment is supposed to start within 62 daysBut if you symptoms are more unclear, vague or there is a suspicion it could be cancer - you might face months of being sent around different parts of the health service before cancer is diagnosed.Only when that happens does the clock start - and then you're on a non-urgent 31 day route. It might seem faster but you've been already waiting. So, treating all suspected cancers at the same - and all getting a 62-day treatment target from the point it is suspected - will aim to see more of these ""non-urgent"" patients faster too, and enable more to survive. Not only that, but because the non-urgent pathway does not measure how long people have been bouncing around the NHS system before a decision is taken to start treatment, the experts argue it's impossible to find out where the real delays are.Mr Gething said health boards would ""shadow report"" the new target alongside the existing ones.He said: ""Through dual reporting of the single cancer pathway, Wales will be the first UK nation to move towards a single waiting time measure for cancer. ""It is reflective of our aspiration to support early diagnosis of cancer and ensure fast and effective treatment for all patients."" Doctors say there are ""considerable challenges"" with rising demand, while they aim for earlier diagnosis to push Wales up the league tables for cancer survival in Europe.Prof Tom Crosby, medical director of the Wales Cancer Network, said he believed the single cancer pathway was ambitious but the aim was to improve patient chances as well as their experience and also be a ""platform"" for improving access to diagnostic screenings and tests, which would be coming under increasing pressure.""This has the potential to transform our diagnostic cancer services in Wales and I believe Wales would be leading the way in this regard,"" he said. ""Scotland are very interested in what we're doing, England are looking at something a little more modest, focusing just on the diagnostic part of the journey. But we think access to treatment after the patient has had the diagnosis is also a really important thing to do.""Speeding up the process of diagnosing patients - including all the scans they need at a one-stop shop - has been the subject of a pilot in two hospitals over the last year.At Royal Glamorgan, 259 patients with vague symptoms of cancer were referred by their GPs and given the full range of tests at one time. Altogether 10% were found to have cancer.At Neath Port Talbot hospital, 45 patients were found to have cancer out of 385 seen. Around half were not diagnosed but were found to have nothing sinister and 40% were found to have a significant issue but nothing cancerous.Peter Hall, 77, a retired construction worker from Swansea, was given a CT scan. He got results a few hours later and told he was clear of cancer although he had a lung infection.""It answered a lot of questions, everything was spot on,"" he said. ""It would be good if it could be increased for more patients, it's a marvellous idea."""
2018-11-22,Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46288433,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May went head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons. Here's what happened.Theresa May got a taste of what is to come if she manages to return from Brussels with a Brexit deal, as she came under fire from every Brexit faction in the Commons - and faced calls from Jeremy Corbyn to stand aside and let Labour have a go.The Labour leader zeroed in on comments by new Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who said MPs would prevent a no-deal Brexit, apparently putting her at odds with the PM's ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" stance.He asked: ""Does the prime minister agree there are no circumstances under which Britain would leave with no-deal?""Mrs May replied ""no"" and said the alternative to her deal would ""either be more uncertainty, more division or it could risk no Brexit at all"".""Isn't it the case that Parliament will rightly reject this bad deal,"" asked Mr Corbyn, ""and if the government can't negotiate an alternative then it should make way for those who can and will.""Mrs May replied: ""He is opposing a deal he hasn't read, he's promising a deal he can't negotiate, he's telling Leave voters one thing and Remain voters another - whatever (Mr Corbyn) will do, I will act in the national interest.""Mr Corbyn then asked whether the withdrawal agreement was finalised or whether there will be changes to come.Mrs May said it was ""part of a package"" with the political declaration on the future relationship with the European Union.Mr Corbyn made time for a dig at new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, noting that Mrs May was heading to Brussels on Wednesday afternoon, rather than him.He called Mr Barclay another ""non-travelling"" Brexit Secretary and wondered whether the post was now ""entirely ceremonial"". Mr Barclay managed a grin.Then it was on to the transition period, that is due to kick-in after Brexit day in March, that the business secretary said earlier this week could be extended to 2022.Mr Corbyn said it meant being outside of the EU and with no leverage. ""Does she think she is fooling anyone"" that she will get a free trade agreement by the end of 2020, asked the Labour leader.Mrs May said the future relationship document, currently the subject of intense negotiations, will set out ""the structure and scope"" of the deal.""He says there is a problem and he would do it differently,"" she went on, ""he is playing party politics, I am working in the national interest"".The prime minister had said in February that ""a border down the Irish Sea is something no UK prime minister could ever agree to"", said Mr Corbyn, so why would the backstop do just that? It wouldn't, said Mrs May.The pair repeated their attack lines before Mrs May brought their clash to an end with a declaration that ""the public gave us an instruction to leave the European Union"".Mrs May rejected a call from the SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, to renegotiate her Brexit deal to keep the UK in the single market and customs union, saying it would ""frustrate the vote of the British people"".The prime minister branded Green MP Caroline Lucas's call for another referendum, on the grounds that public opinion had shifted since the 2016 referendum, ""absolutely ridiculous,"" saying the public had given this Parliament ""an instruction"" to leave the EU.Tory MP Bob Neill asked about Gibraltar.Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet last week over the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement, asked whether the UK was definitely going to leave the EU on 29 March.Here is BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take on the session:Theresa May must have felt that she picked up today where she left off on Thursday, with another rolling interrogation on Brexit. And she quickly defaulted into her weary-but-resolute mode.Backbench Brexiteer Andrew Rossindell kicked off proceedings with a direct appeal for the PM to change course on Brexit, saying her plan was not the Brexit his Romford constituents voted for. Then Jeremy Corbyn piled in with a well-targeted question picking up comments from ministers that ""no deal"" was not an option, and asking if there were any circumstances where the UK would quit the EU without a deal - a question the prime minister didn't really answer.The confusion deepened a little later, when the PM confirmed to her ex-colleague Esther McVey that the UK would leave on the appointed date of 29 March - which at least implied that this was possible without a deal, and also seemed to pull back from previous warnings that failing to back her proposed Brexit deal risked ""no Brexit at all"".Another important moment came when the DUP Leader Nigel Dodds confirmed that his party's relations with the government remain in the deep freeze, when he asked a hostile question about the disappearance of a government promise that the people of Northern Ireland would have the final say on any divergence from the UK's single market. You could hear the acid drip as he asked: ""Did she press the delete button?""  No sign of kissing and making up there. And that matters because it is hard to see how the PM's deal gets through the Commons without Mr Dodds and his troops (now restored to full strength with the return from suspension of Ian Paisley Jr).It was a noisy session but I was expecting it to be noisier still. Part of the reason may be that the big-name Brexiteers who have been trying to unseat the PM did not intervene, which would surely have produced cheers and jeers aplenty (Jacob Rees-Mogg was in the chamber, but did not attempt to speak and left before the end of the session). Another factor is that neither of the two main players was able to sound a clear trumpet note to their troops.  Jeremy Corbyn was in an excellent position to call for a second referendum, but clearly had no intention of doing so, and his mainly-Remainer MPs were not, therefore, delighted.We already know that Theresa May's deal has not exactly delighted Conservative MPs either (even the ones who support it) and a series of questions on the details (Bob Neill on Gibraltar, George Freeman on Northern Ireland, Neil Parish on agriculture) caught the wary mood on the Tory benches. It seemed to me that the two leaders were both better at attacking each other than defending their own positions, which meant that a lot of time was taken up with accusations of ""more muddled than thou"". But the bottom line is that it is now close to impossible - in the absence of any overriding mega-event - to talk about anything but Brexit at PMQs. "

British Gas, the biggest energy supplier in the UK, has 3.1 million customers on its SVT, down from 4.3 million at the start of the year.It plans to reduce this to below 3 million by the end of the year.Centrica gave the details in a trading update in which its chief executive, Iain Conn, said the company was on track to achieve its financial targets for the years in the face of ""strong competition"" and ""regulation in energy supply"".""Maintaining a focus on performance delivery and financial discipline and demonstrating resilient cash flows remain our objectives for 2019 and beyond, as we deal with the impact of the UK energy supply default tariff cap,"" said Mr Conn.The price cap, introduced by regulator Ofgem, is intended to save 11 million customers an average of £76 a year on their gas and electricity bills. More than half of all households in Britain are on default tariffs because they have never switched or have not done so recently.The cap is due to be reviewed in February, and then be adjusted in April and October each year.Ofgem has already said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower than £76."
2018-11-22,"Homeless population 'rises to 320,000'",https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/education-46289259,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThis year, 320,000 people were recorded as homeless in Britain, analysis from housing charity Shelter suggests.It is a rise of 13,000, or 4%, on last year's figures and equivalent to 36 new people becoming homeless every day.London has the highest rate of homelessness, but it is growing fastest in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and north-west England, the analysis says.The government says it is investing £1.2bn to tackle homelessness.The report, which is published as temperatures start to plummet, says the real level of homelessness is notoriously difficult to measure.Only individuals in contact with local authorities or in hostels are included in the official figures.Telli Afrik, his wife and two young children, are one family caught up in the homelessness crisis.They lost their home this year because, despite working, they could on longer afford to pay their rent.They are living in a single room in their sixth homelessness hostel and have to eat sitting on the floor because they have no table.Telli also lost his job as a supermarket manager because he had to attend so many appointments with different housing teams.""That was a direct result of our homelessness,"" he says.""Financially we've been brought to nothing. ""My confidence - nothing. My family is at breaking point.""Shelter analysts arrived at the total of 320,000 after collating official figures for those living in temporary accommodation, sleeping rough and the number of hostel places taken up, reducing them to compensate for potential double-counting. Statistics for Scotland include only those in temporary accommodation, while those for Wales cover temporary accommodation and known rough sleepers.The charity says its figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, as they do not include people unknown to the authorities or experiencing other types of homelessness not included in the figures.They add that rough sleeping figures are particularly difficult to record because many people hide and remain out of sight for safety reasons and are not seen by the council officials who carry out the counts.So, those who bed down for the night in derelict buildings rather than the more obvious shop doorways are often missed out of the tally.But the figures show that since Shelter first carried out this kind of analysis in 2016, an extra 25,000 people have become homeless.They also mean one in every 200 Britons is either sleeping rough or living in temporary accommodation, such as hostels and B&Bs.Chief executive of the charity Polly Neate said: ""These new figures show that homelessness is having a devastating impact on the lives of people right across the country.  ""Due to the perfect storm of spiralling rents, welfare cuts and a total lack of social housing, record numbers of people are sleeping out on the streets or stuck in the cramped confines of a hostel room. ""We desperately need action now to change tomorrow for the hundreds of thousands whose lives will be blighted by homelessness this winter.""Previous research by the charity highlighted how many people were prevented from finding somewhere new, when made homeless, because the low level of housing benefit they were entitled to would not cover their rent.Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said a new law required local councils to do more to prevent homelessness.He added that the government was supporting those working on the front line to help get people off the street and into accommodation.And he highlighted the government's affordable housing programme."

""We lose Britain, and we keep Italy: it's grotesque"", one former minister commented ruefully to me.That barbed remark lays bare a real anxiety among Germans, that somehow the European Union's centre of gravity will shift once the UK has gone, that a delicate balance will be upset, and it will not be in Berlin's favour.Identifying Italy hints at one source of concern, that the southern Europeans will want to carry in their free spending way. What was for a long time the subtext of European debates, that Germany can be expected to subsidise the others because of war guilt as well as the strength of its economy, became increasingly overt during the Greek debt crisis. Now Italy, with far larger debts, is on a budgetary collision course with the EU.There is though another aspect to the comments one hears these days about how the post-Brexit EU might function, and it hints at a deeper and more emotive schism. If a generation of German politicians has hailed the European project as a triumph for peace this was at least in part because it has provided a way of converting long rivalry with France from the cause of 20th Century wars to the 'engine' of the Continent's economic success. Now though one hears disparagement of France and its president Emanuel Macron from different political quarters. A senior German journalist, commenting on the prominence given to Angela Merkel's meetings with President Macron to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice, said to me, anger in her voice, ""you see? This is our future, this will have to be our future partner, because you are leaving"".Meeting Alexander Gauland, leader of the right wing Alternative for Germany party in his spectacular office overlooking the Reichstag, he too cannot hold back on the subject on France.  ""The British are the only believers in free trade,"" he told us in a Newsnight interview, ""the French are bureaucratic in a way we don't like in our party"".Of course there are still pro-French voices in German politics, including those who feel that Chancellor Merkel has missed a real opportunity to build the Eurozone by spurning Mr Macron's proposals for further financial integration. But in my recent contacts at least, I have noticed rather more members of the German establishment who reject what the president stands for, suspecting another attempt to get Germany to finance French public spending and worrying about the destabilizing effect of Brexit.""For decades there has been a delicate triangle of power running Europe,"" the former minister quoted earlier says, ""and with Berlin, Paris, and London each playing their own distinctive role"". His concern is that removing the UK, with its big contributions to European security and financial prudence will lead to bigger problems for the EU. Germany, even during the long Merkel years, has been diffident about playing the leadership role in Europe. It is comfortable with tactical interventions on monetary or political matters, much less so in flexing diplomatic or military muscle. The prospect of Brexit has brought the realization that France may now try to fill this vacuum. While many German politicians are uneasy about the idea of leading Europe, it seems that the idea of letting President Macron (who one person I was talking to this week in Berlin called, ""a charlatan"") play that role by default disturbs them. Indeed it may rankle so much that it causes Germany to abandon its post Second World War reluctance to exert its power in Europe.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates.Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father, is a former Conservative MEP and founder of Environmentalists for Europe, who believes the UK would be better off remaining in the EU.Ella Whelan, author and journalist at Spiked, staunchly believes in Brexit.They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting.But did they get on?How would you describe yourself? Barely blonde public-school boy. What are your views on Brexit? In the run-up to Brexit, I was very much for Remain. However, when Britain voted, I said, ""OK, we're going to leave."" But I am absolutely not in favour of Brexit along the terms the government is discussing. What was your initial impression? A real pleasure to meet her and obviously a first-class brain there. I found it hard to keep up, actually.How was your date? Lively stuff - it did me a lot of good to be exposed to someone who was deeply committed to the Brexit deal.What was the best thing about the date? The sausages were very good. What was the worst thing? Possibly being forced to concentrate for about two hours.What did you talk about? I argued that during my time in the EU, it was in a way quite exciting to be able to use the EU mechanisms to drive through projects and programmes and political decisions which it might have been harder to get through if you just worked at a national level, country by country.What was her most convincing argument? She did convince me that there are a lot of people out there who take Brexit very seriously indeed - it's not just a political football to be kicked around. Even if it did come to a second vote... I don't think that the Remainers would necessarily find it any easier to win the argument than they did last time round. Did you convince her on anything? Well I very much doubt that. That would be a first. I don't think I've ever convinced anyone about anything.Would you see her again? Absolutely, with great pleasure.Describe her in three words: Intelligent, articulate, attractive. Marks out of 10 for the date: Sounds a bit like Strictly Come Dancing - I'd give it an eight or a nine because I was intrigued and absorbed and actually fairly challenged by our discussion.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.What was your initial impression? A very, very, charming man - I was a little intimidated as he has been an MEP and is very knowledgeable in relation to the EU but we got on very well. How was your date? It went well, we agreed more than I thought we would, which was a nice surprise because it meant that we could actually talk about some of the finer points rather than going at each other's throats.What was the best thing about the date? Being taken out by a gentleman was a very nice thing to do. What was the worst thing? That we didn't get to finish the dinners because we were talking about Brexit too much. What did you talk about? We talked about the Irish border a lot, which I think is one of the most interesting things for me about looking at what's gone wrong with the Brexit discussion.Any common ground? We both agreed that what has happened to Brexit is a terrible sham.What was your biggest disagreement? We really disagreed on immigration and not how you'd think because I'm very pro-immigration and Stanley is quite anti it because he is very concerned about population growth. In another discussion, about immigration, we may not have got along as well as we did.Did he convince you on anything? No, but that's not because he wasn't thoughtful but because I think that this debate is the centre of my political outlook, so it would take more than an earthquake to change my mind on this. Would you see him again? We come from totally different backgrounds but sometimes once in a while that works. And he's a gentleman, so yes, why not?Describe him in three words: Charming, ardent and patient.

This is in part a reflection of Iran's lingering resentment of Britain's role in helping to depose an elected prime minister here in the 1950s. It also reflects the UK's close relationship with the United States, a country with which Iran seems to be in a permanent state of confrontation. So when Jeremy Hunt arrived in Tehran this week for his first visit as foreign secretary, he was not ignored. He had a long meeting and lunch with his counterpart, the veteran foreign minister Javad Zarif. He was also granted a rare meeting with the Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, a powerful figure in Iran's military. Iranian media packed in to film him, and his visit made the local papers. (I am sorry to report that this does not happen everywhere a British foreign secretary goes these days.)This attention on Mr Hunt, though, was not just because of Iran's historic perspective of the UK. It was also because right now Iran needs the UK's help.Since the United States withdrew from the deal to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and re-imposed sanctions, Iran has been desperate to protect its trade with Europe.Britain and the EU have promised to help but are struggling to find ways of encouraging European firms to continue doing business with Iran. Many firms are pulling out for fear of US fines and loss of trade. There is a plan for the EU to set up a special financial system that would allow Iran to barter its oil exports in a way that could avoid US sanctions. But nothing is happening quickly, and many doubt it will work. Foreign Minister Zarif told me: ""We need to see some action. We welcome the political commitment from the UK and (other European countries) but we believe that political commitment needs to be followed by action.""The Iranians can be phlegmatic about the impact of US sanctions. Officials here frequently refer back to the way Iran coped with its eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s, when more than half a million Iranians died. Analysts speak of Iran's ""resilience economy"". But even Mr Zarif admits to me that these new sanctions will hurt: ""Ordinary people will suffer, our economy is going to suffer.""So this was the context of Mr Hunt's visit and it was a fair diplomatic wind he appeared determined to use to deliver some key messages. Much of his focus, inevitably, was the fate of British-Iranian nationals such as Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who have been detained by the regime. The foreign secretary was outspoken in threatening consequences for Iran if they were not released. But Mr Zarif said he was not in a position to discuss the legality of such cases, because they were the result of decisions made by Iran's judiciary.Mr Hunt tried to see a senior judge yesterday, but after much coming and going, the meeting failed to materialise. I asked Mr Zarif why Iran could not release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe -  not only to correct a gross injustice, but also to improve relations between the UK and Iran. The answer that he could not give me is that there are some Iranian hardliners who want nothing of the sort and are using the detained British dual nationals deliberately to sour diplomatic relations. And until that changes, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's fate remains bleak. The real diplomatic focus of Mr Hunt's trip was his push for an end to the fighting in Yemen. Iran plays a key role here as the international backer of the Houthi rebels, providing them with money and missiles, according to the US, something Iran denies.The foreign secretary urged Iran to encourage the Houthis to come to the UN-backed talks in Stockholm later this month to see if a cessation of hostilities can be agreed and a political process begun. Mr Hunt is cautious, telling me that ""both sides don't trust each other further than they can throw each other."" But he was also optimistic that confidence-building measures could gradually bring the Saudis and the Houthis to the table. Britain is in charge of the negotiations at the UN in New York, and is circulating a new resolution to this end. The problem here in Tehran is that the Iranians do not think the Saudi-led coalition, which is fighting the Houtis, is going far enough. The Saudis have agreed to stop targeting civilian areas in Yemen. But Foreign Minister Zarif told me that this had too many loopholes, and Saudi Arabia should stop all its military operations. Otherwise it could carry on launching air strikes and just claim it was not targeting civilian areas. The fact that Mr Hunt pressed ahead with this trip despite the political turmoil in Britain - and at the risk of angering US allies - reflects the importance he places in improving Britain's relations with Iran and landing some key messages, particularly on Yemen. He told me that Iran is one of the great historic civilisations in the world that, like Russia, is desperate for international respect but is going about it in the wrong way. He said it had to end what he regarded as disruptive behaviour in the region. The problem is that analysis is not shared by everyone in Tehran and Washington. The hardliners here project their country's power through military force and proxy political support in places like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. And hardliners in the Trump administration see Iran as the world's greatest sponsor of terrorism, a country bent on securing nuclear weapons. And for now, some modest diplomacy from a middling-sized European power is not going to change that hard reality."
2018-11-22,Choppy waters,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46264303,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe EU 27 are concerned that ""taking back control"" of the UK's waters might mean fewer fishing opportunities for their fleets. A diplomatic note - seen by the BBC - raised concerns about access and environmental commitments.The prospect might be a surprise to them, focused on 585 pages of draft agreements, but it's been the backbone of the economic argument for the UK's most pro-Brexit industry. Many have said it would be the litmus-test of the whole process.  The waters around all the EU's member states, up to a limit of 200 miles, are effectively ""pooled"" when it comes to fishing.  It means boats from one country can fish in another's seas. When the UK leaves the EU, barring any new agreements, those waters will exclusively become the UK's again, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.There's also a further separate international agreement, called the London Fisheries Convention, covering the 12 miles closest to the shore. It's being terminated, meaning no foreign vessel will be allowed to fish in UK waters without the UK's permission. A long-running fear among skippers has been that their fishing rights would be ""traded away"" in deals done for the benefit of more economically valuable sectors. The draft withdrawal agreement seems to rule that out but it doesn't mean foreign boats will be immediately chased away by British vessels.  None of the industry bodies has advocated allowing only UK boats to fish in our exclusive economic zone - the sea up to 200 miles from UK shores. What they want is for the UK - or the nations of the UK - to decide who is and isn't allowed in.When Greenland left the EU, in 1982, it allowed limited access to its waters in exchange for infrastructure funding. Greenland initially held all the quotas for its exclusive seas but effectively sold off some.A similar negotiation is proposed between the UK and EU but there is no commitment to reaching a deal. The document simply says the two parties will ""use their best endeavours"" to do so.There will have to be flexibility as British boats don't just fish in British waters. The recent scallop skirmishes in the Baie de Seine, which resulted in tussles at sea between French and British fishermen in a row over access to fishing grounds, illustrated the need for cross-border cooperation.  The fishing industry in towns such as Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Grimsby will see Brexit as a success only if their harbours are filled with more local boats in the years ahead.  Important too is the link being made between fishing opportunities for EU vessels and the sale of fish and seafood by the UK into the EU.  It's unlikely the prominence of fishing will crumble in the wider noise of securing a trade deal, mainly because most of the industry is in Scotland.The block of 13 Scottish Conservative MPs, including the Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, have repeatedly taken a tough collective stance with the prime minister over the issue, only last week restating that it would be a ""betrayal"" if the EU retained any control over fishing rights.Those 13 Tories have a stronger voting power than the 10 DUP members keeping Theresa May in office.And looming over all this is the threat of a second referendum on Scottish independence. It would be of great political benefit to the SNP if it was able to claim the fleet had been ""let down by Westminster"" on fishing.Of course, a general election could change the dynamic entirely but short of that its difficult to see any radical shift.As for the environmental concerns, annually the quotas for fishing catches are based on scientific advice. That is, scientists prescribe how much of each stock - cod, haddock et cetera - can be caught sustainably. It then becomes a political negotiation over how to divide up the stock between countries.It's difficult to argue with the scientists - although many often do.But if the UK decides to conduct its own scientific research - and that contradicts the European Commission's - the negotiations could become sticky.Until not so long ago, Iceland had a long running dispute with the EU over its rights to fish for mackerel when its own scientists detected changes in their migration patterns.But because it was an independent coastal state, it held many of the cards and eventually secured a much larger share of the catch.  It had muscle and used it.So, should the EU 27 feel concerned about future fishing opportunities being restricted?  We don't know the answer yet. A lot is at stake - from fishing rights to market access  - and so, the negotiations will be complex."

2018-11-22,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-22,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181122183550/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

2018-11-23,EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46312909,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. She told a BBC phone-in that there would be just ""more division and uncertainty"" if Parliament voted against the agreement next month. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". A summit of EU leaders to sign off the deal will go ahead on Sunday despite ""unresolved"" issues over Gibraltar.Spain is seeking written assurances from the UK that it will be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory.Its prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said he won't decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until these are provided.He has said his backing for the overall deal cannot be taken for granted although no one country can block the withdrawal agreement on its own at this stage. Meanwhile, the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, has said she will ""look again"" at her party's deal with the Conservatives if Mrs May's Brexit bill passes through parliament.""But we are not there yet,"" Mrs Foster added.Mrs May told the Emma Barnett Show that her job was to persuade MPs to back her but also to ""explain"" the merits of the deal to the public.Asked what her plan B was, if MPs rejected the deal, she suggested there would be little point going back to the EU to ask for further changes.""I believe if we were to go back to the European Union and say: Well people didn't like that deal, can we have another one? ... I don't think they're going to come to us and say: We'll give you a better deal.""Mrs May, who has previously warned about the dangers of the UK leaving without a deal or not leaving at all, would not be drawn on whether she would quit if MPs refused to back her deal.Asked what was a more likely outcome in such an event - a no-deal exit or the UK remaining in the EU - she said ""from my point of view, personally, there is no question of 'no Brexit' because the government needs to deliver on what people voted on in the referendum in 2016"".Asked by a caller called Michael if the UK would be better off outside the EU under her deal than staying in, she said that as someone who voted to Remain, she had never said the ""sky would fall in"" if Brexit happens.""I think we will be better off in a situation which we'll have outside the European Union, where we have control of all those things, and are able to trade around the rest of the world,"" she said.She added: ""You say: Are we better off?... actually it's a different sort of environment, and a different approach that we'll be taking to things.""Pressed by Emma Barnett to answer the question, she said ""it is going to be different,"" before adding: ""We can build a better future outside the European Union.""The UK and EU have agreed in principle the framework for their future relations outlining how UK-EU trade, security and other issues would work.The document, known as the ""political declaration"", is not legally-binding but will be the starting point for negotiations on co-operation after the UK leaves. It has been heavily criticised by many MPs for lacking detail. This is a separate document to the legally-binding withdrawal agreement - setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, including the £39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said what was on offer in the political declaration was inferior to EU membership, as it would leave the UK bound by the same rules but without control over them.Meanwhile, EU officials are meeting to try to put the finishing touches to both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration.The future of Gibraltar and its 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, remains a sticking point.Spain has long contested Britain's 300 year-rule of the peninsula and there are concerns about how the territory's political status and economic ties with the Spanish mainland will be affected by Brexit. Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law and employment law at Trinity College, Cambridge, told the BBC that Spain's room for manoeuvre was limited as the ""divorce"" document only had to be agreed at EU level by qualified majority voting, meaning 20 of the 27 member states.Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, said the territory was perfectly happy to have ""direct engagement"" with Madrid over future trade relations but would not be ""dragged"" into doing so"
2018-11-23,"Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott",https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46315250,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowAnother EU referendum is not ""off the table"" for Labour but would probably be won by Leave again, says Diane Abbott. The shadow home secretary said she was ""as sure as anyone can be"" that ""the referendum vote will be honoured and we will come out of the EU next spring"".But she repeated her warning that those urging a new referendum should should ""be careful what they wish for"".""My view is that ...Leave would win again,"" she told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast.""And not only would Leave win again but Leave voters would say: 'What didn't you understand about Leave the first time?'"" At the Labour Party conference in September, party members approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote - but said last week that a new referendum was ""an option for the future"" but ""not an option for today"".The People's Vote campaign group, which organised a march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people, wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal.But Labour says it would prefer to see a general election, if Theresa May loses the ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal.Asked how that could come about, as the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour of an election, or go through a no-confidence procedure, Ms Abbott said: ""This is an era of things that you never thought could happen, are happening and whatever the legislation says, in the end, Parliament disposes and Parliament proposes.""She said she had been an MP through parliamentary ""turmoil"" under Margaret Thatcher and John Major but added: ""I have never seen anything like this and there is a tiny bit of me which thinks this might all end in a general election. It's not clear how that would happen but you can't escape thinking about that.""Earlier this week, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour could form a minority government, without a general election.Ms Abbott was asked whether Labour would ally itself with the DUP - the Northern Ireland Unionist party which has been supporting Theresa May's government in key Commons votes.She said: ""We would only want to ally with a group of MPs who agreed with us on the issues at stake. At this point, we don't agree with the DUP on the issues at stake, but in this sort of parliamentary turmoil you can't necessarily rule anything out.""I always say to my MP colleagues that the people of Hackney send me to Parliament to get rid of the Tories and if it's all about getting rid of this Tory government you do what it takes."""

She was speaking on Radio Ulster's Inside Politics programme.The DUP is holding its annual conference this weekend.""If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then of course that brings us to the situation of looking again at the confidence and supply deal. ""But we are not there yet,"" she said.The DUP leader insisted the government should ""ditch the Irish backstop"" and recognise that, in practice, nobody will implement a hard border on the island of Ireland. She argued that the prospect of such a hard border has taken on a ""mythical status"" in the Brexit negotiations.Mrs Foster argued that the EU Withdrawal Agreement as it stands will not get the support of parliament. Instead of ""wasting time"" on the agreement, she said Mrs May should try to secure a better deal. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is one of two Conservative MPs to attend the DUP party conference in Belfast this weekend.Mr Hammond spoke at a dinner on Friday night.Earlier, he told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the ""parliamentary process"", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop.""I would much prefer to see us extending the implementation period and I am sure my DUP colleagues would take the same view,"" he said.""So we need to look at how we can provide reassurance about how we will use the options that the agreement gives us.""Boris Johnson will give a speech to the conference on Saturday afternoon.Mrs Foster said the reference to the potential use of technology to monitor cross-border trade in the latest EU-UK Political Declaration does not change her party's objections to Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement. She said it would have been much better if both the EU and the UK had explored potential technological solutions to maintaining smooth cross-border trade in the summer of last year, when unionists previously championed the idea. Mrs  Foster said the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding and have the status of an international treaty, so it remains important to the DUP that nothing contained in it damages the UK constitutionally or economically.Inside Politics is on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday at 18:05 GMT and Saturday at 13:35 GMT."
2018-11-23,MPs begin debate on 'gender recognition' laws,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320431,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA debate on trans and women's rights is raging in the LGBT and feminist communities.  The focal point? Possible reforms to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act in England and Wales. Now, for the first time, MPs have formally debated the issue in Parliament. And it's in Parliament where a decision will eventually be made on what to do next.The government has been consulting on whether the current system, whereby someone can legally change their gender, is too clinical, bureaucratic and intrusive. The answer from some is an emphatic yes. The leading LGBT campaign group Stonewall is among those calling for a simpler, more streamlined process.The Scottish government has also said it is committed to reform and has just published some analysis following its own consultation. To change a birth certificate a person currently has to:But there are those with deep concerns - including numerous feminist and women's groups who say they feel vilified and marginalised in this debate. And in a Westminster Hall debate this week, the Conservative MP David TC Davies suggested that the potential reforms might mean ""a 15-stone bearded man could simply define themselves as female and there would be nothing anybody could do to object to this"". He said that, being a ""libertarian"", this wasn't necessarily a problem in itself. But the issue, for some, arises out of a fear that by making it easier to redefine a person's gender, it will be easier to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and even women's refuges.  And that there might be people who will do so for nefarious purposes.But Mr Davies struck a lonely figure around the debating table as MPs from Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats opposed him. Among them, Layla Moran (Liberal Democrat) said that a ""moral panic"" had been ""whipped up to demonise a community"". She said there was nothing to suggest that a person would soon be able to switch genders ""on a whim"" one afternoon.We will have to wait to see what the government's proposals are before it is clear how far the reforms might go. It is worth noting that the 2010 Equality Act protects trans people from discrimination, meaning that someone who identifies as a woman can already access female-only spaces.However, the same legislation also allows services, such as domestic abuse shelters, to exercise a level of discretion on who can access those services.But the case of Karen White, a transgender prisoner who sexually assaulted fellow inmates, is being frequently cited as an example of how the law is already letting women down. This week, Women's Minister Victoria Atkins blamed ""a series of terrible failings that should never have happened"". She said that the Ministry of Justice is reviewing the case as well as the wider protocols in place.The government is expected to announce its next steps on the Gender Recognition Act in spring 2019, once officials have gone through over 100,000 consultation responses. Victoria Atkins emphasised that no decisions have yet been made. But it's clear that the government is inclined towards reform, mindful of its pledge to help improve the lives of LGBT people and tackle transphobia. Any changes will need to go through Parliament, which means this week's Westminster Hall discussion could end up being considerably amplified once it hits the Commons floor where there are currently no trans MPs.Law can underpin culture and culture will influence law. Here a question about birth certificates has been absorbed into a much broader, and contentious, discussion about what it means to be a woman.It poses a difficult question: by enhancing the rights of one community, do you diminish the rights of another? There will be those who say that is totally false premise; that trans rights and women's rights are not in conflict. But the fact that conflict exists on this issue is undeniable and it looks like Parliament will soon have to fully enter the fray."

One had said, even if Mr Segalov was not involved, he ""did not intervene or walk away"" while the other said the fact he was there suggested he was ""willing to engage in or with those who took direct action"".But Lord Justice Simon said: ""The issue of how a journalist should react when faced, at close quarters, with criminal activity is not straightforward.""It is sufficient to say that, in this case, we do not consider the fact that the claimant 'did not intervene or walk away' was a matter that could properly be taken into account to his discredit.""Mr Segalov said the ruling was ""reassuring"" adding: ""The unfair and secret process by which police have until now decided who can and cannot attend party conferences won't be allowed to continue anymore.""If unchallenged, the police's attempts to criminalise journalistic activity by the police suggested journalists should be held responsible for what they report on.""Thankfully the court confirmed what I had attempted to explain to the police all along.""The court dismissed a challenge by Mr Segalov against Greater Manchester Police, who manage the national accreditation scheme for large events, saying it had simply passed on the decision of Sussex Police to the Labour Party."
2018-11-23,UKIP leader defends hiring Tommy Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46308160,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUKIP leader Gerard Batten has defended his decision to hire Tommy Robinson as an adviser and says he had saved the party ""from oblivion"".His predecessor Nigel Farage criticised UKIP's association with the ex-English Defence League leader and said there should be a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten.Mr Batten said many people respected Mr Robinson's ""stand on things"".And he claimed Mr Farage had shown ""0% interest"" in UKIP since ""walking away"". Mr Batten, who is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Mr Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum, said he believed he would see off any challenge to his leadership. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, will advise him on rape gangs and prison reform.In May, the 35-year old former EDL leader was jailed for 13 months for contempt of court, which sparked a series of #freeTommy protests.His conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns and the case has now been referred to the attorney general. Mr Robinson had previously been sentenced to 18 months in jail in January 2014 for mortgage fraud and for 10 months in January 2013 for a passport offence.Asked whether it was appropriate to take advice from someone with a criminal record, Mr Batten said those with ""minor convictions"" deserved a second chance. He told BBC News that Tommy Robinson was a ""high profile"" figure who had been ""persecuted by the state because of his views"".""I think he's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage.""He rejected concerns expressed by Mr Farage and other MEPs, several of whom have quit the party in recent months, that UKIP was becoming tainted with Islamophobia. ""Islamophobic is a made up word… I don't have an irrational fear of Islam, nor does Tommy Robinson.""Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today earlier that, under his leadership, the party had talked about mass immigration and extreme forms of Islam but ""as a non-racist, non-sectarian party"".""This blows a hole in all of that.""While he had not ""given up"" on UKIP, he said he would be writing to the party's ruling National Executive Committee urging a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten as leader and ""that we get rid of him"". ""We can have one last go at getting rid of somebody who as leader is dragging us in a shameful direction.""But Mr Batten said he believed he had the support of UKIP's NEC after rescuing the party from potential financial collapse. He suggested Mr Farage was now more interested in his role with Leave Means Leave, the pro-Brexit campaign group, than UKIP.""It's down to me that this party has survived, not Nigel Farage nor anybody else,"" he said. ""Nigel walked away from UKIP two years ago and hasn't shown any interest in it since.""UKIP was still in the vanguard of the Brexit fight, he argued, and Mr Robinson's presence would increase numbers at a demonstration the party was planning next month. On Sunday, UKIP's NEC deferred a decision on allowing members to vote on Mr Robinson joining the party.The decision was postponed until after 29 March 2019 - the day the UK is due to leave the EU - with the NEC arguing the party should be focused on Brexit.Currently, UKIP has a blanket ban on allowing former members of the British National Party and the EDL from joining the party - meaning Mr Robinson is barred.Last week, some UKIP members of the Welsh Assembly said Mr Robinson should not be allowed to join."

2018-11-23,EU embalming ban 'to change funerals',https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46294432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGrieving loved ones may no longer be able to pay their last respects to dead relatives when the EU bans the chemical in embalming fluid.That is the fear of Britain's funeral directors after MEPs voted to restrict the use of formaldehyde.The EU says it will protect workers' health and save lives.And - in a concession secured by a Conservative MEP - it has delayed the ban on the substance for three years to allow the industry to adjust.If the UK remains in the EU single market for 21 months after it officially leaves on 29 March, as is currently planned, then the government would be expected to transpose the directive into UK law within a strict time limit.The Health and Safety Executive said it would welcome any measures to help controls but is trying to get more time for the funeral industry to adjust.A HSE spokesman said: ""This is not a ban on formaldehyde. The European Commission has proposed formalising exposure limits.""Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen that requires close regulation, which the funeral sector has always taken into account. As is the current case, it will still be used in a controlled manner. ""As a responsible regulator we have always worked closely with the funeral industry to understand its particular needs. This has informed our discussions at EU level. ""Our dialogue with the sector on the proposed limits will continue whatever the terms of our departure from the European Union."" The HSE said the three-year exemption period would come on top of the usual two-year implementation period for a new regulation to come into force, meaning it will not apply to the funeral sector for five years.Funeral directors in the UK are concerned they will not be able to find a replacement for formaldehyde and that they will be faced with extra costs.Formaldehyde, which can cause irritation and has been linked to nasopharyngeal cancer, is one of five industrial chemicals to be added to the European Commission's list of restricted carcinogens and mutagens. The UK funeral industry says it recognises that formaldehyde, which is also used in hospitals and in a wide variety of industrial processes, has been linked to serious illnesses.But it argues that the chemical does not pose a significant risk to workers in the diluted form, known as formalin, used by embalmers.And if an alternative to formalin cannot be found, then the ""culture"" around Christian burials and cremations in the UK, will have to change, with funeral directors advising more families against seeing their loved one in the coffin, although ultimately it is the family's choice whether to do so. The embalming of bodies is prohibited in the Jewish and Muslim faiths. It is not forbidden in Hinduism but is rare because cremation normally takes place within 24 hours of death.The funeral industry estimates between 50% and 55% of cadavers in the UK undergo some form of embalming so they can be viewed by relatives. The practice has become more prevalent in recent years because of the growing length of time between death and funeral, caused by delays in obtaining paperwork.""Visiting a loved one in the chapel of rest can be both a distressing and comforting experience for families, and it is also proven to be an important part of the grieving process,"" says Jon Levett, chief executive of the National Association of Funeral Directors. ""For funeral directors, embalming offers the only realistic solution that will delay deterioration and present the deceased person at peace and as close to their appearance before death as possible; particularly where there has been a post mortem, examination, traumatic death - or to accommodate the increasing gap between death and a funeral which is now often two or three weeks. ""For all of these reasons, embalming remains a common funeral choice in the UK by families, much more so than in Europe.""He welcomed the three-year delay in the implementation of the EU directive to ""allow funeral firms to continue the search for a feasible alternative"" but suggested the UK may need to ""change the culture around funerals to make the need for embalming redundant"". All the alternatives to formalin tried so far ""simply do not work as a preservative"", he added. West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre, who this week secured the three-year exemption in a vote in the European Parliament, said: ""This new legislation is well meant, but I don't think officials in Brussels realised quite how big the impact would be on Britain.""Refrigeration has been used as an alternative to embalming but that can lead to dehydrated remains and, with repeated thawing and refreezing, accelerated decay, leading to ""an unwholesome viewing situation"", a briefing note by the funeral industry said.""For the close viewing of the deceased to take place, it is essential for the deceased to be embalmed so the person viewing is safe (free from the hazard of infection), and that the deceased's remains are fixed and stable and do not chemically break down or decompose and/or release embarrassing odours from decomposition,"" it added.The European Commission says setting maximum values for the concentration in workplace air of the five chemicals added to its list will improve conditions for more than 1,000,000 EU workers and prevent more than 22,000 work-related illnesses over the next 50 years. The Council of Ministers in Brussels is due to vote in the issue on 6 December - and the Health and Safety Executive is hoping it will be agreed."
2018-11-23,UK 'will not trade away fishing' to EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46303911,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has insisted its Brexit agreement will protect the fishing industry despite claims it is preparing to ""sell out"" fishermen.The government's draft agreement on post-Brexit relations says the UK will be an ""independent coastal nation"".The Scottish Fishermen's Federation gave the document a cautious welcome when it was published on Thursday. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon predicted the industry would be used as a ""bargaining chip"" in the future. And Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson, a prominent Brexiteer who has been an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to Brexit, said the agreement was ""unacceptable"" as it meant ""sovereignty over our waters"" would be ""sacrificed for a trade deal"". The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating access and quota rights as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.All 13 Scottish Conservative MPs - including Scottish Secretary David Mundell - warned Mrs May last week that anything less than this would be a ""betrayal of Scotland"". They said they could not support any deal with the EU that would ""prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares"" as this would mean ""we would not be leaving the CFP in practice"". The final draft of the political declaration - a text outlining the future relationship between the EU and the UK after Brexit - contains neutral language about fishing.It says both sides will ""use their best endeavours"" to conclude talks in time for the UK to leave, and adds that they should cooperate on access to waters and quota shares ""within the context of the overall economic partnership"".Mr Thomson and Ms Sturgeon both argue that the latter point shows ministers could use fishing as a ""bargaining chip"" in negotiations with Europe post-Brexit, and both have called on Mr Mundell to consider his position.The first minister told MSPs that the declaration ""represents another Tory sell out of Scottish fishermen"".She said: ""What we see is that the Scottish fishing industry will be used as a bargaining chip in wider trade talks.""In terms of David Mundell's position I would simply say this - his position is a matter for him, but if David Mundell is still in office by the end of today in light of this political declaration he will have forfeited forever any last remaining scrap of principle or credibility that he had.""🐟The political declaration commits UK to ""establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares"". This means sovereignty over our waters sacrificed for a trade deal. That is unacceptable. We must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway. pic.twitter.com/wRCzdSNahfEnd of Twitter post  by @RossThomson_MPThe Scottish Secretary hit back, saying he was ""not taking lessons on standing up for fishermen from Nicola Sturgeon"".He said: ""The prime minister has fiercely resisted the efforts of EU states to make an explicit link between access to our waters and access to markets.""We will negotiate and decide, as an independent coastal state, on access and quota on an annual basis, just like Norway and Iceland do now.""The surest way to guarantee the EU access to Scottish waters would be to rejoin the CFP - exactly what Nicola Sturgeon is demanding.""Mrs May told MPs later in the day that ""the fisheries agreement is not something we will be trading off against any other priorities"".The government has won some backing from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, with chief executive Bertie Armstrong saying the declaration ""gives the UK the power to assert its position as an independent coastal state with practical sovereignty over our waters and natural resources"".However he added that ""we know that several EU nations will not give up their attempts to link access with trade in order to retain absolute rights to fish around our coastline"".He added: ""We will continue to seek assurances from the UK government that it will remain steadfast. We will not rest until the future arrangements are signed, sealed and delivered and we secure this critical control over access to our waters and who catches what stocks, where and when.""Labour meanwhile has criticised the political declaration as ""26 vague and ambitious pages of buzzwords"".Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird said the document ""makes a mockery"" of the ""red line"" set down by the Scottish Tories, saying that ""David Mundell must resign with immediate effect, and his colleagues must make clear that they will not support this half-baked deal""."

She made changes within weeks of being promoted to Nicola Sturgeon's Cabinet and went on to set out a three-year plan, backed with £850m of funding, in a bid to meet a series of key waiting time targets for NHS Scotland.She also announced NHS board debts were being written off as part of the introduction of a new medium-term financial framework.Speaking after being given the prize at an awards ceremony at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel, Ms Freeman said: ""I've come a long way from being a student communist, haven't I, and it was a fine discipline to learn.""One of the things you learn when you move on from that discipline is the point of politics is to make a difference, and the make a difference you have to get elected.""She added: ""The point of politics is to make a difference, that's why we do it. We shouldn't do it to be somebody, we should do it to do something.""Labour's Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney won Best Scot at Westminster, in part in recognition for his lobbying of the UK government in immigration cases such as that of Giorgi Kakava, a 10-year-old orphan who had been threatened with deportation following the death of his mother.While Mr Russell lost out on the top prize, he was named as the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year after spending much of his last year taking on the Tories over Brexit.Meanwhile former minister Bruce Crawford was honoured as the Committee MSP of the Year after the finance and constitution committee he chairs sat through marathon sessions scrutinising the Scottish government's Brexit continuity bill.Kate Forbes, who was made Digital Economy Minister was named as the One to Watch following both her promotion to the government and her campaigning efforts to try to end the use of plastic drinking straws.Efforts to tackle the problem of everyday Islamophobia by Labour MSP Anas Sarwar saw him receive the award for Community MSP of the Year, with Mr Sarwar having set up a cross party group at Holyrood as part of this work.Meanwhile, Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser was given the Politics in Business Award, and Ms Sturgeon was awarded the E-Politician of the Year for her effective use of Twitter, and Dundee City Council leader John Alexander was named Scottish Local Politician of the Year."
2018-11-23,Reality Check: What's in the Brexit political declaration?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46303751,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe draft political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, after Brexit, is out. Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK.A few points to remember… This is not a legally binding document.It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified).This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes.Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019.It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come. Here's an initial look at what's in the text:A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours. Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead.Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like. And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate.The bottom line of both parties is included early on. Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated.So trade in goods should be ""as close as possible"", but that's not the same as being frictionless. It leaves a lot of wiggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome. The two sides are committing themselves to an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement. But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition. The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up.When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit. Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world. The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"".The declaration also mentions explicitly an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK in the future.We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open. That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long. The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world.UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come. It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between. But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific. As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of ""equivalence"" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020. There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim. There are also plenty of aspirational words on ""ambitious and comprehensive"" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate.There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data. The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy. But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state.This fulfils the Prime Minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays. There is neutral language here, including the ""best endeavours"" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal. But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters. Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest.There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome. We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future. Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel. But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice. The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end. There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on. Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable. Read more from Reality CheckSend us your questionsFollow us on Twitter"

It hasn't been painless - two cabinet ministers and two junior ministers resigned while some Conservative MPs want to force a leadership contest. What happens now?The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. Mrs May announced that a deal had been reached, and approved by cabinet, last week. But two cabinet ministers have since resigned.The deal would also need to get the stamp of approval from MPs and, finally, the 27 other EU member states. A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union - including how much money will be paid to the EU, a 21-month transition period after Brexit day next March and commitments on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU. It is not a trade deal - that will be hammered out during the transition period, if all goes as planned. They have also agreed to the text of a separate, shorter 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, including the kind of trade deal the two sides want.Alongside the 585-page withdrawal agreement is that 26-page ""political declaration"" setting out what future UK and EU relations will look like.  This is a broad outline and is not binding - the details of a trade deal will be worked out during the transition period with both the EU and UK hoping to have an agreement in place by December 2020.The political declaration envisages ""a free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"". There would be ""ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement.The two sides say they want this new arrangement to solve the Irish border problem, removing the need for that troublesome backstop. Here's our Reality Check team's view of the key points of the declarationThis was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But this bit is controversial - Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules, and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.The role of the European Court of Justice - which will still have jurisdiction in the UK on customs and single market rules - could also spark protests.Mrs May says she does not want to have to use the backstop at all - and the withdrawal agreement says the UK and the EU will resolve to ensure it is not necessary by coming up with alternative arrangements.They could also extend the transition if there is no long-term solution in place by July 2020 - but only once.Dominic Raab resigned as Brexit secretary, telling BBC News he quit the cabinet over ""fatal flaws"" in the draft withdrawal agreement. He added the UK should be ready to risk a no-deal Brexit in the face of EU ""blackmail"". Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey and junior Brexit minister Suella Braverman have also quit, as have Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a ministerial aide at the education department, and Ranil Jayawardena, a ministerial aide at the justice department. Others to go were Northern Ireland minister Shailesh Vara and Rehman Chishti, the MP for Gillingham and Rainham, announced his resignation as vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and also as the prime minister's trade envoy to Pakistan.A number of Conservatives have said publicly that they have written letters to Sir Graham Brady - the chair of the 1922 Committee, made up of backbench MPs - saying they have no confidence in Mrs May's leadership. These include the head of the pro-Brexit European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and former minister John Whittingdale. Party rules say that if Sir Graham receives 48 letters - the equivalent of 15% of MPs - it will trigger a vote of confidence.If Mrs May wins that a secret ballot, she would be immune from another challenge for a year. But if she lost, there would be a leadership contest, and she would not be able to stand. Sir Graham will not reveal the number of letters he receives until he gets to that magic number. More than a week after the rebels went public it seems they have failed to get to the 48 figure.It is not yet clear how any of this will affect Brexit and the outcome of talks.An emergency EU summit is due to be held on 25 November, where EU leaders are expected to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration.If it hasn't been tricky enough already for Mrs May, probably the most difficult part comes if and when the UK government and the EU have agreed on their preferred Brexit deal.She then has to persuade MPs to vote for it. Any vote is expected to take place in the first half of December.Mrs May does not have a Commons majority and many MPs on her own side - as well as Labour and the other opposition parties - are sceptical about her Brexit plans, or openly hostile to them. The DUP, which Mrs May relies on in key votes, has already said it is likely to vote against it, claiming it will lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. A number of Conservative MPs on both the Remain and Leave wings of the party have also said they will vote against it.If Mrs May loses the vote, we enter uncharted territory. She may seek to renegotiate with the EU but most expect her time in No 10 to end. There could be a general election and/or a new prime minister.Some Tory and Labour MPs hope Mrs May will head that off by postponing Brexit day and calling another referendum, something she has consistently ruled out. On Thursday EU leaders played down talk of renegotiating the deal, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying there was ""no question"" of reopening talks. Mrs May herself said that if MPs did not unite behind the agreement, ""nobody can know for sure the consequences that will follow"" and it would mean taking ""a path of deep and grave uncertainty"".

Soon, perhaps in the second week of December, the House of Commons will debate and then vote upon a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion. This week, the new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons ""will stop no deal"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be"". And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was ""no majority for any route forward"". Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out. Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference? More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament. Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.The Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But perhaps there will be a general election instead? That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act and both involve motions of confidence in the Commons. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem."" That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period (and Number 10 has ruled that out) the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight. The clock won't wait. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  "
2018-11-23,Post-Brexit Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20181123202922/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46302931,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe prospect of Brexit looms large in Berlin these days and people are not happy about it.  ""We lose Britain, and we keep Italy: it's grotesque"", one former minister commented ruefully to me.That barbed remark lays bare a real anxiety among Germans, that somehow the European Union's centre of gravity will shift once the UK has gone, that a delicate balance will be upset, and it will not be in Berlin's favour.Identifying Italy hints at one source of concern, that the southern Europeans will want to carry in their free spending way. What was for a long time the subtext of European debates, that Germany can be expected to subsidise the others because of war guilt as well as the strength of its economy, became increasingly overt during the Greek debt crisis. Now Italy, with far larger debts, is on a budgetary collision course with the EU.There is though another aspect to the comments one hears these days about how the post-Brexit EU might function, and it hints at a deeper and more emotive schism. If a generation of German politicians has hailed the European project as a triumph for peace this was at least in part because it has provided a way of converting long rivalry with France from the cause of 20th Century wars to the 'engine' of the Continent's economic success. Now though one hears disparagement of France and its president Emanuel Macron from different political quarters. A senior German journalist, commenting on the prominence given to Angela Merkel's meetings with President Macron to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice, said to me, anger in her voice, ""you see? This is our future, this will have to be our future partner, because you are leaving"".Meeting Alexander Gauland, leader of the right wing Alternative for Germany party in his spectacular office overlooking the Reichstag, he too cannot hold back on the subject on France.  ""The British are the only believers in free trade,"" he told us in a Newsnight interview, ""the French are bureaucratic in a way we don't like in our party"".Of course there are still pro-French voices in German politics, including those who feel that Chancellor Merkel has missed a real opportunity to build the Eurozone by spurning Mr Macron's proposals for further financial integration. But in my recent contacts at least, I have noticed rather more members of the German establishment who reject what the president stands for, suspecting another attempt to get Germany to finance French public spending and worrying about the destabilizing effect of Brexit.""For decades there has been a delicate triangle of power running Europe,"" the former minister quoted earlier says, ""and with Berlin, Paris, and London each playing their own distinctive role"". His concern is that removing the UK, with its big contributions to European security and financial prudence will lead to bigger problems for the EU. Germany, even during the long Merkel years, has been diffident about playing the leadership role in Europe. It is comfortable with tactical interventions on monetary or political matters, much less so in flexing diplomatic or military muscle. The prospect of Brexit has brought the realization that France may now try to fill this vacuum. While many German politicians are uneasy about the idea of leading Europe, it seems that the idea of letting President Macron (who one person I was talking to this week in Berlin called, ""a charlatan"") play that role by default disturbs them. Indeed it may rankle so much that it causes Germany to abandon its post Second World War reluctance to exert its power in Europe.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates.Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father, is a former Conservative MEP and founder of Environmentalists for Europe, who believes the UK would be better off remaining in the EU.Ella Whelan, author and journalist at Spiked, staunchly believes in Brexit.They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting.But did they get on?How would you describe yourself? Barely blonde public-school boy. What are your views on Brexit? In the run-up to Brexit, I was very much for Remain. However, when Britain voted, I said, ""OK, we're going to leave."" But I am absolutely not in favour of Brexit along the terms the government is discussing. What was your initial impression? A real pleasure to meet her and obviously a first-class brain there. I found it hard to keep up, actually.How was your date? Lively stuff - it did me a lot of good to be exposed to someone who was deeply committed to the Brexit deal.What was the best thing about the date? The sausages were very good. What was the worst thing? Possibly being forced to concentrate for about two hours.What did you talk about? I argued that during my time in the EU, it was in a way quite exciting to be able to use the EU mechanisms to drive through projects and programmes and political decisions which it might have been harder to get through if you just worked at a national level, country by country.What was her most convincing argument? She did convince me that there are a lot of people out there who take Brexit very seriously indeed - it's not just a political football to be kicked around. Even if it did come to a second vote... I don't think that the Remainers would necessarily find it any easier to win the argument than they did last time round. Did you convince her on anything? Well I very much doubt that. That would be a first. I don't think I've ever convinced anyone about anything.Would you see her again? Absolutely, with great pleasure.Describe her in three words: Intelligent, articulate, attractive. Marks out of 10 for the date: Sounds a bit like Strictly Come Dancing - I'd give it an eight or a nine because I was intrigued and absorbed and actually fairly challenged by our discussion.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.What was your initial impression? A very, very, charming man - I was a little intimidated as he has been an MEP and is very knowledgeable in relation to the EU but we got on very well. How was your date? It went well, we agreed more than I thought we would, which was a nice surprise because it meant that we could actually talk about some of the finer points rather than going at each other's throats.What was the best thing about the date? Being taken out by a gentleman was a very nice thing to do. What was the worst thing? That we didn't get to finish the dinners because we were talking about Brexit too much. What did you talk about? We talked about the Irish border a lot, which I think is one of the most interesting things for me about looking at what's gone wrong with the Brexit discussion.Any common ground? We both agreed that what has happened to Brexit is a terrible sham.What was your biggest disagreement? We really disagreed on immigration and not how you'd think because I'm very pro-immigration and Stanley is quite anti it because he is very concerned about population growth. In another discussion, about immigration, we may not have got along as well as we did.Did he convince you on anything? No, but that's not because he wasn't thoughtful but because I think that this debate is the centre of my political outlook, so it would take more than an earthquake to change my mind on this. Would you see him again? We come from totally different backgrounds but sometimes once in a while that works. And he's a gentleman, so yes, why not?Describe him in three words: Charming, ardent and patient. Marks out of 10 for the date: Nine, because the conversation was very interesting but we didn't get to finish our dinner.

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

UK Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Brussels to hold talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit.Meanwhile, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become a ""satellite state"" under the deal. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU.Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition.Spain had raised last-minute objections ahead of the summit about how the issue of Gibraltar had been handled in the Brexit talks so far.But EU leaders secured a compromise with the Spanish prime minister, who said that Europe and the UK ""had accepted the conditions set down by Spain"" and so would ""vote in favour of Brexit"".Mr Tusk, who represents EU leaders on the world stage, said he recommended ""that we approve on Sunday the outcome of the Brexit negotiations"" in a letter to members of the European Council.He added: ""No-one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time, the EU 27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity."" Mrs May will meet the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Mr Tusk for talks later.Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it.A vote is expected in December. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives.BBC News political correspondent Ben Wright has said Mrs May ""faces an incredibly hard job"" getting the deal passed by MPs.Spain threatened to derail the Brexit deal over concerns about its role in future trade arrangements involving Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents.But the UK published a letter it had sent to Spain reassuring it over the withdrawal agreement.After holding emergency talks with Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, the Spanish prime minister dropped his threat. Mr Sanchez said: ""Gibraltar is excluded from the general negotiation of the European Union with the United Kingdom. ""This gives the chance to Spain to have direct negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar."" Spain's foreign minister Josep Borrell said the assurance was ""the most important"" development since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which ceded Gibraltar to Britain.But BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that the UK's letter does not contain anything substantially different from the withdrawal agreement.He said there was a suspicion that Spanish ministers were ""showboating a little for the domestic electorate"" on the eve of elections in Andalusia, in the south of Spain, where Gibraltar is a significant issue.Theresa May said discussions with Spain have been ""constructive and sensible"" but that the UK's position on Gibraltar will not change.She said: ""I'm proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar.""The former foreign secretary told Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) conference that the UK was on the verge of ""making a historic mistake"".Mr Johnson said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and there was still time to work for a better deal.Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament.But Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely vital that we keep this partnership going"" to avoid Labour coming to power.The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.Please upgrade your browserDUP leader Arlene Foster told her party conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used.She urged the government to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland, adding: ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say.""Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU.He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"".He added that he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP.On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.But Mrs May declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"".

There has been political opposition among unionists to the government's plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border.It would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules if it took effect.European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday.The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea.Mr Johnson is one of two senior Conservative MPs to appear at the conference this weekend, after Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke on Friday night.""We must agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland,"" he said.The former foreign secretary said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and that there is still time to work for a better deal.""In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road,"" he added, to applause. He said he hoped the DUP and Conservatives could continue working together, ""backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us"".by Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterWhat do Star Wars, sardines and the Titanic all have in common?Answer: They all somehow ended up getting a mention in Boris Johnson's speech at the DUP conference (yes, really).It certainly wasn't a normal party conference, but these are unusual times. There was standing room only as the politician, who often brings a rock star flavour to events, took to the stage.That being said, while much of what he said received roars of applause, my colleague Gareth Gordon noticed one woman asleep in the front row.But even getting Mr Johnson to appear at the conference will be seen as a victory for the DUP, in its attempt to resist the government's path for Brexit. Before party leader Arlene Foster was announced to the stage, one DUP councillor described her as ""a lady who's not for turning"".But with Theresa May also holding firm against the DUP's opposition to the backstop so far, soon enough someone's going to have to give.Mr Johnson also suggested the creation of a secretary of state for ""no deal"" on World Trade Organisation terms, ""with real powers across Whitehall to make things happen"". ""I do not believe that we will exit without a deal - that is totally unnecessary - but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations,"" he added.Mrs Foster told her party's conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used.The government has said it is looking at alternative arrangements to ensure the backstop is a last resort.But, Mrs Foster said there were ""many contradictions"" in the draft withdrawal agreement.She said she understood the position of many in the business community, who have urged DUP MPs to back the deal.But she added that the party could not wish away proposals that it believes are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland's economy or interests.""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say,"" she said.Ahead of the party conference, Mrs Foster warned that if the deal gets passed in parliament, her party may have to revisit its confidence-and-supply pact with the Conservatives.The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament.It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure.On Saturday, she said ""the DUP had never been afraid to say yes when it is right to do so, nor to say no when required"".Earlier, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party would ""stand firm in the face of inevitable onslaught"" in opposing the government's Brexit plan.Mr Dodds told the party's conference: ""Prime minister - bin the backstop.""Mr Dodds told the conference that the union is ""non-negotiable"".He described Theresa May's draft plan as portraying a ""pitiful and pathetic place for the United Kingdom"".The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario.Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but ""not a deal at any price"".On Friday, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.The government of Gibraltar is also represented at the DUP conference. Gibraltar has become involved in the Brexit debate as Spain sought written assurances from the UK that it would be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory.Donald Tusk recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit.On Saturday, the government of Gibraltar said the territory ""will not fold"" over Brexit and staunchly supports the union.Housing and equality minister Samantha Sacramento told the DUP conference Gibraltar would ""not be bullied"".The chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, was due to attend but could not make it because of the ongoing Brexit negotiations.Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly (96%) to remain in the EU."

Sir John - a Eurosceptic - has told the Sun that the honour has no bearing on how he will vote on the deal.Speaking to his local newspaper, Spalding Today, Sir John said he was ""immensely proud"" to receive the knighthood.""I am very proud to be MP for the area in which I live - I see it as something for everyone in the area, not just for me,"" he said.Congratulations Sir John and Lady Susan on John’s well deserved  knighthood.

She was speaking on Radio Ulster's Inside Politics programme.The DUP is holding its annual conference this weekend.""If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then of course that brings us to the situation of looking again at the confidence and supply deal. ""But we are not there yet,"" she said.The DUP leader insisted the government should ""ditch the Irish backstop"" and recognise that, in practice, nobody will implement a hard border on the island of Ireland. She argued that the prospect of such a hard border has taken on a ""mythical status"" in the Brexit negotiations.Mrs Foster argued that the EU Withdrawal Agreement as it stands will not get the support of parliament. Instead of ""wasting time"" on the agreement, she said Mrs May should try to secure a better deal. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is one of two Conservative MPs to attend the DUP party conference in Belfast this weekend.Mr Hammond spoke at a dinner on Friday night.Earlier, he told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the ""parliamentary process"", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop.""I would much prefer to see us extending the implementation period and I am sure my DUP colleagues would take the same view,"" he said.""So we need to look at how we can provide reassurance about how we will use the options that the agreement gives us.""Boris Johnson will give a speech to the conference on Saturday afternoon.Mrs Foster said the reference to the potential use of technology to monitor cross-border trade in the latest EU-UK Political Declaration does not change her party's objections to Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement. She said it would have been much better if both the EU and the UK had explored potential technological solutions to maintaining smooth cross-border trade in the summer of last year, when unionists previously championed the idea. Mrs  Foster said the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding and have the status of an international treaty, so it remains important to the DUP that nothing contained in it damages the UK constitutionally or economically.Inside Politics is on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday at 18:05 GMT and Saturday at 13:35 GMT."

The shadow home secretary said she was ""as sure as anyone can be"" that ""the referendum vote will be honoured and we will come out of the EU next spring"".But she repeated her warning that those urging a new referendum should should ""be careful what they wish for"".""My view is that ...Leave would win again,"" she told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast.""And not only would Leave win again but Leave voters would say: 'What didn't you understand about Leave the first time?'"" At the Labour Party conference in September, party members approved a motion that would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote - but said last week that a new referendum was ""an option for the future"" but ""not an option for today"".The People's Vote campaign group, which organised a march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people, wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal.But Labour says it would prefer to see a general election, if Theresa May loses the ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal.Asked how that could come about, as the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour of an election, or go through a no-confidence procedure, Ms Abbott said: ""This is an era of things that you never thought could happen, are happening and whatever the legislation says, in the end, Parliament disposes and Parliament proposes.""She said she had been an MP through parliamentary ""turmoil"" under Margaret Thatcher and John Major but added: ""I have never seen anything like this and there is a tiny bit of me which thinks this might all end in a general election. It's not clear how that would happen but you can't escape thinking about that.""Earlier this week, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour could form a minority government, without a general election.Ms Abbott was asked whether Labour would ally itself with the DUP - the Northern Ireland Unionist party which has been supporting Theresa May's government in key Commons votes.She said: ""We would only want to ally with a group of MPs who agreed with us on the issues at stake. At this point, we don't agree with the DUP on the issues at stake, but in this sort of parliamentary turmoil you can't necessarily rule anything out.""I always say to my MP colleagues that the people of Hackney send me to Parliament to get rid of the Tories and if it's all about getting rid of this Tory government you do what it takes."""
2018-11-24,MPs begin debate on gender recognition laws,https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320431,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA debate on trans and women's rights is raging in the LGBT and feminist communities.  The focal point? Possible reforms to the 2004 Gender Recognition Act in England and Wales. Now, for the first time, MPs have formally debated the issue in Parliament. And it's in Parliament where a decision will eventually be made on what to do next.The government has been consulting on whether the current system, whereby someone can legally change their gender, is too clinical, bureaucratic and intrusive. The answer from some is an emphatic yes. The leading LGBT campaign group Stonewall is among those calling for a simpler, more streamlined process.The Scottish government has also said it is committed to reform and has just published some analysis following its own consultation. To change a birth certificate a person currently has to:But there are those with deep concerns - including numerous feminist and women's groups who say they feel vilified and marginalised in this debate. And in a Westminster Hall debate this week, the Conservative MP David TC Davies suggested that the potential reforms might mean ""a 15-stone bearded man could simply define themselves as female and there would be nothing anybody could do to object to this"". He said that, being a ""libertarian"", this wasn't necessarily a problem in itself. But the issue, for some, arises out of a fear that by making it easier to redefine a person's gender, it will be easier to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and even women's refuges.  And that there might be people who will do so for nefarious purposes.But Mr Davies struck a lonely figure around the debating table as MPs from Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats opposed him. Among them, Layla Moran (Liberal Democrat) said that a ""moral panic"" had been ""whipped up to demonise a community"". She said there was nothing to suggest that a person would soon be able to switch genders ""on a whim"" one afternoon.We will have to wait to see what the government's proposals are before it is clear how far the reforms might go. It is worth noting that the 2010 Equality Act protects trans people from discrimination, meaning that someone who identifies as a woman can already access female-only spaces.However, the same legislation also allows services, such as domestic abuse shelters, to exercise a level of discretion on who can access those services.But the case of Karen White, a transgender prisoner who sexually assaulted fellow inmates, is being frequently cited as an example of how the law is already letting women down. This week, Women's Minister Victoria Atkins blamed ""a series of terrible failings that should never have happened"". She said that the Ministry of Justice is reviewing the case as well as the wider protocols in place.The government is expected to announce its next steps on the Gender Recognition Act in spring 2019, once officials have gone through over 100,000 consultation responses. Victoria Atkins emphasised that no decisions have yet been made. But it's clear that the government is inclined towards reform, mindful of its pledge to help improve the lives of LGBT people and tackle transphobia. Any changes will need to go through Parliament, which means this week's Westminster Hall discussion could end up being considerably amplified once it hits the Commons floor where there are currently no trans MPs.Law can underpin culture and culture will influence law. Here a question about birth certificates has been absorbed into a much broader, and contentious, discussion about what it means to be a woman.It poses a difficult question: by enhancing the rights of one community, do you diminish the rights of another? There will be those who say that is totally false premise; that trans rights and women's rights are not in conflict. But the fact that conflict exists on this issue is undeniable and it looks like Parliament will soon have to fully enter the fray."

One had said, even if Mr Segalov was not involved, he ""did not intervene or walk away"" while the other said the fact he was there suggested he was ""willing to engage in or with those who took direct action"".But Lord Justice Simon said: ""The issue of how a journalist should react when faced, at close quarters, with criminal activity is not straightforward.""It is sufficient to say that, in this case, we do not consider the fact that the claimant 'did not intervene or walk away' was a matter that could properly be taken into account to his discredit.""Mr Segalov said the ruling was ""reassuring"" adding: ""The unfair and secret process by which police have until now decided who can and cannot attend party conferences won't be allowed to continue anymore.""If unchallenged, the police's attempts to criminalise journalistic activity by the police suggested journalists should be held responsible for what they report on.""Thankfully the court confirmed what I had attempted to explain to the police all along.""The court dismissed a challenge by Mr Segalov against Greater Manchester Police, who manage the national accreditation scheme for large events, saying it had simply passed on the decision of Sussex Police to the Labour Party."
2018-11-24,UKIP leader defends hiring Tommy Robinson,https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46308160,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUKIP leader Gerard Batten has defended his decision to hire Tommy Robinson as an adviser and says he had saved the party ""from oblivion"".His predecessor Nigel Farage criticised UKIP's association with the ex-English Defence League leader and said there should be a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten.Mr Batten said many people respected Mr Robinson's ""stand on things"".And he claimed Mr Farage had shown ""0% interest"" in UKIP since ""walking away"". Mr Batten, who is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Mr Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum, said he believed he would see off any challenge to his leadership. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, will advise him on rape gangs and prison reform.In May, the 35-year old former EDL leader was jailed for 13 months for contempt of court, which sparked a series of #freeTommy protests.His conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns and the case has now been referred to the attorney general. Mr Robinson had previously been sentenced to 18 months in jail in January 2014 for mortgage fraud and for 10 months in January 2013 for a passport offence.Asked whether it was appropriate to take advice from someone with a criminal record, Mr Batten said those with ""minor convictions"" deserved a second chance. He told BBC News that Tommy Robinson was a ""high profile"" figure who had been ""persecuted by the state because of his views"".""I think he's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage.""He rejected concerns expressed by Mr Farage and other MEPs, several of whom have quit the party in recent months, that UKIP was becoming tainted with Islamophobia. ""Islamophobic is a made up word… I don't have an irrational fear of Islam, nor does Tommy Robinson.""Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today earlier that, under his leadership, the party had talked about mass immigration and extreme forms of Islam but ""as a non-racist, non-sectarian party"".""This blows a hole in all of that.""While he had not ""given up"" on UKIP, he said he would be writing to the party's ruling National Executive Committee urging a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten as leader and ""that we get rid of him"". ""We can have one last go at getting rid of somebody who as leader is dragging us in a shameful direction.""But Mr Batten said he believed he had the support of UKIP's NEC after rescuing the party from potential financial collapse. He suggested Mr Farage was now more interested in his role with Leave Means Leave, the pro-Brexit campaign group, than UKIP.""It's down to me that this party has survived, not Nigel Farage nor anybody else,"" he said. ""Nigel walked away from UKIP two years ago and hasn't shown any interest in it since.""UKIP was still in the vanguard of the Brexit fight, he argued, and Mr Robinson's presence would increase numbers at a demonstration the party was planning next month. On Sunday, UKIP's NEC deferred a decision on allowing members to vote on Mr Robinson joining the party.The decision was postponed until after 29 March 2019 - the day the UK is due to leave the EU - with the NEC arguing the party should be focused on Brexit.Currently, UKIP has a blanket ban on allowing former members of the British National Party and the EDL from joining the party - meaning Mr Robinson is barred.Last week, some UKIP members of the Welsh Assembly said Mr Robinson should not be allowed to join."
2018-11-24,Government exploring 'extra DUP assurances',https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46302720,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop, Chancellor Phillip Hammond has said.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.Some MPs, including those in the DUP, have said they will not back the government's Brexit deal because of the backstop proposal.It would see only NI stay aligned to some EU rules, if it came into effect.Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the ""parliamentary process"", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop. The backstop is an insurance policy to ensure frictionless trade across the Irish border after Brexit, if no other solution can be found as part of a wider deal with the EU.The DUP has repeatedly said it will not accept any extra checks only in Northern Ireland, and has vowed to vote against the deal in the Commons.It has led to tension with the Conservative Party, and put the confidence and supply deal the parties share under huge strain.The parties signed the pact in June 2017, with the DUP securing more than £1bn of extra funding for Northern Ireland, in exchange for its 10 MPs supporting the government on key votes in Parliament.On Monday, the party abstained on budget votes, in a bid to warn Theresa May to scrap the backstop proposal.But Mr Hammond told BBC News NI he believes his party's confidence and supply deal with the DUP will stay intact. He is due to speak at the start of the DUP's annual conference on Friday evening, while leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson will speak to DUP members on Saturday - traditionally viewed as a more high-profile slot in annual party conferences.DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mr Hammond would be welcomed at his party's annual conference in Belfast, despite his party's differences with the government.""I think the fact that we have brought Philip Hammond and Boris Johnson across knocks on the head the idea that some people have been putting around that we have closed our minds and our ears to listening to all sides of the argument,"" Mr Wilson said.But Mr Wilson said it was ""not our fault"" if the media gave more prominence to Mr Johnson, and said it was apt that Mr Hammond would address an audience that will include many members of the business community. The Chancellor said the DUP and Conservatives ""don't always agree on everything but I'm sure we'll sort it out, we are two parties that agree fundamentally on the importance of maintaining the union"".Asked if the prime minister could survive in office if parliament rejects her deal, the chancellor said now was a time to bring the country back together and ""Theresa May is the right person do that"".During his visit, Mr Hammond also announced that funding of £66m is to be released by the Treasury so that 23 shared and integrated schools in Northern Ireland can continue with building (capital) projects.The money is from a pot of £500m that was first approved in the Stormont House agreement in 2014 and re-affirmed in the Fresh Start Agreement in November 2015.Earlier this year, BBC News NI revealed that unspent money totalling £91m for shared and integrated education from the agreements would be made available. Mr Hammond then headed to an event led by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).Meanwhile his cabinet colleague, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, has said language in the draft UK-EU political declaration, which refers to looking at technology to address the Irish border, is ""encouraging"".He made the remarks during a visit to a business in Newry, County Down, on Friday.Mr Fox, who backed leave in the referendum, said despite opposition to the draft withdrawal agreement, that ""this is a bullet we have to bite"".International Trade Sec Liam Fox arriving @LtdMJM in Newry pic.twitter.com/7OmM9og8ifEnd of Twitter post  by @JP_Biz""People in parliament will have to take a decision on whether they are going to block the democratic decision of the public.""He said the government's aim was to ensure ""we never get to the backstop"", and that he hoped that issue would be addressed through the future relationship.""The paper we published yesterday sets out a number of alternative arrangements to deal with the border, which is a big improvement on where we've been before"".""It shows shows building trust and we can avoid ever getting to the backstop,"" added Mr Fox.But he suggested Great Britain could have issues negotiating trade deals with new partners if the backstop arrangement came into effect.The cabinet minister also did not rule out extending Article 50 if Parliament votes down the government's draft Brexit plan.But he said: ""We've always said we didn't want to extend Article 50 - we need to come to an agreement."""
2018-11-24,EU embalming ban 'to change funerals',https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46294432,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowGrieving loved ones may no longer be able to pay their last respects to dead relatives when the EU bans the chemical in embalming fluid.That is the fear of Britain's funeral directors after MEPs voted to restrict the use of formaldehyde.The EU says it will protect workers' health and save lives.And - in a concession secured by a Conservative MEP - it has delayed the ban on the substance for three years to allow the industry to adjust.If the UK remains in the EU single market for 21 months after it officially leaves on 29 March, as is currently planned, then the government would be expected to transpose the directive into UK law within a strict time limit.The Health and Safety Executive said it would welcome any measures to help controls but is trying to get more time for the funeral industry to adjust.A HSE spokesman said: ""This is not a ban on formaldehyde. The European Commission has proposed formalising exposure limits.""Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen that requires close regulation, which the funeral sector has always taken into account. As is the current case, it will still be used in a controlled manner. ""As a responsible regulator we have always worked closely with the funeral industry to understand its particular needs. This has informed our discussions at EU level. ""Our dialogue with the sector on the proposed limits will continue whatever the terms of our departure from the European Union."" The HSE said the three-year exemption period would come on top of the usual two-year implementation period for a new regulation to come into force, meaning it will not apply to the funeral sector for five years.Funeral directors in the UK are concerned they will not be able to find a replacement for formaldehyde and that they will be faced with extra costs.Formaldehyde, which can cause irritation and has been linked to nasopharyngeal cancer, is one of five industrial chemicals to be added to the European Commission's list of restricted carcinogens and mutagens. The UK funeral industry says it recognises that formaldehyde, which is also used in hospitals and in a wide variety of industrial processes, has been linked to serious illnesses.But it argues that the chemical does not pose a significant risk to workers in the diluted form, known as formalin, used by embalmers.And if an alternative to formalin cannot be found, then the ""culture"" around Christian burials and cremations in the UK, will have to change, with funeral directors advising more families against seeing their loved one in the coffin, although ultimately it is the family's choice whether to do so. The embalming of bodies is prohibited in the Jewish and Muslim faiths. It is not forbidden in Hinduism but is rare because cremation normally takes place within 24 hours of death.The funeral industry estimates between 50% and 55% of cadavers in the UK undergo some form of embalming so they can be viewed by relatives. The practice has become more prevalent in recent years because of the growing length of time between death and funeral, caused by delays in obtaining paperwork.""Visiting a loved one in the chapel of rest can be both a distressing and comforting experience for families, and it is also proven to be an important part of the grieving process,"" says Jon Levett, chief executive of the National Association of Funeral Directors. ""For funeral directors, embalming offers the only realistic solution that will delay deterioration and present the deceased person at peace and as close to their appearance before death as possible; particularly where there has been a post mortem, examination, traumatic death - or to accommodate the increasing gap between death and a funeral which is now often two or three weeks. ""For all of these reasons, embalming remains a common funeral choice in the UK by families, much more so than in Europe.""He welcomed the three-year delay in the implementation of the EU directive to ""allow funeral firms to continue the search for a feasible alternative"" but suggested the UK may need to ""change the culture around funerals to make the need for embalming redundant"". All the alternatives to formalin tried so far ""simply do not work as a preservative"", he added. West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre, who this week secured the three-year exemption in a vote in the European Parliament, said: ""This new legislation is well meant, but I don't think officials in Brussels realised quite how big the impact would be on Britain.""Refrigeration has been used as an alternative to embalming but that can lead to dehydrated remains and, with repeated thawing and refreezing, accelerated decay, leading to ""an unwholesome viewing situation"", a briefing note by the funeral industry said.""For the close viewing of the deceased to take place, it is essential for the deceased to be embalmed so the person viewing is safe (free from the hazard of infection), and that the deceased's remains are fixed and stable and do not chemically break down or decompose and/or release embarrassing odours from decomposition,"" it added.The European Commission says setting maximum values for the concentration in workplace air of the five chemicals added to its list will improve conditions for more than 1,000,000 EU workers and prevent more than 22,000 work-related illnesses over the next 50 years. The Council of Ministers in Brussels is due to vote in the issue on 6 December - and the Health and Safety Executive is hoping it will be agreed."
2018-11-24,UK 'will not trade away fishing' to EU,https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46303911,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe UK government has insisted its Brexit agreement will protect the fishing industry despite claims it is preparing to ""sell out"" fishermen.The government's draft agreement on post-Brexit relations says the UK will be an ""independent coastal nation"".The Scottish Fishermen's Federation gave the document a cautious welcome when it was published on Thursday. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon predicted the industry would be used as a ""bargaining chip"" in the future. And Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson, a prominent Brexiteer who has been an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Theresa May's approach to Brexit, said the agreement was ""unacceptable"" as it meant ""sovereignty over our waters"" would be ""sacrificed for a trade deal"". The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is deeply unpopular with Scottish fishermen who want the UK to be negotiating access and quota rights as an independent coastal state by the end of 2020.All 13 Scottish Conservative MPs - including Scottish Secretary David Mundell - warned Mrs May last week that anything less than this would be a ""betrayal of Scotland"". They said they could not support any deal with the EU that would ""prevent the UK from independently negotiating access and quota shares"" as this would mean ""we would not be leaving the CFP in practice"". The final draft of the political declaration - a text outlining the future relationship between the EU and the UK after Brexit - contains neutral language about fishing.It says both sides will ""use their best endeavours"" to conclude talks in time for the UK to leave, and adds that they should cooperate on access to waters and quota shares ""within the context of the overall economic partnership"".Mr Thomson and Ms Sturgeon both argue that the latter point shows ministers could use fishing as a ""bargaining chip"" in negotiations with Europe post-Brexit, and both have called on Mr Mundell to consider his position.The first minister told MSPs that the declaration ""represents another Tory sell out of Scottish fishermen"".She said: ""What we see is that the Scottish fishing industry will be used as a bargaining chip in wider trade talks.""In terms of David Mundell's position I would simply say this - his position is a matter for him, but if David Mundell is still in office by the end of today in light of this political declaration he will have forfeited forever any last remaining scrap of principle or credibility that he had.""🐟The political declaration commits UK to ""establish a new fisheries agreement on, inter allia, access to waters and quota shares"". This means sovereignty over our waters sacrificed for a trade deal. That is unacceptable. We must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway. pic.twitter.com/wRCzdSNahfEnd of Twitter post  by @RossThomson_MPThe Scottish Secretary hit back, saying he was ""not taking lessons on standing up for fishermen from Nicola Sturgeon"".He said: ""The prime minister has fiercely resisted the efforts of EU states to make an explicit link between access to our waters and access to markets.""We will negotiate and decide, as an independent coastal state, on access and quota on an annual basis, just like Norway and Iceland do now.""The surest way to guarantee the EU access to Scottish waters would be to rejoin the CFP - exactly what Nicola Sturgeon is demanding.""Mrs May told MPs later in the day that ""the fisheries agreement is not something we will be trading off against any other priorities"".The government has won some backing from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, with chief executive Bertie Armstrong saying the declaration ""gives the UK the power to assert its position as an independent coastal state with practical sovereignty over our waters and natural resources"".However he added that ""we know that several EU nations will not give up their attempts to link access with trade in order to retain absolute rights to fish around our coastline"".He added: ""We will continue to seek assurances from the UK government that it will remain steadfast.

She made changes within weeks of being promoted to Nicola Sturgeon's Cabinet and went on to set out a three-year plan, backed with £850m of funding, in a bid to meet a series of key waiting time targets for NHS Scotland.She also announced NHS board debts were being written off as part of the introduction of a new medium-term financial framework.Speaking after being given the prize at an awards ceremony at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel, Ms Freeman said: ""I've come a long way from being a student communist, haven't I, and it was a fine discipline to learn.""One of the things you learn when you move on from that discipline is the point of politics is to make a difference, and the make a difference you have to get elected.""She added: ""The point of politics is to make a difference, that's why we do it. We shouldn't do it to be somebody, we should do it to do something.""Labour's Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney won Best Scot at Westminster, in part in recognition for his lobbying of the UK government in immigration cases such as that of Giorgi Kakava, a 10-year-old orphan who had been threatened with deportation following the death of his mother.While Mr Russell lost out on the top prize, he was named as the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year after spending much of his last year taking on the Tories over Brexit.Meanwhile former minister Bruce Crawford was honoured as the Committee MSP of the Year after the finance and constitution committee he chairs sat through marathon sessions scrutinising the Scottish government's Brexit continuity bill.Kate Forbes, who was made Digital Economy Minister was named as the One to Watch following both her promotion to the government and her campaigning efforts to try to end the use of plastic drinking straws.Efforts to tackle the problem of everyday Islamophobia by Labour MSP Anas Sarwar saw him receive the award for Community MSP of the Year, with Mr Sarwar having set up a cross party group at Holyrood as part of this work.Meanwhile, Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser was given the Politics in Business Award, and Ms Sturgeon was awarded the E-Politician of the Year for her effective use of Twitter, and Dundee City Council leader John Alexander was named Scottish Local Politician of the Year."

Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work (click here if you want to see the full list).The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973.A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. The Leave side won (by nearly 52% to 48%) but the exit didn't happen straight away - it's going to happen on 29 March 2019.The vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries.The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves the EU - not what will happen after it leaves. This deal is known as the withdrawal agreement.The UK and the EU have come up with this withdrawal agreement about how the UK leaves the EU - although it is currently a draft.It covers some of these key points:A length of time, called the transition period, has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to make a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020.Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term.This is the political declaration. However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for the future talks.Leaders of the other 27 EU countries have gathered for a meeting in Brussels and signed off the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future EU-UK relations.The formal signing-off process took about half an hour.UK Prime Minister Theresa May now needs to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it. A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.Well, at the moment it looks like it... might not.  Mrs May doesn't have enough support from her own Conservative MPs or MPs from other parties.There are a broad range of complaints, many of of which are about the deal failing to give the UK control back from the EU. It's not very clear. The default position in this case would be for the UK to leave without a deal. But MPs would have up to 21 days to suggest a way forward. It is written into law that the UK will be leaving on that date at 11pm UK time.But if there is no deal, or Parliament rejects the deal, it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.The deadline of 29 March 2019 could be extended - but all 28 EU members would have to agree. Other possibilities (explained here in more detail) include the prime minister being allowed to have a second go at getting her deal accepted by Parliament.Or one other suggestion is a fresh referendum, possibly asking voters whether they approve of the deal, rather than re-running the original vote. ""No deal"" means the UK would have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement.That would mean there would be no transition period after Brexit and the UK would cut all ties with the EU overnight.The government has started planning for this potential situation. It has published a series of guides - which cover everything from pet passports to the impact on electricity supplies. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal.But other MPs have played down the warnings of chaos and want a ""clean break"" from the EU.Northern Ireland has featured heavily in discussions about Brexit. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a physical border - with guard posts and checks - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why).But trying to find a way to avoid this if the UK leaves the EU without agreeing a trade deal has proved problematic.So they've agreed to put in place a backstop - that's a sort of safety net to make sure a hard border never happens.It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is meant to be a last resort - the prime minister insists that if all goes as planned it will never be used.

2018-11-24,Five scenarios,https://web.archive.org//web/20181124204510/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. Soon, perhaps in the second week of December, the House of Commons will debate and then vote upon a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion. This week, the new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons ""will stop no deal"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be"". And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was ""no majority for any route forward"". Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out. Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference? More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament. Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.The Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But perhaps there will be a general election instead? That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act and both involve motions of confidence in the Commons. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem."" That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period (and Number 10 has ruled that out) the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight. The clock won't wait. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  "

""We lose Britain, and we keep Italy: it's grotesque"", one former minister commented ruefully to me.That barbed remark lays bare a real anxiety among Germans, that somehow the European Union's centre of gravity will shift once the UK has gone, that a delicate balance will be upset, and it will not be in Berlin's favour.Identifying Italy hints at one source of concern, that the southern Europeans will want to carry in their free spending way. What was for a long time the subtext of European debates, that Germany can be expected to subsidise the others because of war guilt as well as the strength of its economy, became increasingly overt during the Greek debt crisis. Now Italy, with far larger debts, is on a budgetary collision course with the EU.There is though another aspect to the comments one hears these days about how the post-Brexit EU might function, and it hints at a deeper and more emotive schism. If a generation of German politicians has hailed the European project as a triumph for peace this was at least in part because it has provided a way of converting long rivalry with France from the cause of 20th Century wars to the 'engine' of the Continent's economic success. Now though one hears disparagement of France and its president Emanuel Macron from different political quarters. A senior German journalist, commenting on the prominence given to Angela Merkel's meetings with President Macron to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice, said to me, anger in her voice, ""you see? This is our future, this will have to be our future partner, because you are leaving"".Meeting Alexander Gauland, leader of the right wing Alternative for Germany party in his spectacular office overlooking the Reichstag, he too cannot hold back on the subject on France.  ""The British are the only believers in free trade,"" he told us in a Newsnight interview, ""the French are bureaucratic in a way we don't like in our party"".Of course there are still pro-French voices in German politics, including those who feel that Chancellor Merkel has missed a real opportunity to build the Eurozone by spurning Mr Macron's proposals for further financial integration. But in my recent contacts at least, I have noticed rather more members of the German establishment who reject what the president stands for, suspecting another attempt to get Germany to finance French public spending and worrying about the destabilizing effect of Brexit.""For decades there has been a delicate triangle of power running Europe,"" the former minister quoted earlier says, ""and with Berlin, Paris, and London each playing their own distinctive role"". His concern is that removing the UK, with its big contributions to European security and financial prudence will lead to bigger problems for the EU. Germany, even during the long Merkel years, has been diffident about playing the leadership role in Europe. It is comfortable with tactical interventions on monetary or political matters, much less so in flexing diplomatic or military muscle. The prospect of Brexit has brought the realization that France may now try to fill this vacuum. While many German politicians are uneasy about the idea of leading Europe, it seems that the idea of letting President Macron (who one person I was talking to this week in Berlin called, ""a charlatan"") play that role by default disturbs them. Indeed it may rankle so much that it causes Germany to abandon its post Second World War reluctance to exert its power in Europe.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates.Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father, is a former Conservative MEP and founder of Environmentalists for Europe, who believes the UK would be better off remaining in the EU.Ella Whelan, author and journalist at Spiked, staunchly believes in Brexit.They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting.But did they get on?How would you describe yourself? Barely blonde public-school boy. What are your views on Brexit? In the run-up to Brexit, I was very much for Remain. However, when Britain voted, I said, ""OK, we're going to leave."" But I am absolutely not in favour of Brexit along the terms the government is discussing. What was your initial impression? A real pleasure to meet her and obviously a first-class brain there. I found it hard to keep up, actually.How was your date? Lively stuff - it did me a lot of good to be exposed to someone who was deeply committed to the Brexit deal.What was the best thing about the date? The sausages were very good. What was the worst thing? Possibly being forced to concentrate for about two hours.What did you talk about? I argued that during my time in the EU, it was in a way quite exciting to be able to use the EU mechanisms to drive through projects and programmes and political decisions which it might have been harder to get through if you just worked at a national level, country by country.What was her most convincing argument? She did convince me that there are a lot of people out there who take Brexit very seriously indeed - it's not just a political football to be kicked around. Even if it did come to a second vote... I don't think that the Remainers would necessarily find it any easier to win the argument than they did last time round. Did you convince her on anything? Well I very much doubt that. That would be a first. I don't think I've ever convinced anyone about anything.Would you see her again? Absolutely, with great pleasure.Describe her in three words: Intelligent, articulate, attractive. Marks out of 10 for the date: Sounds a bit like Strictly Come Dancing - I'd give it an eight or a nine because I was intrigued and absorbed and actually fairly challenged by our discussion.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.What was your initial impression? A very, very, charming man - I was a little intimidated as he has been an MEP and is very knowledgeable in relation to the EU but we got on very well. How was your date? It went well, we agreed more than I thought we would, which was a nice surprise because it meant that we could actually talk about some of the finer points rather than going at each other's throats.What was the best thing about the date? Being taken out by a gentleman was a very nice thing to do. What was the worst thing? That we didn't get to finish the dinners because we were talking about Brexit too much. What did you talk about? We talked about the Irish border a lot, which I think is one of the most interesting things for me about looking at what's gone wrong with the Brexit discussion.Any common ground? We both agreed that what has happened to Brexit is a terrible sham.What was your biggest disagreement? We really disagreed on immigration and not how you'd think because I'm very pro-immigration and Stanley is quite anti it because he is very concerned about population growth. In another discussion, about immigration, we may not have got along as well as we did.Did he convince you on anything? No, but that's not because he wasn't thoughtful but because I think that this debate is the centre of my political outlook, so it would take more than an earthquake to change my mind on this. Would you see him again? We come from totally different backgrounds but sometimes once in a while that works. And he's a gentleman, so yes, why not?Describe him in three words: Charming, ardent and patient. Marks out of 10 for the date: Nine, because the conversation was very interesting but we didn't get to finish our dinner.

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

After 20 months of negotiations, the 27 leaders gave the deal their blessing after less than an hour's discussion.They said the deal - which needs to be approved by the UK Parliament - paved the way for an ""orderly withdrawal"".Theresa May said the deal ""delivered for the British people"" and set the UK ""on course for a prosperous future"".Speaking in Brussels, she urged both Leave and Remain voters to unite behind the agreement, insisting the British public ""do not want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit"". The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The EU officially endorsed the terms of the UK's withdrawal during a short meeting, bringing to an end negotiations which began in March 2017. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said anyone in Britain who thought the bloc might offer improved terms if MPs rejected the deal would be ""disappointed"". But European Council President Donald Tusk, who broke the news of the agreement on Twitter, said he would not speculate on what would happen in such a situation, saying: ""I am not a fortune teller.""The UK Parliament is expected to vote on the deal on 12 December, but its approval is far from guaranteed. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Conservatives MPs are set to vote against.Mrs May has appealed to the public to get behind the agreement - saying that although it involved compromises, it was a ""good deal that unlocks a bright future for the UK"". At a news conference in Brussels, she said the agreement would:The agreement, she added, would not remove Gibraltar from the ""UK family"" - a reference to a last-minute wrangle with Spain over the territory.The EU leaders have approved the two key Brexit documents:There was no formal vote on Sunday, with the EU proceeding by consensus.Mr Juncker said it was a ""sad day"" and no-one should be ""raising champagne glasses"" at the prospect of the UK leaving.While it was not his place to tell MPs how to vote, he said they should bear in mind that ""this is the best deal possible...this is the only deal possible"".His message was echoed by Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar who said ""any other deal really only exists in people's imagination"".But Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite suggested there were a number of possible outcomes if the UK Parliament rejected the deal, including an extension of the negotiations, or another referendum. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorIt's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests.And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime.Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead.But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is.No member states raised objections to the Brexit withdrawal deal and it was approved in a matter of seconds, according to a senior EU official. Around seven leaders spoke in the session of the 27 member states, mostly to say this was a sad day and they wanted the future relationship with the UK to be as close as possible.After Mrs May's address, roughly half of the leaders spoke. Several wished her good luck with the meaningful vote in Parliament. No ""what ifs"" were discussed.Mrs May will now need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it.She is expected to spend the next fortnight travelling the country trying to sell the deal before a parliamentary vote in the second week of December. If MPs reject the deal, a number of things could happen - including leaving with no deal, an attempt to renegotiate or a general election.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the parliamentary arithmetic was ""looking challenging"" and warned ""nothing could be ruled out"" if Mrs May lost the vote, including the government collapsing. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr that the UK was getting ""between 70% and 80%"" of what it wanted, while the agreement ""mitigated"" most of the negative economic impacts.Asked if the UK would be better off than if it stayed in, he said the country would not be ""significantly worse or better off but it does mean we get our independence back"".The agreement will also have to go back to the European Council, where a majority of countries (20 out of 27 states) will need to vote for it.It will also need to be ratified by the European Parliament, in a vote expected to take place in early 2019.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responded to Sunday's summit by calling the deal ""the worst of all worlds"".He said his party would oppose it, but would work with others ""to block a no deal outcome"" and ensure ""a sensible deal"" was on the table.Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said he would find it ""very, very difficult"" to support the agreement as it stood.""I don't believe that, so far, this deal delivers on what the British people really voted for,"" he told Sky's Sophy Ridge show. ""I think it has ceded too much control.""SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - who wanted to stay in the EU - said it was a ""bad deal"" and Parliament should consider ""better alternatives"", such as remaining in the single market and customs union permanently. And Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster - who wants to leave the EU - said her party's parliamentary pact with the Conservatives would be reviewed if MPs approved the deal.She told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the agreement as it stood would leave Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK ""still within European structures with no say in its rules"".Former PM Tony Blair, who backs another referendum, said the deal was ""a dodo"".

After nearly two years of negotiations, arguments - and the inevitable moments where it felt like the process would explode - there is, now, a deal.It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. With the explicit backing from almost every European leader who has opened their mouth today, this is the ""only deal"", the ""best possible deal"", ""the max"" .The message to MPs from Theresa May and her counterparts: don't kid yourselves if you think something else might magically appear if you vote it down. And the message to the public? Just let me get on with it, then we can all stop talking about Brexit - please.Again today she used the platform to ""talk directly to the British public"", to explain how her (now rather pink) red lines, on ""money, laws and borders"", have been followed.It's her Brexit with caveats, with a lot to be sorted out about the future, in the future. You can remind yourself what's actually in the deal here.And Number 10 is all too aware that dozens and dozens of their own MPs hate it. Theresa May has reached her imperfect compromise at a moment when in Parliament both sides are hardening against the idea of compromising at all.For two years Theresa May has survived by tacking one way, then another. But now the deal is on paper, in black and white, that approach can't go on. A senior government figure said privately that Number 10 was past the point of trying to please everyone. And of course, everyone in government is all too aware that it is likely that the deal will be rejected by Parliament in any case.But the only potential route through for the prime minister is through the middle, to look like, as one senior Whitehall official describes it, ""the adult in a world of children"".However the prime minister looks, however she sounds in the next fortnight, the levels of unhappiness at home are so profound that her pleas may fall on deaf ears. If the deal falls, she, and her government may fall with it. Scrape it through then she'll have pulled off a feat far harder than getting the actual deal done. PS: Here's a great explanation from my colleague Ben Wright about what might happen if the vote, which we expect on 12 December, doesn't pass the deal."
2018-11-25,Analysis: Macron's blunt fishing warning to UK,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46336962,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowEU leaders who gathered in Brussels put on a united front to back Theresa May's argument that the withdrawal agreement they endorsed was the ""best and only"" Brexit deal available.But there was no sense of celebration, and there were plenty of signs of how tough negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship are likely to be. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, and the political declaration on future ties, the remaining 27 EU leaders published a separate statement (without the UK) that vowed to protect their own interests, on a range of issues from fishing to fair competition to the rights of citizens. ""The European Council,"" it said, ""will demonstrate particular vigilance as regards safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens, the necessity to maintain ambitious level playing field conditions, and to protect fishing enterprises and coastal communities.""It emphasised in particular that a fisheries agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"" is a matter of priority. The statement was a clear sign that the UK will not have things all its own way, when it comes to balancing the competing demands of access to EU markets for UK fish produce, and access to UK fishing waters for EU boats. Several EU leaders highlighted fishing as a particularly sensitive issue. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said talks on fisheries were ""undoubtedly going to be an area where negotiations are going to be tough"".But the bluntest warning came from the French President Emmanuel Macron, who suggested that if the UK was unwilling to compromise in negotiations on fishing, which would need to make rapid progress, then talks on a wider trade deal would be slow.""We as 27 have a clear position on fair competition, on fish, and on the subject of the EU's regulatory autonomy, and that forms part of our position for the future relationship talks,"" he said.The president implied that without sufficient progress on trade, the backstop plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland would have to be implemented, including a temporary customs union for the whole of the UK. ""It is a lever because it is in our mutual interest to have this future relationship,"" Mr Macron said.""I can't imagine that the desire of Theresa May or her supporters is to remain for the long term in a customs union, but (instead) to define a proper future relationship that resolves this problem.""It is a warning that the prime minister could have done without, as she seeks to appeal to the British public for support for her deal in advance of a vote in Parliament next month. But it is also a reminder - if any were needed - that other countries have domestic political concerns that will have to be taken into account. If anything, the negotiations on the future relationship - which can only begin formally after the UK has left the EU - will be even harder than the 18 months of negotiations that produced the withdrawal agreement which has just been endorsed.

2018-11-25,EU leaders still hope for fishing access,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46328763,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNicola Sturgeon has warned of broken promises over fishing as EU leaders agreed to Theresa May's Brexit deal.A document published by the remaining 27 EU countries made clear they hoped to negotiate access to UK waters based on existing rights.Ms Sturgeon said that could not be squared with promises made to the UK fishing industry. Theresa May has said her deal would take the UK out of the controversial Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).The prime minister and EU27 leaders approved the Brexit deal on Sunday after less than an hour's discussion at a meeting in Brussels.But a document published online made clear the remaining EU members were still seeking to negotiate continued access to UK fishing grounds during the two-year transition period. The document said a fishing deal was a priority and ""should build on, inter alia, existing reciprocal access and quota shares"".Scottish Secretary David Mundell has previously said he could not support any extension of CFP rules beyond 2020.Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""I'll be interested to hear David Mundell explain how this - 'existing reciprocal access and quota shares' - can be squared with the promises made to the Scottish fishing industry. (Hint - it can't).""I’ll be interested to hear David Mundell explain how this - ‘existing reciprocal access and quota shares’ - can be squared with the promises made to the Scottish fishing industry. (Hint - it can’t). https://t.co/9sO8TBsLVhEnd of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonThe Brexit deal has implications for the debate over Scottish independence and the future of fishing.The withdrawal agreement does not let Scottish Conservatives off the hook over the fishing industry.All 13 Scottish Tory MPs demanded exit from the common fisheries policy by 2020 and insisted ""access and quota shares cannot be included"" in the future economic partnership.Both the UK and EU say they'll use ""best endeavours"" to conclude a new fisheries agreement by 2020 but the EU has certainly not given up on keeping its current share of the UK catch.A statement agreed by the EU27 makes clear they will prioritise an agreement that builds on ""existing reciprocal access and quota shares"".In short, the fight over fishing is deferred.Read Glenn's analysis in fullMr Mundell later responded, saying any future deal on fishing had still to be agreed, and that the prime minister had made clear she would defend the UK's fishing interests robustly. He tweeted: ""The Prime Minister made clear earlier today, the UK will be an independent coastal state once again, in full sovereign control of our waters, able to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in them, with that access not tied to any other aspect of our economic partnership.""Nicola Sturgeon has also criticised Theresa May's appeal to the public to get behind the Brexit deal. In a letter to the nation Mrs May has said leaving the EU next year would be ""a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country"".The 800-word message said the UK would ""take back control"" of laws and money which, it suggested, could be spent on the NHS.""But Ms Sturgeon said that ""almost nothing in this desperate letter is true"".She said the UK Parliament should consider ""better alternatives"", such as remaining in the single market and customs union permanently - and she urged MPs to reject it. In Brussels, French president Emmanuel Macron stressed the importance his country placed on fishing in future talks. He said ""all of our fishermen will be protected"", with the French planning to ""defend access as part of the indispensable balance"".The Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson, the only Scottish Tory who has so far said he will vote against the Brexit deal in the House of Commons, said the EU27 document was ""troubling"". He told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland: ""The arrangement that we have on fisheries has been devastating to fishing communities across Scotland and across the whole of the UK.""It's in the interest of the EU to keep it going and they want to build on those existing arrangements, so to my mind that can only mean the continuation of some form of common fisheries policy.

Shadow Scottish Secretary  Lesley Laird wrote: ""I do not need to tell you that this is a clear breach of your red line on fishing.""I would therefore be grateful if you were able to clarify that you will not be voting for the deal on this basis.""If that is the case, I really must ask why you have not resigned your position in the Cabinet?"""
2018-11-25,Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46335118,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe withdrawal agreement approved by the UK and EU leaders is ""worse than no deal"", DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has said.The DUP, which props up the government, has repeatedly said it will vote against it in Parliament.There has been political opposition to the plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border.But Sinn Féin, which campaigned against Brexit, has described the deal as ""the least worst option"" on the table.A number of business and farming groups in NI have also urged the DUP to support the deal and provide certainty.Speaking to BBC 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr Dodds said his party's ""one red line"" had been ignored by the government.The agreement on the backstop would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules, if it took effect.The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea.""What Theresa may has succeeded in doing is putting a proposition on the table which is worse than no deal and worse than staying in the EU, whatever else is put on the table,"" said the North Belfast MP.""The government is going to spend the next fortnight engaged in all sorts of project fear initiatives in order to try to get MPs to vote for something that is clearly unsatisfactory.""The DUP has repeatedly said it will vote against the deal, as it stands, when it comes to Parliament to be ratified in a few weeks' time.Mr Dodds said his party would not be ""bought off"", he said, adding that ""there is absolutely no way this deal can go through on the basis of side offers.""""The DUP has been very clear all along - we have core beliefs and principles and we're sticking by those,"" he said.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald said backed the withdrawal deal, but said: ""The agreement endorsed today between the EU27 and the British government does not resolve Brexit. ""It is the least worst option - there is no good Brexit.""""It must be clear that under no scenario will there be a hardening of the border in Ireland or the abandonment of the Good Friday Agreement, which we must all work to fully implement and defend,"" she added.Earlier, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party is ""disappointed"" with Theresa May and the government's decision to press ahead with the Brexit deal.Mrs Foster said the the agreement ""goes against everything"" the DUP had been promised.Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Arlene Foster said: ""We're disappointed with the way this has progressed.""She (Theresa May) is a unionist, but this deal goes against everything she has said about all of that.""Mrs Foster said there is still time to negotiate for a ""better deal"".""We should use the time now to look for a third way. I recognise we are negotiating with a fatigue, there comes a time when everybody is tired and just wants to get on with it but we shouldn't accept the outcome for the sake of it,"" she added.Several newspapers have reported that the DUP is involved in discussions with several cabinet ministers about a secret ""Brexit plan B"", if Mrs May's deal does not get passed in the Commons.Mrs Foster did not explicitly deny the report, but said her party was having ""conversations right across government"" about the deal.She also said she did not see any circumstances right now where Mrs May's deal would have enough support to get through parliament.The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament.It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure.Mrs Foster has already said if the government's deal gets passed in the Commons, the DUP will have to review the confidence and supply pact.""We'll review it at that point in time: things are fluid, things change - we'll have to see where we are,"" she added.The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario."

Here is the full letter.""When I became your prime minister, the United Kingdom had just voted to leave the European Union.""From my first day in the job, I knew I had a clear mission before me - a duty to fulfil on your behalf: to honour the result of the referendum and secure a brighter future for our country by negotiating a good Brexit deal with the EU.""Throughout the long and complex negotiations that have taken place over the last year and a half, I have never lost sight of that duty.""Today, I am in Brussels with the firm intention of agreeing a Brexit deal with the leaders of the other 27 EU nations.""It will be a deal that is in our national interest - one that works for our whole country and all of our people, whether you voted 'Leave' or 'Remain'.""It will honour the result of the referendum.""We will take back control of our borders, by putting an end to the free movement of people once and for all.""Instead of an immigration system based on where a person comes from, we will build one based on the skills and talents a person has to offer.""We will take back control of our money, by putting an end to vast annual payments to the EU.""Instead, we will be able to spend British taxpayers' money on our own priorities, like the extra £394 million per week that we are investing in our long-term plan for the NHS.""And we will take back control of our laws, by ending the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK.""In future, our laws will be made, interpreted and enforced by our own courts and legislatures.""We will be out of EU programmes that do not work in our interests: out of the Common Agricultural Policy that has failed our farmers, and out of the Common Fisheries Policy that has failed our coastal communities.""Instead, we will be able to design a system of agricultural support that works for us, and we will be an independent coastal state once again, with full control over our waters.""The deal also protects the things we value.""EU citizens who have built their lives in the United Kingdom will have their rights protected, as will UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU.""A free trade area will allow goods to flow easily across our borders, protecting the many skilled jobs right across the country that rely on integrated supply-chains.""Because our European friends will always be our allies in the fight against terrorism and organised crime, the deal will ensure that security co-operation will continue, so we can keep our people safe.""As prime minister of the United Kingdom, I have from day one been determined to deliver a Brexit deal that works for every part of our country - for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, for our Overseas Territories like Gibraltar, and also for the Crown Dependencies.""This deal will do that. ""Crucially, it will protect the integrity of our United Kingdom and ensure that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland - so people can live their lives as they do now.""It is a deal for a brighter future, which enables us to seize the opportunities that lie ahead.""Outside the EU, we will be able to sign new trade deals with other countries and open up new markets in the fastest-growing economies around the world.""With Brexit settled, we will be able to focus our energies on the many other important issues facing us here at home: keeping our economy strong, and making sure every community shares in prosperity; securing our NHS for the future, giving every child a great start in life, and building the homes that families need; tackling the burning injustices that hold too many people back, and building a country for the future that truly works for everyone.""On 29 March next year, the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.""We will then begin a new chapter in our national life. I want that to be a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country.""It must mark the point when we put aside the labels of 'Leave' and 'Remain' for good and we come together again as one people.""To do that, we need to get on with Brexit now by getting behind this deal.""Parliament will have the chance to do that in a few weeks' time when it has a meaningful vote on the deal I hope to strike today.""I will be campaigning with my heart and soul to win that vote and to deliver this Brexit deal, for the good of our United Kingdom and all of our people."""
2018-11-25,'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal',https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-46334228,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWales will be less prosperous under Theresa May's draft Brexit deal, according to the first minister.Carwyn Jones said Wales received £600m a year from the EU and exported 60% of its goods to Europe.He said it was important there were no ""barriers put up between the market that we sell most of our goods in"".The prime minister has written an open letter saying her Brexit deal promised a ""brighter future"" for Britain as the EU signed it off on Sunday.Mrs May has been in Brussels for the most important step so far in the UK's exit from the European Union. The 27 other EU leaders approved the withdrawal agreement and a political declaration on future relations following talks.Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales the draft deal was ""better than no deal but certainly short of what I would have expected"".Asked if he thought Wales would be less prosperous after Brexit, Mr Jones said: ""Oh yes, there is no question in my mind but this is better than no deal.""Welsh projects supported by European Union funds:Mr Jones added: ""What we want to do is to make sure the European market, which is our biggest market, 60% of exports go there, 90% of our food and drink exports go there, that we don't see new barriers put up between the market that we sell most of our goods in.""That seems to me to be one of the daftest things that we could do.""He said Wales received £600m a year in EU funding and he was promised the nation ""wouldn't lose out a penny"".""People say we should not be dependent on it but, the reality is...we haven't got that money,"" he said.The UK Parliament must also approve the deal agreed by the EU leaders and MPs are expected to vote in December.Mr Jones went on to say it could be ""really difficult to see how the prime minister can get this deal through Parliament"".And he said there were ""different opinions"" within his own Labour party on moving forward, with some, like him, thinking a general election was needed, some calling for a second referendum and a ""small minority"" in favour of Brexit.Mrs May said leaving the EU next year would be ""a moment of renewal and reconciliation for our whole country"".After 18 months of negotiations, it only took the EU's 27 leaders less than an hour to sign off on the Brexit deal.First Minister Carwyn Jones would like to see a different deal that leads to a much closer relationship between the UK and the EU as he backs continued membership of the single market and customs union.But the important point to remember here is that what kind of trading relationship we have in the future is still up for discussion.Part one of the Brexit talks in Brussels is over but part two - discussion on the future partnership - doesn't start until after we've officially left on 29 March next year.Much can change before then, especially as Theresa May has one final rather precipitous mountain left to climb - getting enough MPs to back her deal in Parliament in the coming weeks.If she fails to do so, then we're looking at a range of possibilities - from a 'no-deal' Brexit to perhaps no Brexit at all.It's done and dusted here in Brussels - all eyes now on Westminster."

MP Damian Collins later told the BBC that he believed the documents were ""highly relevant"" to his inquiry. Facebook has demanded their return.The documents were intercepted when an executive of US tech firm Six4Three was on a trip to London.In a highly unusual move the House of Commons serjeant-at-arms was sent to the businessman's hotel and he was given a final warning and a two-hour deadline to comply with the order.When the executive failed to do so he was escorted to Parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered, the paper said.The firm is involved in court action against Facebook in the US, where the documents were obtained through legal procedures.Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee, said he believes the documents - which include emails - contain information about how Facebook and other parties handle user data.He told the BBC: ""We felt this [information] was highly relevant to the inquiry... and therefore we sent an order to Mr [Ted] Kramer through the serjeant-at-arms asking that these documents be supplied to us. Ultimately, that order was complied with.""Mr Collins said he had reviewed the documents, and his committee would discuss this week how it intends to proceed. In the Observer, Mr Collins said the methods used to obtain the documents were unprecedented, adding: ""But it's an unprecedented situation.""He criticised Facebook's lack of cooperation with his committee, and said the ""documents contained answers to some of the questions we have been seeking about the use of data, especially by external developers"".Facebook had yet to respond to a BBC request for comment, but told the Observer: ""The materials obtained by the DCMS committee are subject to a protective order of the San Mateo Superior Court restricting their disclosure.""We have asked the DCMS committee to refrain from reviewing them and to return them to counsel or to Facebook. We have no further comment.""Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg have faced intense pressure over the social media giant's use of personal data, the spread of fake news, and, this month, allegations that it hired a PR firm to make claims about the financier George Soros.Last month the UK data watchdog fined Facebook £500,000 following its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica affair. Facebook has appealed against the fine, claiming that the watchdog found no evidence that UK users' personal data had been shared inappropriately and the penalty was therefore unjustified.The Cambridge Analytica scandal stems from the discovery that an academic at the University of Cambridge - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - used a personality quiz to harvest up to 87 million Facebook users' details.Some of this was subsequently shared with the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which used it to target political advertising in the US.It was initially reported that about 1.1 million UK-based users had had their details exposed."

There has been political opposition among unionists to the government's plan because of the backstop, which aims to avoid a hard Irish border.It would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules if it took effect.European Council President Donald Tusk has recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal at a summit on Sunday.The DUP is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union and place a trade border down the Irish Sea.Mr Johnson is one of two senior Conservative MPs to appear at the conference this weekend, after Chancellor Philip Hammond spoke on Friday night.""We must agree that neither side will introduce a hard border in Northern Ireland,"" he said.The former foreign secretary said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and that there is still time to work for a better deal.""In the words of that great Northern Irish singer Van Morrison, it is time we all moved from the dark end of the street to the bright side of the road,"" he added, to applause. He said he hoped the DUP and Conservatives could continue working together, ""backing our union against all those who would seek to divide us"".by Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporterWhat do Star Wars, sardines and the Titanic all have in common?Answer: They all somehow ended up getting a mention in Boris Johnson's speech at the DUP conference (yes, really).It certainly wasn't a normal party conference, but these are unusual times. There was standing room only as the politician, who often brings a rock star flavour to events, took to the stage.That being said, while much of what he said received roars of applause, my colleague Gareth Gordon noticed one woman asleep in the front row.But even getting Mr Johnson to appear at the conference will be seen as a victory for the DUP, in its attempt to resist the government's path for Brexit. Before party leader Arlene Foster was announced to the stage, one DUP councillor described her as ""a lady who's not for turning"".But with Theresa May also holding firm against the DUP's opposition to the backstop so far, soon enough someone's going to have to give.Mr Johnson also suggested the creation of a secretary of state for ""no deal"" on World Trade Organisation terms, ""with real powers across Whitehall to make things happen"". ""I do not believe that we will exit without a deal - that is totally unnecessary - but it is only responsible of government to make the proper preparations,"" he added.Mrs Foster told her party's conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used.The government has said it is looking at alternative arrangements to ensure the backstop is a last resort.But, Mrs Foster said there were ""many contradictions"" in the draft withdrawal agreement.She said she understood the position of many in the business community, who have urged DUP MPs to back the deal.But she added that the party could not wish away proposals that it believes are not in the best interests of Northern Ireland's economy or interests.""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say,"" she said.Ahead of the party conference, Mrs Foster warned that if the deal gets passed in parliament, her party may have to revisit its confidence-and-supply pact with the Conservatives.The DUP holds the balance of power at Westminster, as the government relies on the votes of its 10 MPs to have a working majority in parliament.It signed a confidence and supply pact with the Conservatives in June 2017 and negotiated an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland - but the rift between the parties over the Brexit plan has put the arrangement under significant pressure.On Saturday, she said ""the DUP had never been afraid to say yes when it is right to do so, nor to say no when required"".Earlier, the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the party would ""stand firm in the face of inevitable onslaught"" in opposing the government's Brexit plan.Mr Dodds told the party's conference: ""Prime minister - bin the backstop.""Mr Dodds told the conference that the union is ""non-negotiable"".He described Theresa May's draft plan as portraying a ""pitiful and pathetic place for the United Kingdom"".The government has insisted that it will not renegotiate the current plan, and has urged MPs to back it or risk a no deal scenario.Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to leave the EU with a deal, but ""not a deal at any price"".On Friday, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.The government of Gibraltar is also represented at the DUP conference. Gibraltar has become involved in the Brexit debate as Spain sought written assurances from the UK that it would be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory.Donald Tusk recommended that the EU approve the Brexit deal after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez received assurances from the UK government over Gibraltar, and dropped his threat to boycott the summit.On Saturday, the government of Gibraltar said the territory ""will not fold"" over Brexit and staunchly supports the union.Housing and equality minister Samantha Sacramento told the DUP conference Gibraltar would ""not be bullied"".The chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, was due to attend but could not make it because of the ongoing Brexit negotiations.Gibraltar voted overwhelmingly (96%) to remain in the EU."

UK Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived in Brussels and held talks with top EU officials, ahead of the summit.Meanwhile, former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would become a ""satellite state"" under the deal. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The terms of the UK's withdrawal have been under negotiation since June 2016 following a referendum in which 51.9% voted to leave the EU.Even if the EU approves the deal, it still has to be passed by the UK Parliament, with many MPs having stated their opposition.Spain had raised last-minute objections ahead of the summit about how the issue of Gibraltar had been handled in the Brexit talks so far.But EU leaders secured a compromise with the Spanish prime minister, who said that Europe and the UK ""had accepted the conditions set down by Spain"" and so would ""vote in favour of Brexit"".Mr Tusk, who represents EU leaders on the world stage, said he recommended ""that we approve on Sunday the outcome of the Brexit negotiations"" in a letter to members of the European Council.He added: ""No-one has reasons to be happy. But at least at this critical time, the EU 27 has passed the test of unity and solidarity."" Mrs May met the president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, and Mr Tusk for talks on Saturday evening.Then on Sunday, EU leaders will meet for the special Brexit summit. They will be asked to approve two key Brexit documents:There is no formal vote on Sunday but the EU expects to proceed after reaching a consensus.If the EU signs off the withdrawal deal, Mrs May will then need to persuade MPs in the UK Parliament to back it.A vote is expected in December. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and the DUP have all said they will vote against the government's deal, as well as many Conservatives.BBC News political correspondent Ben Wright has said Mrs May ""faces an incredibly hard job"" getting the deal passed by MPs.Spain threatened to derail the Brexit deal over concerns about its role in future trade arrangements involving Gibraltar - a British Overseas Territory with 30,000 residents.But the UK published a letter it had sent to Spain reassuring it over the withdrawal agreement.After holding emergency talks with Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, the Spanish prime minister dropped his threat. Mr Sanchez said: ""Gibraltar is excluded from the general negotiation of the European Union with the United Kingdom. ""This gives the chance to Spain to have direct negotiations with the United Kingdom over Gibraltar."" Spain's foreign minister Josep Borrell said the assurance was ""the most important"" development since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which ceded Gibraltar to Britain.But BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said that the UK's letter does not contain anything substantially different from the withdrawal agreement.He said there was a suspicion that Spanish ministers were ""showboating a little for the domestic electorate"" on the eve of elections in Andalusia, in the south of Spain, where Gibraltar is a significant issue.Theresa May said discussions with Spain have been ""constructive and sensible"" but that the UK's position on Gibraltar will not change.She said: ""I'm proud that Gibraltar is British and I will always stand by Gibraltar.""Gibraltar's chief minister Fabian Picardo also played down Spain's claims about the UK's guarantees.He said: ""What you have heard from the Spanish prime minister was not a reflection of any new position, however much he tried to present it as such.""The former foreign secretary told Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) conference that the UK was on the verge of ""making a historic mistake"".Mr Johnson said the UK had an ""absolute duty to get this right"" and there was still time to work for a better deal.Mrs May relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons.The DUP has threatened to look again at the agreement with the Conservatives if the Brexit deal gets through Parliament.But Mr Johnson said it was ""absolutely vital that we keep this partnership going"" to avoid Labour coming to power.The DUP opposes the Brexit deal because of the ""backstop"" - the back-up plan to make sure a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland never happens.It will only come into effect if the UK and EU fail to agree a long-term trade deal. But the backstop would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.Please upgrade your browserDUP leader Arlene Foster told her party conference that the prime minister had not been able to guarantee that the backstop would not have to be used.She urged the government to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland, adding: ""The choice is not between this deal and no deal, despite what the government spin machine may say.""Chancellor Philip Hammond insisted that the prime minister's Brexit deal is better than remaining in the EU.He said the deal respected the result of the 2016 referendum and offered ""the best compromise possible"".He added that he was hopeful of a solution with the DUP.On Friday, the PM said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement.But Mrs May declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"".

Sir John - a Eurosceptic - has told the Sun that the honour has no bearing on how he will vote on the deal.Speaking to his local newspaper, Spalding Today, Sir John said he was ""immensely proud"" to receive the knighthood.""I am very proud to be MP for the area in which I live - I see it as something for everyone in the area, not just for me,"" he said.Congratulations Sir John and Lady Susan on John’s well deserved  knighthood. Thank you Sir John Hayes CBE MP for the work you do for the residents of the constituencyEnd of Twitter post  by @M_WConservativeThe awarding of a knighthood to an MP outside of the usual New Year's and Queen's birthday honours lists is not unprecedented.Conservative ex-defence minister Mike Penning and ex-whip Robert Syms lost their roles in the post-election reshuffle in 2017 and were given knighthoods months later.Former cabinet minister Eric Pickles, who was a casualty of David Cameron's reshuffle following the Tories' 2015 general election victory, received his knighthood later that year.Sir John served in a series of ministerial roles from 2010 to January 2018 and was Home Office security minister from May 2015 to June 2016, while Mrs May was home secretary.The Queen has also approved the appointment of Tory deputy chief whip Christopher Pincher and Labour whip Mark Tami to the Privy Council, Downing Street said.On Twitter, Labour MP Chris Bryant congratulated Mr Tami and Sir John, paying tribute to the latter's campaigning on acquired brain injury.Many congratulations to @MarkTamiMPAnd a doughty campaigner on Acquired Brain Injury, Sir John Hayes.https://t.co/2o2RP3Ie7JEnd of Twitter post  by @RhonddaBryantMr Bryant and Sir John - who himself is a survivor of brain injury - jointly called a Commons debate on the condition earlier this year."

She was speaking on Radio Ulster's Inside Politics programme.The DUP is holding its annual conference this weekend.""If this is not going to deliver on Brexit then of course that brings us to the situation of looking again at the confidence and supply deal. ""But we are not there yet,"" she said.The DUP leader insisted the government should ""ditch the Irish backstop"" and recognise that, in practice, nobody will implement a hard border on the island of Ireland. She argued that the prospect of such a hard border has taken on a ""mythical status"" in the Brexit negotiations.Mrs Foster argued that the EU Withdrawal Agreement as it stands will not get the support of parliament. Instead of ""wasting time"" on the agreement, she said Mrs May should try to secure a better deal. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is one of two Conservative MPs to attend the DUP party conference in Belfast this weekend.Mr Hammond spoke at a dinner on Friday night.Earlier, he told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop.He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down.Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the ""parliamentary process"", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop.""I would much prefer to see us extending the implementation period and I am sure my DUP colleagues would take the same view,"" he said.""So we need to look at how we can provide reassurance about how we will use the options that the agreement gives us.""Boris Johnson will give a speech to the conference on Saturday afternoon.Mrs Foster said the reference to the potential use of technology to monitor cross-border trade in the latest EU-UK Political Declaration does not change her party's objections to Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement. She said it would have been much better if both the EU and the UK had explored potential technological solutions to maintaining smooth cross-border trade in the summer of last year, when unionists previously championed the idea. Mrs  Foster said the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding and have the status of an international treaty, so it remains important to the DUP that nothing contained in it damages the UK constitutionally or economically.Inside Politics is on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday at 18:05 GMT and Saturday at 13:35 GMT."

2018-11-25,Brexit: A really simple guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46318565,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowFeeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU (European Union). The EU is a group of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow anyone to easily move between the countries to live and work (click here if you want to see the full list).The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973.A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. The Leave side won (by nearly 52% to 48%) but the exit didn't happen straight away - it's going to happen on 29 March 2019.The vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries.The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves the EU - not what will happen after it leaves. This deal is known as the withdrawal agreement.The UK and the EU have come up with this withdrawal agreement about how the UK leaves the EU - although it is currently a draft.It covers some of these key points:A length of time, called the transition period, has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to make a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020.Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term.This is the political declaration. However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for the future talks.Leaders of the other 27 EU countries have gathered for a meeting in Brussels and signed off the withdrawal agreement and political declaration on the future EU-UK relations.The formal signing-off process took about half an hour.UK Prime Minister Theresa May now needs to persuade MPs in her own Parliament to back it. A vote in Parliament is expected to happen in December.Well, at the moment it looks like it... might not.  Mrs May doesn't have enough support from her own Conservative MPs or MPs from other parties.There are a broad range of complaints, many of of which are about the deal failing to give the UK control back from the EU. It's not very clear. The default position in this case would be for the UK to leave without a deal. But MPs would have up to 21 days to suggest a way forward. It is written into law that the UK will be leaving on that date at 11pm UK time.But if there is no deal, or Parliament rejects the deal, it is impossible to say with any certainty what will happen next.The deadline of 29 March 2019 could be extended - but all 28 EU members would have to agree. Other possibilities (explained here in more detail) include the prime minister being allowed to have a second go at getting her deal accepted by Parliament.Or one other suggestion is a fresh referendum, possibly asking voters whether they approve of the deal, rather than re-running the original vote. ""No deal"" means the UK would have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement.That would mean there would be no transition period after Brexit and the UK would cut all ties with the EU overnight.The government has started planning for this potential situation. It has published a series of guides - which cover everything from pet passports to the impact on electricity supplies. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says it will be a ""national disaster"" if the UK leaves without a deal.But other MPs have played down the warnings of chaos and want a ""clean break"" from the EU.Northern Ireland has featured heavily in discussions about Brexit. Both the UK and the EU want to avoid a physical border - with guard posts and checks - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (here's why).But trying to find a way to avoid this if the UK leaves the EU without agreeing a trade deal has proved problematic.So they've agreed to put in place a backstop - that's a sort of safety net to make sure a hard border never happens.It would mean that Northern Ireland - but not the rest of the UK - would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is meant to be a last resort - the prime minister insists that if all goes as planned it will never be used.

2018-11-25,Five scenarios,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. Soon, perhaps in the second week of December, the House of Commons will debate and then vote upon a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion. This week, the new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons ""will stop no deal"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be"". And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was ""no majority for any route forward"". Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out. Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference? More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament. Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.The Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But perhaps there will be a general election instead? That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act and both involve motions of confidence in the Commons. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem."" That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period (and Number 10 has ruled that out) the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight. The clock won't wait. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  "
2018-11-25,Post-Brexit Europe,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46302931,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe prospect of Brexit looms large in Berlin these days and people are not happy about it.  ""We lose Britain, and we keep Italy: it's grotesque"", one former minister commented ruefully to me.That barbed remark lays bare a real anxiety among Germans, that somehow the European Union's centre of gravity will shift once the UK has gone, that a delicate balance will be upset, and it will not be in Berlin's favour.Identifying Italy hints at one source of concern, that the southern Europeans will want to carry in their free spending way. What was for a long time the subtext of European debates, that Germany can be expected to subsidise the others because of war guilt as well as the strength of its economy, became increasingly overt during the Greek debt crisis. Now Italy, with far larger debts, is on a budgetary collision course with the EU.There is though another aspect to the comments one hears these days about how the post-Brexit EU might function, and it hints at a deeper and more emotive schism. If a generation of German politicians has hailed the European project as a triumph for peace this was at least in part because it has provided a way of converting long rivalry with France from the cause of 20th Century wars to the 'engine' of the Continent's economic success. Now though one hears disparagement of France and its president Emanuel Macron from different political quarters. A senior German journalist, commenting on the prominence given to Angela Merkel's meetings with President Macron to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice, said to me, anger in her voice, ""you see? This is our future, this will have to be our future partner, because you are leaving"".Meeting Alexander Gauland, leader of the right wing Alternative for Germany party in his spectacular office overlooking the Reichstag, he too cannot hold back on the subject on France.  ""The British are the only believers in free trade,"" he told us in a Newsnight interview, ""the French are bureaucratic in a way we don't like in our party"".Of course there are still pro-French voices in German politics, including those who feel that Chancellor Merkel has missed a real opportunity to build the Eurozone by spurning Mr Macron's proposals for further financial integration. But in my recent contacts at least, I have noticed rather more members of the German establishment who reject what the president stands for, suspecting another attempt to get Germany to finance French public spending and worrying about the destabilizing effect of Brexit.""For decades there has been a delicate triangle of power running Europe,"" the former minister quoted earlier says, ""and with Berlin, Paris, and London each playing their own distinctive role"". His concern is that removing the UK, with its big contributions to European security and financial prudence will lead to bigger problems for the EU. Germany, even during the long Merkel years, has been diffident about playing the leadership role in Europe. It is comfortable with tactical interventions on monetary or political matters, much less so in flexing diplomatic or military muscle. The prospect of Brexit has brought the realization that France may now try to fill this vacuum. While many German politicians are uneasy about the idea of leading Europe, it seems that the idea of letting President Macron (who one person I was talking to this week in Berlin called, ""a charlatan"") play that role by default disturbs them. Indeed it may rankle so much that it causes Germany to abandon its post Second World War reluctance to exert its power in Europe.You can watch Newsnight on BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or on iPlayer.

To find out, the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has organised a series of blind dates.Stanley Johnson, Boris Johnson's father, is a former Conservative MEP and founder of Environmentalists for Europe, who believes the UK would be better off remaining in the EU.Ella Whelan, author and journalist at Spiked, staunchly believes in Brexit.They went into the meal without knowing whom they would be meeting.But did they get on?How would you describe yourself? Barely blonde public-school boy. What are your views on Brexit? In the run-up to Brexit, I was very much for Remain. However, when Britain voted, I said, ""OK, we're going to leave."" But I am absolutely not in favour of Brexit along the terms the government is discussing. What was your initial impression? A real pleasure to meet her and obviously a first-class brain there. I found it hard to keep up, actually.How was your date? Lively stuff - it did me a lot of good to be exposed to someone who was deeply committed to the Brexit deal.What was the best thing about the date? The sausages were very good. What was the worst thing? Possibly being forced to concentrate for about two hours.What did you talk about? I argued that during my time in the EU, it was in a way quite exciting to be able to use the EU mechanisms to drive through projects and programmes and political decisions which it might have been harder to get through if you just worked at a national level, country by country.What was her most convincing argument? She did convince me that there are a lot of people out there who take Brexit very seriously indeed - it's not just a political football to be kicked around. Even if it did come to a second vote... I don't think that the Remainers would necessarily find it any easier to win the argument than they did last time round. Did you convince her on anything? Well I very much doubt that. That would be a first. I don't think I've ever convinced anyone about anything.Would you see her again? Absolutely, with great pleasure.Describe her in three words: Intelligent, articulate, attractive. Marks out of 10 for the date: Sounds a bit like Strictly Come Dancing - I'd give it an eight or a nine because I was intrigued and absorbed and actually fairly challenged by our discussion.Watch the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 10:00 and 11:00 GMT on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.What was your initial impression? A very, very, charming man - I was a little intimidated as he has been an MEP and is very knowledgeable in relation to the EU but we got on very well. How was your date? It went well, we agreed more than I thought we would, which was a nice surprise because it meant that we could actually talk about some of the finer points rather than going at each other's throats.What was the best thing about the date? Being taken out by a gentleman was a very nice thing to do. What was the worst thing? That we didn't get to finish the dinners because we were talking about Brexit too much. What did you talk about? We talked about the Irish border a lot, which I think is one of the most interesting things for me about looking at what's gone wrong with the Brexit discussion.Any common ground? We both agreed that what has happened to Brexit is a terrible sham.What was your biggest disagreement? We really disagreed on immigration and not how you'd think because I'm very pro-immigration and Stanley is quite anti it because he is very concerned about population growth. In another discussion, about immigration, we may not have got along as well as we did.Did he convince you on anything? No, but that's not because he wasn't thoughtful but because I think that this debate is the centre of my political outlook, so it would take more than an earthquake to change my mind on this. Would you see him again? We come from totally different backgrounds but sometimes once in a while that works. And he's a gentleman, so yes, why not?Describe him in three words: Charming, ardent and patient. Marks out of 10 for the date: Nine, because the conversation was very interesting but we didn't get to finish our dinner.

2018-11-25,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181125213026/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

She said the deal delivered on the result of the EU referendum - and MPs will get to vote on it on 11 December. But she admitted she was not ""entirely happy"" with the ""backstop"" contingency plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn said ""ploughing on"" with a deal opposed by the public and MPs was an ""act of national self-harm"".The Labour leader suggested Parliament would have ""little choice"" but to reject the deal when MPs vote on it.A host of former Tory cabinet ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Owen Paterson, Michael Fallon and Dominic Grieve, also said the deal was unsatisfactory, during the two-and-half hour debate. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable joined a number of Labour MPs and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas in calling for the prime minister to back another EU referendum ""with the option of remaining in the European Union"".Mrs May rejected all of these calls and told Sir Vince it was time to ""deliver on the choice the British people made"" in the 2016 referendum.Mrs May faces an uphill struggle to persuade MPs to accept the terms of the withdrawal agreement - and a political declaration on future relations between the EU and UK - approved by EU leaders on Sunday.Mrs May said there had been ""give and take"" in the 19-month negotiations but the final agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders.She acknowledged concerns over arrangements to avoid the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could see the UK entering a customs arrangement with the EU - known as the ""backstop"".The ""backstop"" was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use,"" Mrs May told MPs, and she insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force if the UK's future relationship was not settled by the end of 2020, as she hoped it would.A backstop of some kind would be required, she said, due to the UK's obligation to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace deal signed 20 years ago, adding ""there is no deal that comes without a backstop and without a backstop there is no deal"".She also insisted she had stood firm in the face of repeated EU attempts to link access to British waters for their fishermen to future trade arrangements, amid claims from the SNP and others that her deal had ""sold out"" Scotland's fishermen.The PM also said she regretted saying in a speech last week that Brexit would prevent EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". The comments sparked an angry backlash from EU citizens living in the UK.The Labour leader said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"" and that ""ploughing on is not stoic, it is an act of national self-harm"".He said the prime minister needed a ""plan B"" involving a permanent customs arrangement and stronger employment and environmental protections, which is Labour's Brexit policy. ""This deal it is not a plan for Britain's future,"" he added and that was why MPs had ""little choice"" but to reject it. Caroline Flint, one of the few Labour MPs who have signalled they could vote for the deal, urged Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to hold face-to-face talks to reach an accommodation acceptable to both parties.A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had ""no plans"" to reach out personally to Labour MPs who might back a deal, although her chief of staff had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement on Monday evening.The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"".And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application.Please upgrade your browserTory backbencher Mark Francois was among a host of MPs to urge PM to think again, claiming the agreement was ""as dead as a dodo"" and ""would not get through"" Parliament.  ""The House of Commons has never surrendered to anyone,"" he said. ""It won't start now.""And former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, previously regarded as a loyalist, said it would be a ""huge gamble"" for the UK to ""surrender our vote and our veto without any firm commitment to frictionless trade"" outside the EU. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was ""hard to see"" how the deal could provide certainty to business when cabinet ministers were saying different things about what they wanted. Following the debate, Mrs May was due to host more than 100 investors and employers from sectors including manufacturing, retail, food and drink and financial services to discuss the Brexit plan.Analysis by the BBC's Iain WatsonTheresa May told MPs her plan was in the national interest, delivering on the referendum result while protecting the economy.  But if this debate is a taste of things to come, the prime minister is in big trouble.  One MP after another, Remainers and Leavers alike, and across all parties, spoke out against Mrs May's plan. Indeed rarely can a prime minister have received such a mauling. Mrs May now has just over two weeks to try to rally support in Parliament. Asked repeatedly by MPs what the ""Plan B"" was if she lost the vote, she avoided a direct answer."

The US president did not specify which aspect of the deal concerned him but told reporters the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"".No 10 insisted the deal is ""very clear"" the UK would have an independent trade policy so it can sign trade deals with countries around the world.Mrs May fought off heavy criticism of her Brexit deal from MPs on Monday.Insisting the agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders, she said it would be put to an MPs vote on 11 December.Hours later, Mr Trump told reporters outside the White House: ""We have to take a look seriously whether or not the UK is allowed to trade.""Because right now if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that.""It would appear Mr Trump was suggesting the agreement could leave Britain unable to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States.However, responding to Mr Trump's comments, a Downing Street spokesman said the Brexit withdrawal agreement struck on Sunday would allow the UK to sign bilateral deals with countries including the US.""We have already been laying the groundwork for an ambitious agreement with the US through our joint working groups, which have met five times so far,"" the spokesman added.The BBC's North America Editor Jon Sopel said Mr Trump's comments were provocative, given trade would ""carry on in much the same way as before"" for the time being.""Donald Trump knew exactly what he was doing with these remarks,"" he said.""There is a very open line of communication between senior members of his administration and prominent Eurosceptics.""Please upgrade your browserDuring Mr Trump's UK visit in July - days after the British prime minister unveiled the proposals that formed the basis of the Brexit agreement - the US president had suggested an ""ambitious"" US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"".Billions of pounds in trade already flows between the UK and US - Britain's largest single export market.EU trade rules currently prevent the UK forging what some might view as a more advantageous bilateral trade deal with Washington.Under the deal agreed in Brussels, the UK would continue to trade with the US under EU rules until at least the end of the ""transition period"" in December 2020.During this transition - designed to allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment new post-Brexit rules kick in - the UK will be able to negotiate and strike deals with the US.However, they will be unable to come into force until 1 January 2021 and could be delayed further if the backstop is triggered. Tory Brexiteers fear the ""backstop"" written into the withdrawal agreement - which aims to prevent the return of customs posts on the Irish border in the event no UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal being agreed -  could result in Britain being tied to EU rules for the long term.In the Commons on Monday, Mrs May acknowledged the backstop was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use"" but insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force.She faced sustained criticism of the deal from MPs on all sides of the Commons.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"".The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"" while the Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas both called for another referendum.And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application.Tory backbencher Mark Francois was among a host of MPs to urge PM to think again, claiming the agreement was ""as dead as a dodo"" and ""would not get through"" Parliament."

He posted a photo of his mother's Parliamentary Pass on Twitter, which showed it still had four years to run. My mother passed away this afternoon in her sleep.

International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt described Lady Trumpington as a ""trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy"", while former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said she was ""admirable, decent and unique"".Conservative Deputy Chairman James Cleverly said on Twitter: ""So sad to hear that code breaking, two finger wagging, Baroness Trumpington has passed away. Ma'am, we salute you.""Her two-fingered gesture at fellow peer Lord King in 2011 introduced Lady Trumpington to a wider audience outside Parliament and she was soon appearing on programmes, including Have I Got News For You, Backchat and the Great British Menu.She had taken exception at remarks by the former defence secretary suggesting veterans of World War Two - of which she was the last remaining member in the Lords - were getting ""pretty old"".She was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George.In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government.But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate.  It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety."

Unacceptable for our European citizenship. The fight goes on with an emergency appeal before European Court oj justiceEnd of Twitter post  by @julienfouchet1UK Prime Minister Theresa May is now battling to persuade UK politicians to accept the Brexit deal she clinched with EU leaders on Sunday. The UK government is committed to exiting the EU next March.The EU Council - the body representing all the national governments - argued that opening Brexit talks was ""merely a preparatory act"" which did not affect citizens' rights.According to the court, those rights are likely to be affected, however, when the UK withdraws from the EU, with or without a Brexit deal.Mr Shindler lives in Italy, where he served with British forces in World War Two. There is a 15-year time limit on British expats being able to vote in UK elections or referendums.In May 2016, just before the Brexit vote, Mr Shindler and another British expat, Jacquelyn MacLennan, failed to persuade UK Supreme Court judges to change the law and enable them to vote. On Tuesday the ECJ is to hear a case brought by anti-Brexit Scottish politicians and activists, who want legal clarity on whether the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50, the EU withdrawal procedure."

""Over 150,000 of them - like my German husband, a GP here for over 30 years - felt absolutely thrown away, when they have spent decades here looking after us when we are ill."" Mrs May said she had always strived to protect EU nationals' rights during Brexit negotiations - and had ""delivered"" on that in the withdrawal agreement she agreed with the EU on Sunday. The PM said the point she was trying to make was a ""simple one"", that ""most people here in the United Kingdom"" want to see migrants ""coming and making a contribution"". ""They want people to be judged on the skills and the contributions to this country rather than simply on where they come from,"" she added.Mrs May made the controversial remarks, which sparked a backlash, in a speech to the CBI, in which she vowed to end free movement after Brexit.She said: ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi.""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer.""SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's words were ""disgraceful"" and EU citizens living in the UK said the comments would fuel hate crimes against them.The government says it wants the estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU nations already living in the UK to stay after Brexit but they will have to apply for leave to remain. It plans to publish its post-Brexit immigration policies shortly."
2018-11-26,Number crunching: Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46239782,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowNow the Brexit deal has been signed off in Brussels, attention turns to Westminster.MPs will get their say on whether they approve of the deal or not. Several days of debate will be followed by what's known as the ""meaningful vote"". This is expected to take place in the week beginning 10 December.Any attempt to work out the parliamentary arithmetic can only be an estimate so all numbers should be treated with caution. As things stand, though, there seems to be a majority against the proposed deal.Theresa May relies on the 10 Democratic Unionist Party MPs for her majority in the House of Commons. Their opposition to the proposed deal alone could make winning the vote tricky but the prime minister's problems don't end there.Some 57 Conservative MPs have signed up to the StandUp4Brexit campaign which argues that the proposed deal leaves the UK too close to the EU. (That includes Charlie Elphicke who is currently suspended from the party but generally votes with the government.)Added to those are the seven pro-Brexit MPs who resigned from government or party jobs on 15 November. And several more who have publicly stated they are opposed to the deal.Then there are, perhaps, a further dozen or so Conservative MPs from the Remain wing of the party who support the People's Vote campaign for another referendum or would like a closer relationship with the EU.All in all, there are around 80-90 Tories currently set to defy the government.Some of them have only said they can't support the deal which, perhaps, suggests, they might abstain when it comes to the crucial vote. But others are more hardline.On the other side of the calculation, there are a handful of pro-Brexit Labour MPs who might back the deal. And a further group who could vote for it to stop the possible alternative of a ""no deal"" Brexit.There's also one Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, who says he'll vote in favour of the deal to fulfil a pledge he made to his constituents.As things stand, though, this group isn't big enough to outweigh the DUP and Conservative rebels.Things can change of course. Mrs May will hope to persuade some of the rebels and more opposition MPs. But she has a long way to go."
2018-11-26,Nineteen months of wrangling - and that's just a taster,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46339623,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere was a definite ""battle of the tones"" at the seal-the-deal Brexit summit with Theresa May. EU leaders were determinedly sombre, while the UK prime minister had to sound upbeat and positive about her country's Brussels-free future.  It shouldn't be under-estimated. Sunday was a huge day for the EU, signing off on the divorce papers of a departing key member state for the first time in the history of the bloc. In the eyes of many, Brexit counts as an EU failure. The French President Emmanuel Macron reminded the press of the fragility of European Union. Which is why, time and again, EU leaders in Brussels continue to make so much of the (unusual) show of unity the Brexit process has provoked in EU ranks.For now, of course, all European eyes turn to the UK to see if the hard-negotiated Brexit deal passes through the House of Commons.If it doesn't, the President of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, insists there will be no deal. ""This is the deal. This is THE deal,"" he told me emphatically, ruling out the possibility of renegotiating the Brexit texts.If he's true to his word, and parliament votes down the divorce deal, then all 19 months of painful EU-UK negotiations were for nought. And both sides could find themselves staring at the cost and potential chaos of what Michel Barnier calls a non-orderly Brexit.EU leaders are hell-bent on avoiding that. So much so, that as much as  EU leaders regret Brexit, and as often as they have spoken at every EU summit so far since the Brexit vote about the door still being open for the UK to change its mind, there was none of that talk on Sunday. Instead, they were fully on message with Theresa May - to help her sell her deal back home. The Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, remarked that the prime minister had ""fought hard"" and that the result was a good deal. While the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said these had been ""extraordinary"", ""complex"" and ""difficult"" negotiations, resulting in an ""unprecedented and ambitious partnership"".All that talk of fair and fabulous deals somehow rings rather hollow, though, when the EU has made clear from the start that they would never concede a deal to the UK that made life look as good - or even better - outside rather than inside their club.But of course, this is not the final deal. The story of the EU and UK's tempestuous relationship is far from over.Maybe there will be a second vote on the Brexit deal in the UK parliament, or a second referendum or a general election. Until we know, we cannot be 100%  sure how the EU will react.But if, as seems likely, Brexit does indeed go ahead, it is only then that the detailed negotiations for a future EU-UK trade deal begin in earnest. And Mr Macron reminded us all at the Sunday Brexit summit of the horse-trading, arm-twisting and conflicting national interests of EU countries that will challenge those negotiations.The French president essentially threatened the success of a future EU-UK trade deal if the UK didn't guarantee access for French fishermen to UK waters after Brexit.  Now this should shock no-one. Fish, Gibraltar, the EU trying to tie the UK to its competition rules, even the Irish border backstop are all issues that were dealt with just enough to complete the Brexit deal texts but, in reality, the can was kicked down the road to the future trade negotiations.To sum up: these 19 months of endless wrangling over the Brexit divorce deal... they were a just a taster of what is yet to come."

US politicians perhaps, or maybe German privacy campaigners and EU regulators?No, my nominee is the member of parliament for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins. As chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Select Committee, Mr Collins has transformed what started as quite a limited and unfocused fake news inquiry into a forensic investigation of the conduct of Facebook.It is this committee that has provided a platform for whistleblowers such as Christopher Wylie and Brittany Kaiser, published all kinds of documents relating to the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and  demanded - so far without success - that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg appear before it.This weekend, Damian Collins showed just how far he was prepared to go in taking on a company he felt had shown an arrogant contempt for the British Parliament. He sent the House of Commons serjeant-at-arms to seize documents from an American businessman involved in a legal dispute with Facebook. That case dates back to 2015 and involves a developer, Six4Three, which was behind an app used to highlight photos of women in bikinis.The company was angry about changes in Facebook's rules, which restricted its access to user data, and the documents were provided to it as part of the disclosure process.We don't know what is in them - the US courts had ordered that they be sealed, preserving confidentiality during the case. But Mr Collins seems convinced they will prove relevant to the DCMS committee's inquiry into how another developer - Dr Aleksandr Kogan - was allowed to get access to data he handed to Cambridge Analytica. And he is considering whether to  publish them.Facebook is saying first that Six4Three's case is without merit and second that for the UK Parliament to publish documents sealed by the US courts would be hasty and wrong. In a waspish reply to Facebook's European public policy chief, Richard Allan, Damian Collins pointed out that ""as a member of Parliament yourself"" he should be familiar with its powers to order the production of documents and publish them with the protection of parliamentary privilege. Mr Allan is actually Lord Allan, a former Liberal Democrat MP given a peerage by Nick Clegg, who in a strange turn of events has now become Facebook's global public-relations and policy chief.The member for Folkestone and Hythe seems confident in his powers and on Monday afternoon DCMS committee members will meet in private to consider publishing the documents.On Tuesday, they hold a public hearing where Lord Allan, of Facebook, will be one of the witnesses and could face cross-examination about information the American legal system says should remain private.So has Damian Collins overreached himself this time? Taking on the American courts, using arcane procedures that have not been employed in living memory and getting involved in a case where a plaintiff seems to be arguing that Facebook was too strict about the use of data certainly seems risky.But do not underestimate the MP's determination to show a global social media giant that it is not above local laws."

It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety.She went from strength to strength, appearing as a no-nonsense panellist on TV programmes like Have I Got News For You - mocking the BBC for requiring her to sign a form to say she was not pregnant in her 90s.She attended debates in the Lords every day until her retirement from public life in 2017, at the age of 95.Even then, she found time to publish her life story, Coming Up Trumps, although she would shyly dismiss the ghost-written memoire.""I don't understand what all the fuss is about,"" she told one reviewer.  ""I didn't write the damn book and  haven't read it either.""Jean Alys Campbell-Harris was born on 28 October 1922.  Her father, Arthur, was a major in the Bengal Lancers and had served as an aide-de-camp to the viceroy of India. Her mother, Doris, was heiress to the fortune of a Chicago paint manufacturer.  The family was brought up in London in considerable privilege.  Her parents moved in a fast set which included the then Prince of Wales, later the Duke of Windsor, and future wife, Wallis Simpson.An army of servants attended to their every need at their huge house in Cumberland Place.  But her parents lost everything when her mother's fortune was wiped out in the 1929 Wall Street Crash. Her parents were forced to downsize and move to rural Kent and a house with no heating or electricity.  The servants were let go with one boy hired to clean the gas lamps.   Jean's playboy father joined his step-father's paint company and worked his way up from the bottom. Her mother pulled in society favours and became a successful interior decorator, roaring between jobs on her pre-WW1 motorbike.Their income meant their reduced circumstances fell short of penury.  ""We used to say my mother's idea of being poor was going to the Ritz on the bus,"" she recalled.  It was not a happy childhood. Jean was a ""daddy's girl"" but he wasn't around much.  The nannies gave her little affection and, later, boarding school was miserable.She was neither academic nor hearty which meant the other girls disliked her.  ""They had crushes on each other and on the games mistress,"" she told one interviewer.  ""I used to go with the local boys to the woods and smoke.""The young Jean was developing an independent spirit that would characterise the rest of her life.She left school at 15 having never sat an exam but fluent in French, German and Italian.  She was good enough at tennis to consider junior Wimbledon but ended up being sent to an equally miserable finishing school in France.As war broke out her parents wondered what to do with her.  The answer was found on a farm owned by the family of the former prime minister, David Lloyd-George, in Surrey.Jean worked as a land-girl and lived, on-site, in a small bungalow alongside Lloyd-George's much younger mistress, and later his wife, Frances Stevenson.  The famously priapic politician - who Jean would always describe as the ""old goat"" - would find reasons to stand her against a wall and measure her with a tape.""I suppose that was the nearest to flesh he could get with Miss Stevenson's beady eye on him,"" she told the Guardian.In 1940, her facility with languages changed her life.  Then 18, she joined the team cracking Nazi codes at ultra-secret Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.  She worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for Alan Turing's codebreakers who worked in complete isolation and with whom they never mixed.The work was ""deeply tedious"" but at weekends she had a ball.  She would hitchhike to London to stay with her friend, the newspaper proprietor and Cabinet minister, Lord Beaverbrook.  Her stentorian voice meant her lifts wisely kept their hands to themselves.Jean would meet friends at the Ritz and Claridge's which were legally required to serve meals for five shillings during wartime.  ""We would throw bread at each other and sing and behave so badly,"" she would reminisce.She was so well-known at the legendary French restaurant, the Bagatelle, that the band would strike up a special tune as soon as she entered the building. The lifestyle was fun but risky.  After one society ball in 1941, she arrived at the Cafe de Paris nightclub in London's West End moments after it was hit by two Luftwaffe bombs.  Thirty-four people were killed and dozens more injured. After the war she was determined to discover her mother's homeland for herself.  She went to America on the Mauretania with £4 in her pocket.Her brother got her a job in an advertising firm on Rockefeller Plaza but it was weeks until she was paid.  She survived on the crisps she found at society parties and by rummaging in the bins behind nightclubs.Jean loved the lifestyle.  The war was over and she was an in-demand party guest famous for dancing on tables.  She fell in love for the first time, to a man she would describe in her memoire only as ""The American"".She would, undoubtedly, have stayed but for the chance meeting with the historian and Eton schoolmaster, Alan Barker.  He had been wounded in Normandy at D-Day and had lost an eye at Monte Casino.  ""He was cosy,"" she said.  ""We just gelled.""When she travelled home to Britain for the Queen's coronation in 1953 he proposed.  She followed him to Cambridge where he had become headmaster of The Leys.  Their son, Adam, was born a year later. The life of a provincial school-teacher's wife suited her.  She adored entertaining the boys to tea.  She had not, however, lost her old rebelliousness.  She smoked, drank, jumped into swimming pools fully clothed and dancing around in a bathing costume to make the students smile for the school photo. Outside school, she partied at Cliveden with the Astors and kept active in Cambridge as a local magistrate.  On one notorious occasion, she had to leave the bench when the serial violent rapist brought before her turned out to be her vegetable delivery man.She was elected as a local councillor in the early 1960s and served as the city's mayor in 1971-72.  Her husband could often be jealous of playing second fiddle on ceremonial occasions so ""I decided not to make him mayoress as I thought that would make that worse"".When, in 1982, Barker suffered a stroke it was her work that kept her sane.  He died a few years later. She sought election to Parliament but was unsuccessful.  Instead, she threw herself into public service in prisons and as UK representative to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Her connections with the Conservative leadership eventually saw her appointed to the House of Lords.  She was great friends with Willie Whitelaw and, more importantly, one of the few women who could get on with Margaret Thatcher.Her relations with the prime minister were warm and she claimed this was because she was not afraid to stand up to her.""We got on terribly well. She was very good to me. I owe her everything. I went on the basis that I would be true to myself, say exactly what I felt, and if I got the sack, so what?""She became minister for health in 1985 although she refused to give up her passion for smoking.   John Major kept her on at Agriculture during his administration and she served as baroness-in-waiting to the Queen, which mainly involved meeting foreign dignitaries at airports.Her affection for the Lords ran deep.  Politically, she was a traditionalist - resisting change to the Upper House, campaigning against ""soft"" treatment of criminals and voting against the ban on foxhunting.And, on that famous occasion, gave her colleague Lord King a V-sign when he had the temerity to mention her advancing age during a Remembrance Day debate.  The incident made Lady Trumpington a late-life media personality. She was invited onto Desert Island Discs where she chose the crown jewels as her luxury in order to maximise her chances of rescue.At 90, she became the oldest ever panellist on BBC1's Have I Got News For You although she turned down the offer of a repeat appearance when Margaret Thatcher died because she did not want to poke fun at her political hero and mentor.To the end, Trumpers remained forthright and self-deprecating - putting much of her success down to blind luck.  She also stayed equally determined to enjoy life to the full.   ""I had a fantastic time during the war, doing a job that was very worthwhile, having fun when I went out on the town in the little time off that we were allowed and living life to the full whenever I got the chance.""And I still certainly do."""
2018-11-26,The Brexit guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration.Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on Tuesday, 11 December. If she clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.There are two documents.A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes:The other document is a 26 page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019.The declaration includes:This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs will vote on Tuesday, 11 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that."
2018-11-26,An impossible task for PM?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46352461,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIf you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home.How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance?Has she finally met her impossible task?In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something.And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too.Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union.......or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU......or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town.And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too.And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line.It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try.We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go."

On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion. The new work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons ""will stop no deal"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be"". And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was ""no majority for any route forward"". Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out. Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference? More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament. Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.The Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But perhaps there will be a general election instead? That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act and both involve motions of confidence in the Commons. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem."" That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period (and Number 10 has ruled that out) the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight. The clock won't wait. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  "

2018-11-26,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-26,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181127032218/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

She insisted it protected the ""vital interests"" of the whole of the UK when visiting Wales and Northern Ireland on Tuesday, while denying claims from DUP leader Arlene Foster that she had ""given up"" on negotiations before agreeing the Brexit deal.During a visit near Glasgow, Mrs May will speak to factory workers about how she believes her deal provides an ""unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has"" and certainty for employers and their staff.""We will be free to strike our own trade deals around the world, providing even greater opportunity to Scottish exporters,"" she will say.She will also say that moving away from the EU's common fisheries policy (CFP) ""which has so tragically failed Scotland's coastal communities"" will leave the UK ""free to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in our waters"".The UK sells nearly £1bn of fish produce to the EU every year, and a number of EU countries are insisting that tariff-free trade of that kind can continue only if EU fishing boats continue to get access to UK waters.Scottish Conservative Ross Thomson, has already voiced concerns the draft deal could lead to the ""continuation of some form of the CFP"".And Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled analysis the SNP claims shows Scotland would be left poorer by the deal.Her party, which has 35 MPs, along with the leadership of Labour, the Lib Dems and Democratic Unionists have all said they will reject Mrs May's deal. Many Tories have also said publicly they are opposed to Mrs May's deal. Meanwhile, a row is brewing after the Labour party demanded the government publish its full legal advice on the Brexit deal this week. The government has only said it will publish a ""full reasoned position statement"" laying its out political and legal position on the withdrawal agreement.BBC Newsnight political editor Nick Watt said a source says the full advice provides a ""very stark warning"" that there is no way the UK, on its own, would be able to get out of the so-called Northern Ireland backstop.The backstop - the plan to create a temporary single customs territory to prevent the return of customs posts at the Irish border in the event no EU-UK trade deal comes into force - is controversial because Brexiteers fear it would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely."
2018-11-27,MPs' fury over Mark Zuckerberg 'no-show',https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-46357359,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowPoliticians from nine countries reacted angrily to the absence of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at a hearing today.The event is part of an unprecedented international inquiry into disinformation and fake news.Richard Allan, Facebook's vice-president of policy solutions, appeared in Mr Zuckerberg's place.He said he took responsibility for deciding who appeared at which committee.9 countries.24 official representatives.447 million people represented.One question: where is Mark Zuckerberg? pic.twitter.com/BK3KrKvQf3End of Twitter post  by @CommonsCMSThe session was attended by parliamentarians from Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Ireland, Latvia, and Singapore as well as members of the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. Its chairman Damian Collins, has repeatedly asked Mr Zuckerberg to attend hearings.Lord Allan, who is also a Liberal Democrat peer, faced a grilling on various Facebook policies and actions in addition to the subject of why his boss wasn't there. ""We've never seen anything quite like Facebook, where, while we were playing on our phones and apps, our democratic institutions... seem to have been upended by frat-boy billionaires from California,"" remarked Canadian politician Charlie Angus.It had been thought that a cache of Facebook documents, seized by MPs from a US businessman on the grounds that they were relevant to the inquiry, might be shared - but Mr Collins said that they would not be published today.He later said that they will be published - possibly in the next week. Lord Allan said he believed it would be unfair to take ""internal conversations"" and ""robust comments"" as the company's official position.The Observer, which first reported the story about the documents being seized, said they included data about Facebook's privacy controls. They had been sealed by a US court, and Facebook has demanded their return.However, the contents of one email from 2014 were alluded to, in which a Facebook engineer reported unusual levels of Russian activity - namely that huge amounts of data were being pulled daily from devices with Russian IP addresses.Lord Allan was asked whether any action was taken, or authorities notified.He said the information he had was ""partial at best"" and that he would have to come back with more details.Facebook has since responded that its engineers had looked into the matter at the time and ""found no evidence of specific Russian activity"".The BBC understands that the data calls turned out to be legitimately coming from the  social media platform Pinterest, and that there were not billions of them as suggested in the hearing. Lord Allan was unable to name a single occasion when Facebook had banned an app for breaking its rules, despite saying that it was Facebook's policy to do so.In a later session, UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the hearing that Facebook informed her it had banned 200 apps during the summer of 2018.""I'm not aware of any case before the revelation [of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal]"", she said.Lord Allan also acknowledged that Facebook had ""damaged public trust"" through some of its actions and said the firm was in favour of a ""regulatory framework"" for the social media giant."

He posted a photo of his mother's Parliamentary Pass on Twitter, which showed it still had four years to run. My mother passed away this afternoon in her sleep.

She will be sorely missed in Westminster but long remembered for her outstanding ability and great humour. RIP Trumpers.""Her two-fingered gesture at fellow peer Lord King in 2011 introduced Lady Trumpington to a wider audience outside Parliament and she was soon appearing on programmes, including Have I Got News For You, Backchat and the Great British Menu.She had taken exception at remarks by the former defence secretary suggesting veterans of World War Two - of which she was the last remaining member in the Lords - were getting ""pretty old"".She was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George.In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government.But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate.  It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety.Conservative Party deputy chairman  James Cleverly, tweeted: ""So sad to hear that code-breaking, two finger-wagging, Baroness Trumpington has passed away. Ma'am, we salute you.""International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt described her as a ""trailblazer, heroine and an utter joy"", and added: ""Deepest sympathies to all who knew and loved this incredible woman.

2018-11-27,UKIP's O'Flynn defects to 'resurgent' SDP,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46357121,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowUKIP's ex-economic spokesman Patrick O'Flynn is leaving the party, blaming what he called leader Gerard Batten's ""fixation with Tommy Robinson"".He is joining the Social Democratic Party, claiming UKIP had become an ""impediment to Brexit campaigning"".Mr O'Flynn claimed many members had left because of the decision to employ the EDL co-founder as a party adviser.Mr Batten says Mr Robinson will help him turn UKIP into a ""mass movement ... a party for ordinary people"".In a statement on his website, Mr O'Flynn said that when he asked himself who the ""millions of sensible, moderate Brexit voters betrayed by establishment parties"" should vote for, the answer was ""clearly not UKIP"".He is joining the Social Democratic Party - best known as the SDP - as its sole MEP.Mr O'Flynn said UKIP had decided to put off a decision on former BNP and EDL members joining the party until after the UK leaves the EU.But Mr Batten had made Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, his policy adviser on rape gangs and prison reform at ""this vital stage of the battle for Brexit"".Mr O'Flynn added: ""Without any mandate from the membership or the party's elected ruling body to go down this path, Gerard is transforming what UKIP stands for and offers to voters. Many longstanding party members have already left as a result.""Of his new party, Mr O'Flynn said: ""I have decided to join the resurgent SDP, which campaigned for Brexit during the referendum and espouses broad and moderate pro-nation state political values that I - and I believe many of our voters from 2014 - will be delighted to endorse.""He said this would allow him to make a ""bigger contribution to the cause I was elected to pursue"".Mr O'Flynn was elected as a UKIP MEP for the East of England in 2014, and came fifth in the Cambridge seat in the 2015 general election.The former Daily Express and Birmingham Post political editor was UKIP's economics spokesman until 2015, and also held the party's media and sport brief.The SDP was set up by Labour's ""gang of four"" Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams in 1981 - they were seeking to ""break the mould of British politics"" after Labour's turn to the left under Michael Foot's leadership.The party went on to win seats and became a third force in British politics in alliance with the Liberals in the 1983 and 1987 general elections.The two parties later merged to form what is now known as the Liberal Democrats.Dr Owen, who opposed the merger, carried on leading a smaller SDP until 1990. The party has continued to exist since then, albeit without any notable electoral success.The current polices are not closely aligned with the SDP of the 1980s.Ahead of the 2017 election, SDP spokesman and former UKIP candidate Steven Winstone described the modern-day SDP as Eurosceptic.It has campaigned for Brexit, free breakfast and lunch for schoolchildren, removing tax for those on the minimum wage, and backed a series of annual referendums.Mr O'Flynn resigned from the UKIP front bench in 2015 after describing long-time leader Nigel Farage as changing from ""cheerful, cheeky and daring"" to appearing ""snarling, thin-skinned and aggressive"".The former leader later said Mr O'Flynn was 'big-hearted and honest'' when he later apologised for the comments.Last week Mr Farage said he would write to UKIP's ruling National Executive Committee to demand a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten as leader, saying he was damaging both the party and the Brexit cause.He described Mr Robinson as ""a man who's done four prison sentences, lives under a pseudonym and wherever he goes there's violence"".But Mr Batten defended his decision, describing Mr Robinson as ""courageous"". The decision was announced shortly after UKIP's NEC voted not to stage a ballot on whether to allow Mr Robinson to join the party.Mr Batten denied moving UKIP to the extremes or opening its doors to racists."
2018-11-27,Brexit deal is 'doomed' warns Fallon,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46356353,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May's Brexit deal is ""doomed"" and must be renegotiated, ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said.Sir Michael launched a scathing attack on the proposed EU agreement, saying it was the ""worst of all worlds"" and the PM's future was ""up to colleagues"".The prime minister is visiting Wales and Northern Ireland to argue her deal will bring certainty to business.DUP leader Arlene Foster told BBC News the trip was a ""waste of time"" as Parliament would not support her deal. Mrs Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives to support the government, said Mrs May had ""given up"" on trying to secure a better deal for Northern Ireland. While people were ""fed up"" with the Brexit process dragging on, that was not a good enough reason ""to accept what's on the table"", she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. Parliament will vote on whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future relations negotiated by Mrs May on 11 December.Sir Michael's decision to come out against the deal is a blow to the prime minister, who is struggling to muster support in Parliament for it. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Democratic Unionists have said they will vote against the deal while many Tories have said publicly they are opposed. Opponents of the deal say it will keep the UK too closely tied to EU rules and make it harder to strike future trade deals with other countries and minimise their value. US President Donald Trump has suggested the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"" and might hamper a future trade deal with the UK but Mrs May said this was not the case. In other developments:Sir Michael Fallon, who served as defence secretary under David Cameron and Theresa May before having to resign a year ago, told MPs on Monday the agreement was a ""huge gamble"" as it would see the UK give up its power to influence EU rules and regulations in return for vague assurances over future trade arrangements. He told BBC Radio 4's Today that ""this is not a good deal and we need a better deal"", saying that Mr Trump's criticism of its repercussions for transatlantic relations ""could not simply be brushed off"". ""My fear is that this deal gives us the worst of all worlds,"" he said. ""No guarantee of smooth trade in the future and no ability to reduce the tariffs that we need to conclude trade deals with the rest of the world.""So, unless the House of Commons can be persuaded somehow that those are possible then I think, yes, the deal is doomed.""Asked if Mrs May was also doomed, he replied ""that's up to my colleagues"", while stressing that a change of leader would not necessarily address the difficulties the UK now found itself in. When it was put to him that did not sound like an endorsement of Mrs May, he replied ""take it any way you want"".The prominent Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin said there was a lot of ""personal sympathy"" for Mrs May but her authority when it came to the Brexit agreement was ""collapsing"". Sir Michael said the 29 March 2019 date for Brexit, which is enshrined in UK law, may have to be pushed back to give negotiators the time to make major improvements to the agreement.All 28 EU states would need to agree to extend the Article 50 process of negotiations to allow this to happen, something Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out. Cabinet Office David Lidington said he did not think doing this ""would get us anywhere"" as the EU had made clear this was the only deal on the table.He told Today there was no ""Plan B"" and the agreement was a ""decent compromise"" which would provide a springboard to the next stage of negotiations on the two sides' future relationship.The prime minister is continuing to making the case for the agreement, which she says delivers on the 2016 referendum vote in key areas and is in the national interest. Responding to Mr Trump's comments, Downing Street has insisted the UK will be able to pursue an independent trade policy under the terms of the political declaration on future relations. During a visit to an agricultural show in Builth Wells, Powys, Mrs May said: ""As regards the United States, we have already been talking to them about the sort of agreement that we could have in the future.""We have a working group set up and that is working very well, has met several times and is continuing to work with the US on this.""Under the proposed agreement, the UK would not be able to complete any trade deal with a country outside the EU until the end of the proposed transition period - currently scheduled to last until 31 December 2020.In reality, any bilateral agreement between the UK and the US is likely to take years to negotiate given its complexity, differing standards in areas such as agriculture, and the fact it would require ratification by the US Congress."
2018-11-27,Labour drops probe into MP Austin,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46363295,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour will not be taking disciplinary action against an MP involved in a row over how it is tackling anti-Semitism.Ian Austin, the MP for Dudley North, faced possible suspension following an argument with chairman Ian Lavery in which he called the party's code of conduct on anti-Semitism a ""disgrace"". Mr Austin said he was glad at the outcome but hit out at the party's ""appalling"" handling of the case. Labour sources said he was reprimanded and warned about his future conduct. Mr Austin acknowledged he had a ""heated discussion"" with Mr Lavery last summer at the height of an internal fight within Labour over the extent of anti-Semitism within the party and the leadership's response to it. The MP condemned the party's decision, at the time, not to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and all its examples - a move that was subsequently reversed.The ex-minister, who is the adopted child of a Jewish refugee, has always denied ""screaming abuse"" at Mr Lavery.In a statement, Mr Austin said Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby had written to him to tell him that he would face no further action in connection with the episode.""I make no apologies for being upset about anti-Semitism,"" he said. ""I think every Labour Party member ought to be angry about racism and the failure to deal with it properly.""But I did not scream abuse, as was alleged, so I am pleased the Labour Party have dropped its threat to hold an investigation. Frankly, they should never have threatened this in the first place. ""The way this whole issue has been handled is unacceptable and the time it has taken is appalling.""Mr Austin has long been a critic of Mr Corbyn but insisted he and others urging a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism within Labour were not using the issue to undermine his leadership, as claimed by some of his supporters.Labour's NEC adopted the full IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in September but also approved a document alongside it vowing to uphold freedom of speech and legitimate criticism of the Israeli government.Mr Austin said Labour must not ""re-write or water down"" its code of conduct and rebuild the trust of the Jewish community by dealing with outstanding cases of anti-Semitism quickly.""The Labour Party's priority ought to be doing everything it can to win back the trust of the Jewish community, not investigating people like me for complaining about their failure to tackle anti-Semitism properly,"" he said.A Labour spokesman said all allegations of abusive behaviour were taken seriously and ""fully investigated in line with party rules and procedures"". Party sources said Mr Austin had been given a formal reprimand by the chief whip Nick Brown who ""made clear to him that shouting aggressively is not acceptable behaviour by a Labour MP"". Mr Corbyn has repeatedly said anti-Semitism is wrong and it will not be tolerated in the party. Mr Austin is the second Labour MP to be told there face no further action - a disciplinary inquiry into Labour veteran Margaret Hodge was dropped after she reportedly swore at Jeremy Corbyn and called him an anti-Semite."

The US president told reporters the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"" and meant the UK might not be able to trade with the US.No 10 insisted it is ""very clear"" the UK would be able to sign trade deals with countries around the world.Downing Street added that Mrs May is ready to defend her deal in a TV debate with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.It has been reported the debate could take place on 9 December - two days before the Parliamentary vote on Mrs May's deal.Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Right now if you look at the deal, [the UK] may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that.""It would appear Mr Trump was suggesting the agreement could leave Britain unable to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mr Trump's comments ""were not unexpected"" and negotiations on a trade deal with the US were always going to be ""challenging"". ""The United States is a tough negotiator,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""President Trump's always said very plainly 'I put America first'. Well, I'd expect the British prime minister to put British interests first.""The comments came after Mrs May fought off criticism of her Brexit deal from MPs on all sides of the Commons on Monday - insisting the agreement would allow the UK to regain control of laws, money and borders. Please upgrade your browserIn other developments:By BBC North America editor Jon Sopel Theresa May took a kicking in the House of Commons and then her closest ally, in the shape of Donald Trump, puts on his size 12 hobnail boots and joins in.When Donald Trump fired a broadside at Theresa May's Brexit deal there was nothing accidental or off the cuff about it. Senior members of his administration maintain close contacts with prominent eurosceptics in the Conservative party. But when the president says the agreement could jeopardise trade with the UK, it's hard to see what he means. During the transition period, business with the US would presumably carry on in exactly the same way as it does now. Yet all the time that Britain is in some way yoked to EU rules then there are limits to what can be negotiated in terms of a free trade deal - all points that have been made by those who campaigned for a more decisive Brexit. This intervention, coming post deal and pre-Commons vote, can only be interpreted in one way - the president is siding with the prime minister's critics. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal.Sir Michel Fallon has launched a scathing attack on Mrs May's Brexit deal, labelling it ""doomed"".The senior Conservative and long-standing party loyalist echoed Mr Corbyn's words when he described the deal as ""the worst of all worlds"".Asked if the prime minister was now also doomed, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That's up to my colleagues.""Given how loyal he’s been this is a v bad omen indeed for Number 10 https://t.co/cwWXmQFlTsEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakAs part of her two-week bid to convince MPs and the British public to back her deal, Mrs May will tell politicians and employers in Wales on Tuesday that they will have more power after Brexit, with more than 150 areas of policy passing to devolved parliaments and assemblies. She will also highlight the potential benefits to farmers of leaving the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.Then in Northern Ireland, she will tell representatives of the five main political parties her deal will allow employers to ""trade freely across the border with Ireland and have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom's market"".Northern Ireland has featured heavily in discussions about Brexit because both the UK and the EU want to avoid a physical border - with guard posts and checks - between it and the Republic of Ireland. The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a fall-back position - that would mean Northern Ireland would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products if a long-term trade deal is not agreed.The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's government, has accused the PM of breaking her promise that Northern Ireland would never be treated any differently from the rest of the UK - but the PM has said the backstop was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, under the terms of legislation already passed by Parliament. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal.Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said government officials were probably working on a ""plan B"" in case the deal was rejected but there would be ""no whisper of it"" publicly until the outcome of the Commons vote.He told the BBC that while the option of seeking changes to the withdrawal agreement remained on the table, if the defeat was extremely heavy then more radical alternatives, such as extending the talks, would have to be considered.""If Parliament rejects the deal by a significant majority and no deal is not now unacceptable there is a responsibility on the government to look seriously at options they have previously ruled out,"" he told Radio 4's Today.

The case has been brought by a group of Scottish politicians who oppose Brexit.They hope it will give clear guidance to the UK Parliament about the options open to it as MPs vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal - and that it will result in ""no Brexit"" being an alternative to either ""no deal"" or Mrs May's deal.The UK government says it has no intention of calling off Brexit, and says the politicians bringing the case are using it as ""ammunition"" in their campaign to halt the withdrawal process.The court also heard from lawyers representing the Council of the European Union and from the European Commission, who both argue that revoking Article 50 is possible - but that it would require unanimous agreement from the other 27 member states.They are concerned that the case could set a precedent where other countries would be able to formally notify their intention to leave and then seek better terms from the remaining EU countries, before cancelling their withdrawal.Analysis by Adam Fleming, BBC News in LuxembourgThere were two emotions on display in the ECJ's gold-encrusted courtroom: hope and fear. The UK government was worried that anything said about Brexit by European judges could be used as ammunition in the battle to bring down Theresa May's deal. The EU fretted about Article 50 being re-written in a way that meant a country could announce it was leaving then change its mind again and again, creating a state of permanent anxiety. Or worse, using it as a tactic to secure a better deal at the EU's expense. The campaigners who brought the case were just glad that the concept of Brexit being reversed had a very public airing so close to the vote on the deal by MPs. Hubert Legal, the chief lawyer for the European Council, argued that allowing unilateral withdrawal could therefore lead to ""disaster"", of which ""the main victim could be the European project altogether"".This was echoed by lawyers for the European Commission, who said states could act in an ""abusive"" manner by stopping and restarting the countdown clock, creating ""endless uncertainty"" - which the two-year time limit built into Article 50 was designed to guard against.A four-hour hearing on Tuesday morning saw the full court of 27 judges consider the arguments in the case. The court has said it will aim to decide ""quickly"" on the case, but has not yet set a date for doing so.The case is being considered against the backdrop of Prime Minister Theresa May fighting to sell her draft Brexit deal to MPs, ahead of a vote in the Commons in December.The UK will leave the EU on 29 March under the terms of ""Article 50"", a two-year notification of withdrawal which MPs triggered in March last year.The case has been brought by a cross-party group of Scottish politicians including Green MSPs Andy Wightman and Ross Greer, MEP Alyn Smith and MP Joanna Cherry of the SNP, and Labour MEPs David Martin and Catherine Stihler. They say it could give MPs an extra option when considering whether to approve the draft deal or not, because it could keep alive the prospect of calling off BrexitMr Wightman said the question was ""vital"", saying that ""the chaos around Brexit shows no sign of being resolved"" and that the UK parliament ""must be fully informed of all of its options"".Aidan O'Neill QC, who is representing the Scottish politicians, told the court that European lawyers were inviting the judges to act ""unconstitutionally and in contravention of the rule of law by reinterpreting the treaties"".He said: ""It cannot be in the interest of the union as a whole to force a member state to leave the union against the wishes of the people. ""The union's wider interest lies with member states remaining in the EU when their peoples wish to do so.""The UK government has opposed the case being heard from the outset, but failed to prevent it going before judges in Luxembourg after a series of appeals.The UK government's position is that the court has ""long refused for very good reasons"" to answer hypothetical questions which could interfere with domestic politics. They argue that because ""the UK does not intend to revoke its notification"", the question of whether it can do so unilaterally is a hypothetical one.Ms Cherry raised the case and the issue of revoking Article 50 with Mrs May in the Commons on Monday, prompting the prime minister to say that ""it is not going to happen because it is not government policy"".Advocate General Lord Keen, who is representing the UK government, argued in court that the case was being used as ""ammunition"" by opponents of Brexit, and said the judges should find it inadmissable."

But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements. ""Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,"" he said, ""they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing.""Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all.But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country.  That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important. And from an ""America-first"" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy.That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States.  We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep.And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier. The numbers are also instructive here. Last year the UK exported £274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported £341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were £112bn of exports and £70bn of imports. So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, ""a great deal for the EU"".There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union. The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower. That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in. It's not an absolute ""either-or"" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other. The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear. The EU is insisting on various ""level playing field"" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules. The political declaration says the level playing field should cover ""state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters"", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will ""demonstrate particular vigilance"" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter.  The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union. We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty. So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter. But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration.Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on Tuesday, 11 December. If she clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.There are two documents.A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes:The other document is a 26 page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019.The declaration includes:This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs will vote on Tuesday, 11 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that."
2018-11-27,Obituary: Baroness Trumpington,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43756361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShe was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George.In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government.But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate.  It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety.She went from strength to strength, appearing as a no-nonsense panellist on TV programmes like Have I Got News For You - mocking the BBC for requiring her to sign a form to say she was not pregnant in her 90s.She attended debates in the Lords every day until her retirement from public life in 2017, at the age of 95.Even then, she found time to publish her life story, Coming Up Trumps, although she would shyly dismiss the ghost-written memoire.""I don't understand what all the fuss is about,"" she told one reviewer.  ""I didn't write the damn book and  haven't read it either.""Jean Alys Campbell-Harris was born on 28 October 1922.  Her father, Arthur, was a major in the Bengal Lancers and had served as an aide-de-camp to the viceroy of India. Her mother, Doris, was heiress to the fortune of a Chicago paint manufacturer.  The family was brought up in London in considerable privilege.  Her parents moved in a fast set which included the then Prince of Wales, later the Duke of Windsor, and future wife, Wallis Simpson.An army of servants attended to their every need at their huge house in Cumberland Place.  But her parents lost everything when her mother's fortune was wiped out in the 1929 Wall Street Crash. Her parents were forced to downsize and move to rural Kent and a house with no heating or electricity.  The servants were let go with one boy hired to clean the gas lamps.   Jean's playboy father joined his step-father's paint company and worked his way up from the bottom. Her mother pulled in society favours and became a successful interior decorator, roaring between jobs on her pre-WW1 motorbike.Their income meant their reduced circumstances fell short of penury.  ""We used to say my mother's idea of being poor was going to the Ritz on the bus,"" she recalled.  It was not a happy childhood. Jean was a ""daddy's girl"" but he wasn't around much.  The nannies gave her little affection and, later, boarding school was miserable.She was neither academic nor hearty which meant the other girls disliked her.  ""They had crushes on each other and on the games mistress,"" she told one interviewer.  ""I used to go with the local boys to the woods and smoke.""The young Jean was developing an independent spirit that would characterise the rest of her life.She left school at 15 having never sat an exam but fluent in French, German and Italian.  She was good enough at tennis to consider junior Wimbledon but ended up being sent to an equally miserable finishing school in France.As war broke out her parents wondered what to do with her.  The answer was found on a farm owned by the family of the former prime minister, David Lloyd-George, in Surrey.Jean worked as a land-girl and lived, on-site, in a small bungalow alongside Lloyd-George's much younger mistress, and later his wife, Frances Stevenson.  The famously priapic politician - who Jean would always describe as the ""old goat"" - would find reasons to stand her against a wall and measure her with a tape.""I suppose that was the nearest to flesh he could get with Miss Stevenson's beady eye on him,"" she told the Guardian.In 1940, her facility with languages changed her life.  Then 18, she joined the team cracking Nazi codes at ultra-secret Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.  She worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for Alan Turing's codebreakers who worked in complete isolation and with whom they never mixed.The work was ""deeply tedious"" but at weekends she had a ball.  She would hitchhike to London to stay with her friend, the newspaper proprietor and Cabinet minister, Lord Beaverbrook.  Her stentorian voice meant her lifts wisely kept their hands to themselves.Jean would meet friends at the Ritz and Claridge's which were legally required to serve meals for five shillings during wartime.  ""We would throw bread at each other and sing and behave so badly,"" she would reminisce.She was so well-known at the legendary French restaurant, the Bagatelle, that the band would strike up a special tune as soon as she entered the building. The lifestyle was fun but risky.  After one society ball in 1941, she arrived at the Cafe de Paris nightclub in London's West End moments after it was hit by two Luftwaffe bombs.  Thirty-four people were killed and dozens more injured. After the war she was determined to discover her mother's homeland for herself.  She went to America on the Mauretania with £4 in her pocket.Her brother got her a job in an advertising firm on Rockefeller Plaza but it was weeks until she was paid.  She survived on the crisps she found at society parties and by rummaging in the bins behind nightclubs.Jean loved the lifestyle.  The war was over and she was an in-demand party guest famous for dancing on tables.  She fell in love for the first time, to a man she would describe in her memoire only as ""The American"".She would, undoubtedly, have stayed but for the chance meeting with the historian and Eton schoolmaster, Alan Barker.  He had been wounded in Normandy at D-Day and had lost an eye at Monte Casino.  ""He was cosy,"" she said.  ""We just gelled.""When she travelled home to Britain for the Queen's coronation in 1953 he proposed.  She followed him to Cambridge where he had become headmaster of The Leys.  Their son, Adam, was born a year later. The life of a provincial school-teacher's wife suited her.  She adored entertaining the boys to tea.  She had not, however, lost her old rebelliousness.  She smoked, drank, jumped into swimming pools fully clothed and dancing around in a bathing costume to make the students smile for the school photo. Outside school, she partied at Cliveden with the Astors and kept active in Cambridge as a local magistrate.  On one notorious occasion, she had to leave the bench when the serial violent rapist brought before her turned out to be her vegetable delivery man.She was elected as a local councillor in the early 1960s and served as the city's mayor in 1971-72.  Her husband could often be jealous of playing second fiddle on ceremonial occasions so ""I decided not to make him mayoress as I thought that would make that worse"".When, in 1982, Barker suffered a stroke it was her work that kept her sane.  He died a few years later. She sought election to Parliament but was unsuccessful.  Instead, she threw herself into public service in prisons and as UK representative to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Her connections with the Conservative leadership eventually saw her appointed to the House of Lords.  She was great friends with Willie Whitelaw and, more importantly, one of the few women who could get on with Margaret Thatcher.Her relations with the prime minister were warm and she claimed this was because she was not afraid to stand up to her.""We got on terribly well. She was very good to me. I owe her everything. I went on the basis that I would be true to myself, say exactly what I felt, and if I got the sack, so what?""She became minister for health in 1985 although she refused to give up her passion for smoking.   John Major kept her on at Agriculture during his administration and she served as baroness-in-waiting to the Queen, which mainly involved meeting foreign dignitaries at airports.Her affection for the Lords ran deep.  Politically, she was a traditionalist - resisting change to the Upper House, campaigning against ""soft"" treatment of criminals and voting against the ban on foxhunting.And, on that famous occasion, gave her colleague Lord King a V-sign when he had the temerity to mention her advancing age during a Remembrance Day debate.  The incident made Lady Trumpington a late-life media personality. She was invited onto Desert Island Discs where she chose the crown jewels as her luxury in order to maximise her chances of rescue.At 90, she became the oldest ever panellist on BBC1's Have I Got News For You although she turned down the offer of a repeat appearance when Margaret Thatcher died because she did not want to poke fun at her political hero and mentor.To the end, Trumpers remained forthright and self-deprecating - putting much of her success down to blind luck.  She also stayed equally determined to enjoy life to the full.   ""I had a fantastic time during the war, doing a job that was very worthwhile, having fun when I went out on the town in the little time off that we were allowed and living life to the full whenever I got the chance.""And I still certainly do."""
2018-11-27,An impossible task for PM?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46352461,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIf you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home.How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance?Has she finally met her impossible task?In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something.And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too.Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union.......or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU......or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town.And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too.And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line.It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try.We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go."

2018-11-27,Five scenarios,https://web.archive.org//web/20181128044256/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46320368,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIt feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? It is the burning question in Westminster and everyone has an opinion. The new Work and Pensions secretary Amber Rudd said the House of Commons ""will stop no deal"". Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was ""very difficult to predict at the moment what the final outcome will be"". And the former Tory cabinet minister (and now advocate for another referendum) Justine Greening said there was ""no majority for any route forward"". Which may be true but doesn't solve the huge political problem MPs will face if the deal is chucked out. Crucially, the default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next.Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. The motion would probably not be amendable, nor would its defeat carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. But with the Commons so fractured in its various objections would that make much difference? More significant could be panic on the markets and that might change minds in parliament. Alternatively, MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum.Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by the Political Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000. The Electoral Commission's recommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day. This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks.So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree.But perhaps there will be a general election instead? That is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem"" of a deadlocked parliament. That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act.Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later.Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government. This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it.This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in.Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit.Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process.Instead, she faces three fraught weeks and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.  "

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which is expected to happen on 12 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

In a speech to law enforcement leaders, he will say the ""heart of effective security is close co-operation"".Mr Wallace will say Theresa May's deal, which MPs vote on next month, sets the foundations for the most comprehensive security relationship in EU history.But Labour's Diane Abbott said the plan ""fails on guarantees for security"". The shadow home secretary's party is to table an amendment to reject the deal, but also ""prevent the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but, under Mrs May's deal, the UK and EU would continue to work together as they do now during a transition period, which is due to run until 31 December 2020.The deal for how the UK will leave the EU is accompanied by a non-binding declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK and the promise to co-operate on security after the transition period is set out in this document.MPs are due to vote on the deal on 11 December. If they reject it - and no other solution is found - the UK could leave without a deal and current arrangements on security co-operation would end on 29 March with nothing to replace them.Please upgrade your browserMr Wallace is due to speak at the International Security Expo in London, where he will say that such a no-deal departure would be a step backwards for security co-operation. He will say the UK, through the experience of the last few decades, has learnt the value of working with its European partners.""And we and Europe know, from bitter experience, that often when there is a mistake or when something has been missed that we find, time and time again, that it has been due to a failure of co-operation.""A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public.""In other developments: By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The UK wants to maintain all the existing security arrangements - and it knows that the EU wants to maintain this high level of co-operation out of mutual self-interest. But there are problems. Critics of the government's hopes for post-Brexit security are concerned that the proposed final relationship with the EU - that would kick in in 2021 - is long on aspirations but short on solutions.It's not remotely clear if the UK will be able to access EU-organised databases, such as those that exchange criminal records, wanted alerts and DNA and fingerprint records, after the transition. Once transition ends, so does access to the data - unless a security treaty can be agreed. But even if that treaty is signed, it may come up short. Some nations, like Germany, have constitutional bars on how they can co-operate on security with non EU states.  In his address, Mr Wallace will say that Mrs May's agreement would set the foundations for the broadest security relationship the EU has had with another country. The partnership would include the ability to exchange information on criminals and tackle terrorism, to quickly share data on people travelling to and from the UK to spot potential threats, to exchange DNA and fingerprints, and to fast-track extraditions.Ms Abbott described the government plans as ""dangerously flimsy"". She said: ""There is no new security treaty on offer, which is vital for cross-border policing arrangements, especially extradition.""She added that there were ""only aspirations for a vague security partnership, no plans for proper security arrangements, including with Europol"" and that it was ""simply unacceptable"". As the vote on the PM's deal draws closer, details of what will happen in Parliament during the build up were released. The Commons will debate the agreement for eight hours a day on 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 December under business proposals set out by the government.But MPs will be allowed to table six amendments to the Brexit motion, to be chosen by Commons Speaker John Bercow and heard before the vote on 11 December. Labour has put forward an amendment ""rejecting Theresa May's botched Brexit deal"" and to stop a no-deal, calling for all options to be left on the table if it gets voted down. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the deal ""is a miserable failure of negotiation by a government that has wasted the last two years fighting with itself, rather than securing a better deal with the EU"".Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis called the amendment ""shameful and irresponsible behaviour"", adding: ""All they are interested in is trying to force a general election."""
2018-11-28,Referendum may be inevitable - McDonnell,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46373787,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShadow chancellor John McDonnell has suggested it is ""inevitable"" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election.An election remains Labour's preferred option if - as is widely expected - MPs vote down Theresa May's Brexit deal on 11 December.The shadow chancellor said forcing an election would be ""very difficult"".And if it was not possible, he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the party would push for another referendum.Mr McDonnell told the BBC's political editor: ""We want a deal that will protect jobs and the economy.""If we can't achieve that - the government can't achieve that - we should have a general election, but that's very difficult to do because of the nature of the legislation that David Cameron brought forward.""If that's not possible, we'll be calling upon the government then to join us in a public vote. It's difficult to judge each stage, but that's the sequence I think that we'll inevitably go through over this period.""Asked by Laura Kuenssberg if a vote of no confidence did not bring down the government and lead to a general election, a second referendum was ""inevitable"", Mr McDonnell replied: ""That's right. ""Our policy is if we can't get a general election, then the other option which we've kept on the table is a people's vote.""Asked about shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's claim that the Leave side could win another referendum, he said: ""It might do. It's very difficult to call at the moment.""He said most of the Labour MPs campaigning for another referendum were the ""strongest Remainers"".""So, the caution for them and for all of us, whichever argument you put, is the people will decide. As we saw in the last referendum, it's very difficult to predict which way the people will decide on this. ""I've seen a lot of polls that have said there has been a shift from Leave to Remain. I've also seen other polls saying actually we're just about the same as we were then.""He said he had voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum and he believed it was still the ""best option"" but he also respected ""the wishes of the people"".If there were to be another referendum, he said, there would be a ""debate"" in the Labour Party about its position but it could not support Theresa May's ""current"" deal, if that were on the ballot paper.Prime Minister Theresa May, who is Conservative Party leader, said that Mr McDonnell's comments about another referendum showed that ""the true Labour position"" was that they want to ""frustrate Brexit"".Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister said another referendum would be a ""betrayal of the vote of the British people"" adding that the Government had negotiated a deal that ""delivers Brexit"" while ""protecting jobs, protecting livelihoods, protecting security and protecting our United Kingdom"".A fresh referendum could be held only if the government legislates for one and a majority in the Commons supports it.Theresa May has faced repeated calls to hold another referendum from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Green and a small number of Conservative MPs, who are members of the People's Vote campaign, but has always rejected them.Under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron's coalition government, a general election can be called if two-thirds of MPs vote for one.Alternatively, if a majority of MPs back a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, a 14-day period is allowed for a new government to be formed with the approval of MPs. If no such vote is passed, a new election must be held."
2018-11-28,May says Brexit deal is 'good for Scotland',https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46361492,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe prime minister has insisted her Brexit agreement is a ""good deal for Scotland"" that will protect jobs and provide new opportunities for business. Theresa May was speaking as she met factory workers in Renfrewshire as she seeks to build support for the plan.Her proposals have faced strong criticism from opposition parties - as well as from many of her own MPs. But she says the country is facing a straight choice between her deal, or leaving the EU without any deal.Ahead of Mrs May's visit to Scotland, the UK government published analysis which suggested the country's economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years under her Brexit plan, compared with staying in the EU - but that a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit.The Bank of England subsequently warned that a no-deal Brexit would send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis.Mrs May's proposals are opposed by Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, the Democratic Unionists and many Conservative MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate - meaning she currently looks unlikely to get parliamentary approval for her deal.On Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon unveiled a Scottish government analysis paper which claimed the Brexit deal could cost Scotland £9bn a year by 2030, compared to if it had remained in the EU.Ms Sturgeon, who wants the UK to remain permanently in the single market and customs union and has backed calls for another referendum on the Brexit terms, has said the SNP's 35 MPs at Westminster will vote against the deal on 11 December.But the prime minister said the deal she had negotiated for the UK would be a ""good deal for Scotland"" as it would provide a ""free trade area with no tariffs, no fees"".She added: ""That will mean a opportunity to carry on their trade. but also gives us the opportunity to negotiate trade deals around the world that will be good for great Scottish exports like Scotch Whisky, Scottish salmon and smoked salmon. ""So this is a deal that is right for Scotland and right for Scottish fishermen, because we'll take back control of our waters and ensure they have a bright future for Scottish fishing.""Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested it is ""inevitable"" another EU referendum will be called if Labour are not able to force a general election.But Mrs May said his comments were proof that Labour ""want to go against and overturn the vote of the British people"".The UK government has highlighted the support the deal has received in recent days from Diageo, National Farming Union Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association and BAE Systems, who have also warned about the consequences of ""no deal"" for Scotland.Jim Ratcliffe - the owner of chemicals giant Ineos, which operates the Grangemouth facility - has also said Mrs May's deal had his ""full support"", describing it as a ""pragmatic and sensible arrangement"".The company said its analysis showed a no-deal Brexit would carry ""significant risk"" for its business, and urged MPs to ""put the good of the country ahead of political considerations and ensure a safe passage for the deal through Parliament.""The trip to Scotland was the latest stop in a two-week tour by Mrs May as she tries to promote and sell her deal to the public and business.On Tuesday, the prime minister made similar visits to Wales and Northern Ireland - where she faced criticism from Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster, whose party has a parliamentary pact to support the Conservative government in key votes.And speaking as she unveiled the Scottish government's latest Brexit analysis paper, Ms Sturgeon said the deal was ""unacceptable to the Scottish government and damaging to the people of Scotland"". The document included analysis - first published in January - claiming that a new free trade agreement could leave Scots £1,600 worse off per year by 2030, compared to a scenario where the UK remains in the EU.It also warned the ""backstop"" being put in place to prevent the return to a hard border in Ireland could leave Scotland at a ""serious competitive disadvantage"" to Northern Ireland.Ms Sturgeon said: ""It will not end uncertainty. It will extend it. We are being asked to accept a blindfold Brexit with all the difficult decisions kicked down the road."""

Here's what happened.Will the UK be worse off under the prime minister's Brexit plans or not? That was the question Jeremy Corbyn wanted answering at this session, after the Treasury published an analysis suggesting the UK would be less well off under all Brexit options when compared with staying in the EU.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt had said Mrs May's deal would mitigate ""most"" of the negative impacts of Brexit, said the Labour leader. Which of the negative impacts would not be mitigated?Mrs May said her deal was the best available to protect the economy and ""honour"" the EU referendum result. The ""biggest risk"" to the economy was a Labour government, she added.""It is not hard to be the best deal if it is the only deal,"" observed the Labour leader, ""by definition it is also the worst"".In fact, he went on, there was no deal ""just a 26-page wish list"".

My weekend shopping list is longer than that.""The Labour leader quoted a damning UN report, which had said it was ""clear"" the impact of Brexit on people in poverty was an ""after-thought"".If the PM's deal was so great, he asked, why were MPs ""not queuing up"" to back it?Farmers in Wales, fishermen in Scotland and employers in Northern Ireland were backing it, claimed the prime minister.She defended the government's economic record, saying figures today showed the number of children living in workless households was ""at a record low"".Mr Corbyn quoted the UN report again, which said there were 14 million people living in poverty in the UK. He then quoted business leaders, who had said her Brexit deal was the ""worst of all worlds"".She had gone from ""guaranteeing frictionless trade, to offering friction and less trade"", said the Labour leader, and the country had ""no faith"" in the next stage of talks being completed within two years.Did the PM prefer ""extending the transition with further vast payments to the European Union or falling into the backstop with no exit"", asked Mr Corbyn.There is an exit ""from the backstop"", said Mrs May, and it was ""perfectly possible"" to turn the 26-page political declaration into legal text within two years.Then it was on to the attorney general's legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, which Labour wants published in full. Mrs May had petitioned Tony Blair for the full legal advice on the Iraq war to be published, said Mr Corbyn, what has changed?Mrs May cited client confidentiality and said MPs would get to see a ""full reasoned position statement"" and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would make a statement and answer MPs questions.Mr Corbyn said the government was the most shambolic ""in living memory"" and 20 of her own ministers had resigned. It was ""clear that Parliament will not back this plan"", he told the PM and it was time for her to ""accept that reality, make way for an alternative plan that can work for the whole country"".Mrs May said she ""will take no lectures"" from someone who has had more than ""100 resignations"" from his frontbench.She said ""what really lies behind Labour's approach"" was a desire to ""cause chaos, frustrate Brexit and overturn the will of the British people... that would be a betrayal of the many by the few"".The SNP's leader at Westminster Ian Blackford also made hay with Philip Hammond's comments on the economic impact of Theresa May's Brexit plans.SNP's @IanBlackfordMP ""Does the PM agree her [#Brexit] deal will leave people poorer than the status quo?""Theresa May: ""No...

Hmmm.Jeremy Corbyn enjoyed himself in a target-rich environment, noting that Theresa May once demanded that Tony Blair published his advice on the legality of the Iraq War, and highlighting the opposition to her Brexit deal among her own MPs.But the real threat to the PM was behind her, on the Conservative benches. Brexiteers Anne Marie Trevelyan, Peter Bone and David Amess all attacked aspects of the deal, and received polite rebuffs.And the Scottish Conservative Douglas Ross raised the dangers of a fisheries deal which did not meet promises to the fishing industry.The PM sailed through it all… this was much of a muchness with the questioning in the series of Brexit statements over the last fortnight. And perhaps the sense of déjà vu drained some of the hostility from this latest repeat performance.Hard Brexiteers to the right of her, Remainers to the left, Labour with its cannons trained on her, and leadership rivals lurking under camouflage, the PM seems to be heading for certain defeat in the Meaningful Vote in a fortnight.Yet on she goes.Westminster is, frankly, a bit baffled.Does she have some masterstroke to deploy? Has she banked the prospect of defeat and based her strategy on a second vote to get through a slightly tweaked deal - with modest concessions from Brussels already prepared and waiting?Or is she simply hoping against hope that her opponents, internal or external, will somehow retreat at the last moment.Is it magnificent? Is it politics?We'll know in a fortnight.Remember, Theresa May will be at the dispatch box for PMQs the day after the Meaningful Vote. Maybe all will be revealed two weeks today."
2018-11-28,No-deal Brexit could sink UK into recession,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46377309,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA no-deal Brexit could send the pound plunging and trigger a worse recession than the financial crisis, the Bank of England has warned.It said the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath if there was no transition period, while house prices could fall by almost a third.The Bank of England also warned the pound could fall by a quarter. The Bank's analysis comes after the Treasury said the UK would be worse off under any form of Brexit.This Bank's scenario is not what it expects to happen, but represents a worst-case scenario, based on a so called ""disorderly Brexit"".The scenario looks at the five-year period after the UK leaves the EU.But by the end of 2023, the economy is expected to resume growing.""These are scenarios not forecasts. They illustrate what could happen not necessarily what is most likely to happen.""Taken together the scenarios highlight that the impact of Brexit will depend on the direction, magnitude and speed of the effect of reduced openness of the UK economy,"" Bank of England governor Mark Carney said.The Bank of England has made a number of assumptions - not forecasts - about what would cause a disorderly Brexit.The Bank of England does not give a probability of this happening.Scenarios drawn up by the Bank of England show that GDP would fall by 8% in 2019 against its current forecast.Growth would quickly resume and the economy would expand again by the end of 2023 but be smaller than where it was before.Unemployment would rise to 7.5%, house prices fall by 30% and commercial property prices collapse by 48%.Interest rates would reach 4%.The Bank looked at three other scenarios.A close relationship is one with no customs checks, no regulatory barriers and a partial deal agreed on financial services.A less close relationship is one where customs checks start after 2021 and other regulatory checks are put in place.If Brexit is disruptive rather than disorderly, GDP falls 3% over the five years to 2022, house prices slide 14%, and unemployment reaches 5.75%If a close trading relationship is agreed, the economy could still be 1% smaller than if the UK had remained in the EU but 1.5% higher than the bank's most recent estimate.If it is less close, the economy's growth could be 3.75% less than if the UK had remained in the EU and 0.75% less than forecast over the last inflation report.These figures cover the period to 2023.By political reporter Brian WheelerTheresa May will not have told the Bank's economists what to say in their report but it is definitely helpful to her. The timing is significant too.A leaked copy of Downing Street's media grid had today down as ""economy"". Tomorrow is ""security"".So expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit in the run up to 11 December's vote.  Downing Street's hope is that however much they hate her deal (and they do) MPs will come to view it as the only safe option.The problem is that these kind of warnings, however well-grounded in facts and figures, are too easily written off as ""project fear"". The more scary they sound, the easier they are to dismiss.Conservative MP and Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound - saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"". Speaking to the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"". And the pro-Brexit former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said: ""The bottom line of both sets of reports is that project fear like Frankenstein's monster has been resuscitated and is stalking the land.""However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The Bank has confirmed what other independent reports this week have been telling us: a no-deal Brexit could be even worse than the financial crisis of 10 years ago, and the country would be much worse under Theresa May's deal,"" he said.Mr Carney said the Bank was monitoring markets and indicated that it was ready to lend to UK banks if necessary.He also indicated that banks might be allowed to hold less capital if risks became too great.But he warned there was little the Bank could do.""There is little monetary policy can do to offset the potentially significant hits to productivity and supply that Brexit could entail... the future potential of this economy and its implications of jobs, real wages and wealth are not in the gift of central bankers,"" he said.The Bank of England has exposed seven major lenders to a stress test which it said was two and half times more severe than the Brexit scenarios.All seven lenders - Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Standard Chartered, Santander and Nationwide Building Society - passed the test."

That is after all the question we want answered. One problem is that it will be harder to judge when we look back whether the figures were right, because we would be comparing what actually happened with a hypothetical alternative that didn't.The same applies to the impact on the government's finances. That said, all the scenarios in the analysis show an adverse effect; the saving on contributions to the EU is more than offset by the lower tax revenues that would result from the weaker economic growth. There are also some striking differences in regional economic impacts. In the no-deal situation the biggest effects are in North East England and the West Midlands. London gets away with least damage in that situation, but the capital is worst hit in the government's preferred option. That is because London specialises in services that would gain less, compared to no deal, than manufacturing from the relationship the government is seeking to negotiate. "

The Treasury says the economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years Mrs May's plan, compared with staying in the EU.But they claim a no-deal Brexit could deliver a 9.3% hit.Chancellor Philip Hammond said the deal was not just about the economy, but would deliver ""political benefits"".Speaking at an event held by the Economists for Free Trade in London, Mr Davis, who quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit plans, said the government figures were part of a ""propaganda onslaught"" ahead of a vote on the deal on 11 December. He said: ""Treasury forecasts in the past have almost never been right and have more often been dramatically wrong.""Mr Davis said predictions that the economy in the UK would contract by 2.1% in the 18 months after the referendum were unfounded - in fact it grew by 2.8% - along with other concerns around unemployment and incomes.""None of this spine-chilling nonsense came to pass,"" he said.The prominent Brexiteer also used his speech to continue his criticism of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement for leaving the EU and the political declaration for the future relationship. He said that it would leave the UK subject to EU single market rules and ""annexes"" Northern Ireland.Any MP voting in support of the PM's deal would ""repudiate"" the wishes of the public and cause ""incalculable"" damage to the country's democracy, Mr Davis added. And he claimed it would also deprive the UK of the ""chief economic benefits"" of Brexit by stopping it from negotiating free trade deals around the world.But Mr Davis had no fear around leaving with a no deal and reverting to World Trade Organisation rules, saying it would ""involve all the choking tentacles of the EU falling away"".""The future of the UK economy does not lie with the EU but with the wider world,"" he said.The government earlier published a 83-page document on the long-term economic impact of Brexit on the UK. It compares the likely impact of Mrs May's deal with the alternative scenarios of Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area, a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU and a no-deal Brexit.It says that GDP will be lower in 15 years under all Brexit scenarios than it would be with EU membership. And in all cases, national income will be reduced if migration from Europe is reduced from its current levels.But Chancellor Philip Hammond said that staying in the EU was not politically ""viable""."
2018-11-28,Ban on military grade rifles dropped,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46377250,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA planned ban on military grade assault rifles has been dropped amid pressure from some Conservative and DUP MPs.The ban on .50- or higher-calibre weapons was initially included in the Offensive Weapons Bill, driven by concerns over a growing black market trade in such weapons.But an amendment tabled by Home Secretary Sajid Javid removing the proposal has now been backed by MPs.The decision has been described as ""staggering"" by MP Louise Haigh.""Senior officers have warned the police have no known protection against these destructive weapons and yet ministers have trooped through the lobby to remove this ban from their own Bill,"" Labour's Shadow Policing and Crime Minister added.Speaking in the House of Commons, she accused the government of having ""watered down"" the bill's proposals, saying it had ""rolled over"" in the face of its backbenchers.Independent MP John Woodcock echoed her words, saying the government was prioritising party politics over national security.Almost 70 MPs had backed an earlier amendment to the bill to drop the ban before Mr Javid's intervention on Friday.  They said they wanted to allow sports shooting enthusiasts to continue to use ""high energy rifles"" if they have installed enhanced security measures.Critics of the proposed ban also argued the weapons were not used in serious crime, with Conservative Jonathan Djanogly, who is chairman of the British Shooting Sports Council (BSSC), telling fellow MPs they are too heavy and expensive.Conservative MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, who put forward the earlier amendment, added the rifles ""do not pose a danger to the public"".MPs were also being asked to consider strengthening legislation around air rifles, including requiring guns be kept in a locked cupboard, with the key kept separately.Labour's David Hanson, who tabled the clauses, said the change was needed to improve safety.The former minister cited the case of a 13-year-old constituent, George Atkinson, who was killed in a ""tragic"" air rifle accident. The weapon had not been locked in a cupboard.He said the clauses would not prevent anyone owning an air rifle, but would make ""the reasonable precautions measurable"".""And I think it's important that for the memory of children and young people like George Atkinson that we seek to have reasonable precautions,"" he added."

The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row that had followed, the women had said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she had made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, with her accusers saying she had confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation.Acquitting her, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession had been delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"".Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong.Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base.But critics say the laws have often been used to exact revenge after personal disputes and that convictions are based on thin evidence.The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community, who identify themselves as Muslims but are regarded as heretical by orthodox Islam. Since the 1990s, scores of Christians have also been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population.The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy. "

One of two women involved later made a written statement.There had previously been two separate allegations in 2016, although one was in the form of an anonymous letter.Under questioning, Mr Greenough agreed one allegation by a woman known as Miss C could have been made in 2015 but he did now know about it until 2016.He told the court when the reshuffle where Mr Sargeant lost his job - on 3 November 2017 - he was present in the room when Mr Jones spoke to every other minister, apart from the meeting with Alun Davies AM.Asked by the coroner whether any information was mentioned regarding any of the women, Mr Greenough said: ""Not in my presence"", and told the Sargeant family's counsel Leslie Thomas QC he did not believe Mr Jones could have had a conversation with anyone without him knowing.Special advisor Jane Runeckles said discussions about the reshuffle had begun in the summer of 2017 between her, ""Matt and the first minister"".Speaking about a meeting on 18 October 2017, she confirmed there were ""rumours"" about Mr Sargeant. However, Mr Sargeant was still in consideration for leader of the house, the inquest heard.The coroner said he struggled to understand how that might still be the case, to which she replied: ""The first minister was absolutely clear at that point that it was tittle-tattle. He had nothing to suggest otherwise.""The reshuffle had been motivated by a commitment Mr Jones had made to bring one particular AM into government and because he felt some people had not been given opportunities under previous governments, she told the inquest.Mr Jones is due to give evidence later on Wednesday.On Monday, the inquest in Ruthin, heard Mr Sargeant's body had been found at his home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, by his wife Bernadette on 7 November 2017.He had left a letter apologising to his family and telling them: ""I have failed you."" The letter continued: ""You deserve none of this publicity 'cause of my acts.""The inquest also heard evidence Mr Sargeant may have used an unknown phone to make calls on the morning he died.Telephone records of one of his friends and former colleagues, Sophie Howe, the future generations commissioner, have been requested to try to establish what phone he was using.If you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line ."
2018-11-28,"UK ports face 'major disruption', MPs warn",https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46363679,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThere is a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK ports in the case of a no-deal Brexit, according to MPs.The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said government preparations for avoiding disruption around major ports were ""worryingly under-developed"".Committee members also said there was a ""real risk"" the Department for Transport (DfT) would not be ready for a hard Brexit.The DfT said the committee's conclusions were not ""accurate"".In a statement it said it was ""both disappointed and surprised"" that the PAC had ""failed to reflect"" the evidence in the National Audit Office's report ""which found that the department has made a determined effort in its preparations and achieved a great deal"". The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The PAC is responsible for scrutinising the value for money of public spending, and holding the government to account for the delivery of public services.It has published a series of reports looking at different government departments' preparations for Brexit.As with these previous reports, it was ""concerned about how well government is prepared"".Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: ""The future of road, rail, maritime and air access to Europe after Brexit remains unclear and the Department for Transport has a critical role in ensuring the UK is prepared.""With so little time remaining, there is still much to do. The risks associated with no-deal are severe, yet plans for avoiding disruption around major ports in particular are worryingly under-developed.""The DfT intends to introduce ""Project Brock"", to deal with lorry queues on roads to Dover for cross-Channel journeys. The plan involves holding coast-bound lorries on the M20 so traffic not heading for the port can carry on moving.Much of the criticism in this report from MPs is centred on the notion that the Department for Transport (DfT)'s preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario have been too secretive. They argue that it makes it harder for the wider business community to plan.We have known for some time now that the government has been using non-disclosure agreements when it has been discussing no-deal plans with transport companies. Some details have leaked out. For example, I've been told that officials have been asking ferry companies about their capacity to carry vital supplies in the event of EU customs checks causing disruption at the border. The DfT says preparations need to be kept secret to avoid them damaging the commercial interests of the firms involved. And details of Operation Brock, the department's £35m plan to keep traffic flowing freely on the M20 near Dover, have been published, as well as other preparatory schemes, like the one to ensure that holiday-makers travelling to the EU can access international driving permits. However, the Public Accounts Committee feels it hasn't been able to properly scrutinise many aspects of the department's no-deal planning and it argues that has contributed to its perception, outlined in this report, that the DfT is being ""complacent"" and that there is a risk that our transport systems and infrastructure won't be sufficiently prepared for ""no deal"" come 29 March.Ms Hillier said the DfT planned to spend £30-£35m on Project Brock, but had not yet carried out proposed ""desk-based"" testing.Engagement with businesses had been ""poor"", she added.""The secrecy around the department's preparations and the shortcomings in assurance on its progress are a potentially toxic combination."" The PAC recommended that the DfT should write to it before Christmas ""setting out the results of any testing of Project Brock, and how wider plans to keep ports across the UK open for business have progressed"". The Road Haulage Association's chief executive Richard Burnett said the report had confirmed what many members had told the body. ""Information has been patchy, often unhelpful, confusing and generally too little, too late,"" he said. ""This has left hauliers at the sharp end of a bad Brexit outcome, struggling to keep the supply chain operating and their firms in business.""The PAC said it acknowledged the ""difficult situation"" for the DfT in having to prepared for all Brexit scenarios. However, it felt the department must be ""open about the challenges it faces and work with business and stakeholders to help them get ready for what the future brings""."

It looks like they will get some help to do so from at least some of the prime minister's own MPs.And with at least a suspicion that Theresa May could try to get her deal - or something awfully close to it - through at the second attempt, Labour waverers don't seem to have much incentive to break ranks on 11 December.This would risk the ire of party members and very possibly still not deliver enough votes for the deal to pass.Indeed some of those Labour politicians from Leave areas who had mulled over backing a government-brokered deal, such as Wigan's Lisa Nandy and Stoke's Gareth Snell, have said they won't support this version.Labour's conference policy leaves a new referendum on the table, as an option.Would Jeremy Corbyn give its his full-throated support on 12 December?As things stand - always an important caveat in these tumultuous times - no. The party's emphasis in the run up to the vote won't be on a new referendum, it will be on a ""Brexit That Works For You"" - a customs union with the EU, tariff-free access to the single market and an EU-level of employment rights as a minimum, amongst other things.If the deal is rejected, then Labour will initially do one - or both - of the following:If the prime minister isn't swept from office by her own side, she will again be urged to seek a consensus in Parliament by - above all - erasing her red line on a permanent customs union.And - certainly if the deal is heavily defeated, possibly even if it's narrowly defeated (that hasn't yet been definitively decided) - a confidence motion can be expected.That's the way to trigger the general election that Labour says it wants though, in truth, I have found a lack of enthusiasm in some Labour quarters for this and a wariness amongst some strategists who fear it might help rather than hinder the Conservatives. But Labour policy is to call for an election before considering other options and a confidence motion, even if defeated, ticks that box.There is a cross-party grouping that would favour membership of the European Free Trade Association - countries outside the customs union but allowed to trade freely with the single market in return for accepting its rules - over either a revised deal or another referendum.As I understand it, while a ""People's Vote"" - or public vote to use Labour's terminology - is on Mr Corbyn's table, he is still reluctant to bite.Insiders say they haven't had any inkling that he has become more enthusiastic about the prospect. Leave campaigner Kate Hoey thinks he will keep the option on the table for so long it will ""go off"". And those involved in the campaign for a new referendum haven't had any signals that Mr Corbyn is about to endorse them.Please upgrade your browserTheir hope is that more ""pragmatic"" members of the shadow cabinet - and they include John McDonnell in this - will be able to persuade him, especially given the support of younger left-wing party members for a referendum, if they can't get an election. And I know of a close Corbyn ally who is worried about whether his leader's long-standing internal opponents will be able to ""weaponise"" the Europe issue against him if he doesn't back another vote further down the line.That said, it would be wrong to portray Mr Corbyn as a lone Labour figure trying to push back a referendum tide.There are different shades of opinion in the parliamentary party and there are some (formerly) staunch Remainers who are worried about the risks a new referendum would carry.It has been said to me that it's significant that Diane Abbott is now publicly wary of being seen to want to re-run a referendum. The party's own polling has been showing a slight erosion in support for Remain. The People's Vote campaign, though, would point to polling it has commissioned suggesting the overwhelming majority of members back not only a new vote but staying in the EU. And it would argue it's even more risky for Labour to appear to be sitting on the fence.  Near unity in opposing Theresa May's deal on the Labour benches may start to dissolve after victory on 11 December, rather than after defeat. But Theresa May hasn't lost yet. So here's another important caveat: If a week is a long time in politics these days, a fortnight is an absolute aeon. "
2018-11-28,Reality Check,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46360310,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new window""Sounds like a great deal for the EU,"" is a pretty broad statement. But President Trump was talking in particular about the prospects for future trade agreements. ""Right now, if you look at the (Brexit) deal,"" he said, ""they (the UK) may not be able to trade with us, and that wouldn't be a good thing.""Of course, that shouldn't be taken literally - it doesn't mean no trade at all.But as long as the UK remains in a transition period after Brexit, or in a temporary customs union, it will not be able to implement its own free trade deals, cutting or removing tariffs on goods, with the United States or any other third country.  That much is clear, but trade deals aren't just about tariffs. They are also about rules and regulations (known as non-tariff barriers) which are often more important. And from an ""America-first"" perspective, it's fair to assume that the president thinks Theresa May's Brexit deal makes it more likely that the UK will stay fairly close to the EU in the long term, by following the same (or very similar) regulations in various sectors of the economy.That is a key point. Because the closer the UK stays to the EU's common rules and standards, the more difficult it will be for it to move closer to the rules and standards followed in the United States.  We're talking here not just about examples which come up regularly, such as chlorine-washed chicken or hormone-treated beef (broadly speaking, both are allowed in the US and not in the EU), but also about industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Many big businesses in the UK want to stay close to all those EU rules (its regulatory framework) because the EU is a huge consumer market right on their doorstep.And they tend to follow the EU rules for their global operations because that simply makes things easier. The numbers are also instructive here. Last year the UK exported £274bn of goods and services to the rest of the EU and imported £341bn. The figures for trade with the United States were £112bn of exports and £70bn of imports. So, the EU will remain the UK's most important trading partner for some time to come. And if the president was hoping Brexit would mean a more decisive break between the UK and the EU, he may be disappointed. Hence, ""a great deal for the EU"".There is genuine competition in this field between the United States and the European Union. The EU may not be a military or diplomatic superpower, but it is a regulatory superpower. That means one of the big choices the UK will have to make in its negotiations on post-Brexit trade agreements is which regulatory and legal orbit it chooses to operate in. It's not an absolute ""either-or"" decision, but the UK will have to lean one way or the other. The non-binding political declaration on future UK-EU trade, approved by EU leaders on Sunday, makes this clear. The EU is insisting on various ""level playing field"" conditions to ensure that the UK cannot gain a competitive advantage by continuing to have privileged access to the EU market without following its rules. The political declaration says the level playing field should cover ""state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environmental standards, climate change and relevant tax matters"", and a separate statement issued by the leaders of the EU27 emphasises that they will ""demonstrate particular vigilance"" to ensure that these conditions are followed to the letter.  The declaration also recognises that the UK will develop an independent trade policy in the future. But it stresses that if the goal is to have frictionless trade with the EU, that will depend on how closely aligned the UK remains with the single market and the customs union. We're back to the unresolved argument about the right balance between economic access and sovereignty. So where does that leave the UK's future trade relationship with the US? Downing Street points out that there have already been five working-group meetings to discuss the matter. But this may not be quite the Brexit that Donald Trump had in mind.

2018-11-28,The Brexit guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration.Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on Tuesday, 11 December. If she clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.There are two documents.A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes:The other document is a 26 page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019.The declaration includes:This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs will vote on Tuesday, 11 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that."
2018-11-28,Obituary: Baroness Trumpington,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-43756361,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowShe was the society girl and war-time Nazi codebreaker who fended off the amorous advances of Lloyd-George.In a long political career, she was mayor of Cambridge, a Conservative whip and served as a health minister in Margaret Thatcher's government.But Baroness Trumpington, who has died at the age of 96, found fame and a place in the nation's heart late in life - flicking a V-sign at a colleague during a House of Lords debate.  It was arguably the best career move she ever made and she revelled in her newfound YouTube notoriety.She went from strength to strength, appearing as a no-nonsense panellist on TV programmes like Have I Got News For You - mocking the BBC for requiring her to sign a form to say she was not pregnant in her 90s.She attended debates in the Lords every day until her retirement from public life in 2017, at the age of 95.Even then, she found time to publish her life story, Coming Up Trumps, although she would shyly dismiss the ghost-written memoire.""I don't understand what all the fuss is about,"" she told one reviewer.  ""I didn't write the damn book and  haven't read it either.""Jean Alys Campbell-Harris was born on 28 October 1922.  Her father, Arthur, was a major in the Bengal Lancers and had served as an aide-de-camp to the viceroy of India. Her mother, Doris, was heiress to the fortune of a Chicago paint manufacturer.  The family was brought up in London in considerable privilege.  Her parents moved in a fast set which included the then Prince of Wales, later the Duke of Windsor, and future wife, Wallis Simpson.An army of servants attended to their every need at their huge house in Cumberland Place.  But her parents lost everything when her mother's fortune was wiped out in the 1929 Wall Street Crash. Her parents were forced to downsize and move to rural Kent and a house with no heating or electricity.  The servants were let go with one boy hired to clean the gas lamps.   Jean's playboy father joined his step-father's paint company and worked his way up from the bottom. Her mother pulled in society favours and became a successful interior decorator, roaring between jobs on her pre-WW1 motorbike.Their income meant their reduced circumstances fell short of penury.  ""We used to say my mother's idea of being poor was going to the Ritz on the bus,"" she recalled.  It was not a happy childhood. Jean was a ""daddy's girl"" but he wasn't around much.  The nannies gave her little affection and, later, boarding school was miserable.She was neither academic nor hearty which meant the other girls disliked her.  ""They had crushes on each other and on the games mistress,"" she told one interviewer.  ""I used to go with the local boys to the woods and smoke.""The young Jean was developing an independent spirit that would characterise the rest of her life.She left school at 15 having never sat an exam but fluent in French, German and Italian.  She was good enough at tennis to consider junior Wimbledon but ended up being sent to an equally miserable finishing school in France.As war broke out her parents wondered what to do with her.  The answer was found on a farm owned by the family of the former prime minister, David Lloyd-George, in Surrey.Jean worked as a land-girl and lived, on-site, in a small bungalow alongside Lloyd-George's much younger mistress, and later his wife, Frances Stevenson.  The famously priapic politician - who Jean would always describe as the ""old goat"" - would find reasons to stand her against a wall and measure her with a tape.""I suppose that was the nearest to flesh he could get with Miss Stevenson's beady eye on him,"" she told the Guardian.In 1940, her facility with languages changed her life.  Then 18, she joined the team cracking Nazi codes at ultra-secret Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire.  She worked as a cypher clerk, transcribing messages from German submarines for Alan Turing's codebreakers who worked in complete isolation and with whom they never mixed.The work was ""deeply tedious"" but at weekends she had a ball.  She would hitchhike to London to stay with her friend, the newspaper proprietor and Cabinet minister, Lord Beaverbrook.  Her stentorian voice meant her lifts wisely kept their hands to themselves.Jean would meet friends at the Ritz and Claridge's which were legally required to serve meals for five shillings during wartime.  ""We would throw bread at each other and sing and behave so badly,"" she would reminisce.She was so well-known at the legendary French restaurant, the Bagatelle, that the band would strike up a special tune as soon as she entered the building. The lifestyle was fun but risky.  After one society ball in 1941, she arrived at the Cafe de Paris nightclub in London's West End moments after it was hit by two Luftwaffe bombs.  Thirty-four people were killed and dozens more injured. After the war she was determined to discover her mother's homeland for herself.  She went to America on the Mauretania with £4 in her pocket.Her brother got her a job in an advertising firm on Rockefeller Plaza but it was weeks until she was paid.  She survived on the crisps she found at society parties and by rummaging in the bins behind nightclubs.Jean loved the lifestyle.  The war was over and she was an in-demand party guest famous for dancing on tables.  She fell in love for the first time, to a man she would describe in her memoire only as ""The American"".She would, undoubtedly, have stayed but for the chance meeting with the historian and Eton schoolmaster, Alan Barker.  He had been wounded in Normandy at D-Day and had lost an eye at Monte Casino.  ""He was cosy,"" she said.  ""We just gelled.""When she travelled home to Britain for the Queen's coronation in 1953 he proposed.  She followed him to Cambridge where he had become headmaster of The Leys.  Their son, Adam, was born a year later. The life of a provincial school-teacher's wife suited her.  She adored entertaining the boys to tea.  She had not, however, lost her old rebelliousness.  She smoked, drank, jumped into swimming pools fully clothed and dancing around in a bathing costume to make the students smile for the school photo. Outside school, she partied at Cliveden with the Astors and kept active in Cambridge as a local magistrate.  On one notorious occasion, she had to leave the bench when the serial violent rapist brought before her turned out to be her vegetable delivery man.She was elected as a local councillor in the early 1960s and served as the city's mayor in 1971-72.  Her husband could often be jealous of playing second fiddle on ceremonial occasions so ""I decided not to make him mayoress as I thought that would make that worse"".When, in 1982, Barker suffered a stroke it was her work that kept her sane.  He died a few years later. She sought election to Parliament but was unsuccessful.  Instead, she threw herself into public service in prisons and as UK representative to the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  Her connections with the Conservative leadership eventually saw her appointed to the House of Lords.  She was great friends with Willie Whitelaw and, more importantly, one of the few women who could get on with Margaret Thatcher.Her relations with the prime minister were warm and she claimed this was because she was not afraid to stand up to her.""We got on terribly well. She was very good to me. I owe her everything. I went on the basis that I would be true to myself, say exactly what I felt, and if I got the sack, so what?""She became minister for health in 1985 although she refused to give up her passion for smoking.   John Major kept her on at Agriculture during his administration and she served as baroness-in-waiting to the Queen, which mainly involved meeting foreign dignitaries at airports.Her affection for the Lords ran deep.  Politically, she was a traditionalist - resisting change to the Upper House, campaigning against ""soft"" treatment of criminals and voting against the ban on foxhunting.And, on that famous occasion, gave her colleague Lord King a V-sign when he had the temerity to mention her advancing age during a Remembrance Day debate.  The incident made Lady Trumpington a late-life media personality. She was invited onto Desert Island Discs where she chose the crown jewels as her luxury in order to maximise her chances of rescue.At 90, she became the oldest ever panellist on BBC1's Have I Got News For You although she turned down the offer of a repeat appearance when Margaret Thatcher died because she did not want to poke fun at her political hero and mentor.To the end, Trumpers remained forthright and self-deprecating - putting much of her success down to blind luck.  She also stayed equally determined to enjoy life to the full.   ""I had a fantastic time during the war, doing a job that was very worthwhile, having fun when I went out on the town in the little time off that we were allowed and living life to the full whenever I got the chance.""And I still certainly do."""

It is a calculation made by economists of the most likely thing that will happen in the future, given all the facts available.Historical experience, existing conditions, intended policy - the government approach to Brexit for example - and a variety of possible future events are fed into a computer model which then produces a range of different outcomes.The central forecast is the one that comes in the middle of the most extreme outcomes.In one respect a forecast is a bit like rolling two dice. The most common number you are likely to throw is a seven - that would be the central forecast.Now, you could get two or you could get 12. That doesn't mean that the forecast of seven was wrong, it was just that a more unlikely outcome happened.Forecasts contain what is called a ""distribution"" - that is an upper and lower figure to show a range of possibilities.No, a forecast is more than a roll of the dice, which is random. It's a calculation based on experience, facts, judgement and statistics.On trade, for example, there are plenty of statistics which show the economic effects of more open trade between countries or more barriers to trade.A forecast is an attempt to use past events to predict the future (not always with complete precision) and is seen as useful in showing a direction of travel - better for the economy or worse - given what we know historically.

2018-11-28,An impossible task for PM?,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46352461,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowIf you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home.How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance?Has she finally met her impossible task?In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something.And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too.Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union.......or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU......or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town.And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too.And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line.It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try.We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go."

2018-11-28,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."
2018-11-28,Brexit: All you need to know,https://web.archive.org//web/20181129061959/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-32810887,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowHere is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent. It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which will take place on 11 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs are expected to vote on the deal on 12 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

What will she do if she can't get her vote through? Is there a plan B? Could there be a Norway-style relationship with the EU? Could there be another referendum?Westminster's awash with speculation and gossip about what might happen next if her Brexit compromise is killed off by her colleagues.

Nobody's going to allow no deal. How could we?"" At the summit, Mrs May will highlight her plans to strike a free trade agreement with the EU.She is expected to tell world leaders: ""International firms that have invested in UK production or use European bases to supply the UK market will benefit from these arrangements.""But she will add: ""For the first time in more than four decades, the UK will have an independent trade policy. ""We will play a full and active role on trade on the global stage, working with friends new and old, at a time of unprecedented global inter-connectedness.""The summit comes after President Trump suggested that the negotiated deal could threaten any future US-UK trade deal.Mrs May is the first serving UK prime minister to visit the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, and the second to travel to the country, after Tony Blair in 2001.The Falkland Islands - still claimed by Argentina, 36 years after the 1982 war with Britain - is likely to be discussed at a meeting Mrs May has with the country's president, Mauricio Macri, during the gathering, although the main focus of their talks will trade.Mrs May said: ""I am clear that our position on the sovereignty of the Falklands has not changed. What has changed in recent months is we have seen better relations with Argentina.""In the UK, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox is to defend Mrs May's deal, saying that while it will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make.In a speech at the Portbury Royal Docks, near Bristol, Mr Fox, who campaigned for Brexit, will also play down reports suggesting that UK economic growth after Brexit would be slower than if the UK stayed in the EU.""The deal we've reached will give us a firm and stable base on which to leave the EU and build this country's global future, a future that still encompasses Europe, of course, but also the wide fast-growing markets beyond, with all the opportunity that entails.""

But Labour sources say the party has not yet agreed to take part, with Jeremy Corbyn telling This Morning he preferred ITV's offer.The BBC said it was ""delighted"" Mrs May had accepted the offer.It added it would discuss debate formats with both parties and would announce further details soon.Mr Corbyn claimed he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening - 9 December. ""I want to watch it myself,"" he said.When approached by the BBC, ITV confirmed the final of the show would air at 21:00 GMT.It is understood the BBC debate programme would start at 20:00 in Birmingham, after Strictly Come Dancing and replacing David Attenborough's Dynasties on BBC One.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May had accepted this offer ""because there was a view on the government's side that the BBC would address the crux of the issue, namely the deal"".By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonRecent history tells us TV debates involving politicians are long in the gestation, and painful in labour.Welcome to 2018's anticipated arrival.The BBC announces Theresa May has agreed to a debate  - but there is a snag. Jeremy Corbyn hasn't said he will turn up. He would rather go on ITV.And so starts the posturing among the telly luvvies along the lines of ""my audience is bigger than yours"".There are other awkward questions for the broadcasters too: where is the passionate Brexiteer voice? Where is the advocate of another referendum?Because even if Mr Corbyn accepts, the two biggest names on the programme wouldn't be a million miles apart on the fundamentals.It would be a discussion between two people who voted Remain and are committed to delivering Brexit, talking to an audience that doesn't have a say on what happens next.Oh and one last thought: this TV show, involving both of them, still might not happen.If this or any Brexit TV debate goes ahead without all options - including that of remaining in the EU - being included and given a voice, it will be an absolute travesty of democracy. @BBCNewsPR https://t.co/Na7A01CQQkEnd of Twitter post  by @NicolaSturgeonMrs May previously rejected calls for smaller political parties to take part in the debate, saying she and Mr Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them.However, it is understood the BBC's proposed debate format would include a range of parties and opinions. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involved.Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that the debate should include dialogue ""about all possible routes forward"" - including another referendum.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable - who has also campaigned for another referendum - said he was ""raring and willing to go"" in the TV debate, adding it would be a ""travesty"" if only Mrs May and Mr Corbyn were involved.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his party had been ""sidelined throughout the Brexit process"" and their omission from any debate would perpetuate that problem.Further referendum campaign People's Vote, meanwhile, said it had written to both the BBC and broadcasting regulator Ofcom regarding the proposed format of the debate.The group said that, while other views may be represented as part of a panel, it ""would not be acceptable to us if they were relegated to a sideshow away from the main debate between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn"".  Ahead of the 2017 general election, Mrs May refused to take part in televised debates, with then home secretary Amber Rudd standing in for her on the BBC's programme.The prime minister is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December."

Jeremy Corbyn later told ITV that MPs would not allow a no-deal Brexit. The Labour leader said: ""The alternative isn't no deal. Nobody's going to allow no deal. How could we?"" Labour is hoping to force a general election or, failing that, another referendum, if, as is currently widely expected, MPs reject Mrs May's deal.Mrs May was questioned by the Commons liaison committee, made up of the chairs of all select committees.She refused to speculate about what she would do if MPs reject her Brexit deal on 11 December, saying she wanted MPs to ""focus on the choice that lies in front of them"" and ignore other potential options.She also described calls for another referendum or delaying 29 March's departure date as attempts to ""frustrate"" Brexit.Mrs May told the committee the only deal on offer was the one she had negotiated with the EU.""This is an important point in our history. It is a vote on which we will be deciding whether we deliver on the decision of the British people,"" she told the MPs.""What has been made clear from the European Union is that this is the deal that has been negotiated and this is the deal that people need to focus on when they are looking at the vote.""She faced repeated calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit but declined to do so.When Labour MP Rachel Reeves put it to her that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"", Mrs May said the UK was leaving the EU in March 2019 and said she was promoting ""a good deal"": She said: ""When we come to the vote... it will be for Parliamentarians to determine whether they want to deliver on the vote that the British people took, whether they want to do that with a good deal - which actually does protect people's jobs into the future.""She added: ""If the House were to vote down the deal that that has been agreed, given that the European Union has been clear this this is the deal that has been agreed... then obviously decisions would have to be taken in relation to the actions that would need to be taken.""Conservative Sir Bernard Jenkin questioned the Bank of England report and government analysis of Brexit's economic impact, suggesting they were ""rubbish"". Asked by Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston about fears of medicine shortages and other impacts on the NHS of a no-deal Brexit, the PM said: ""If anybody is concerned about these matters it is another reason to focus on the deal.""She claimed delaying Brexit for another referendum would lead to the re-opening of negotiations with the EU, something she said Brussels had ruled out. But the main reason she was against another referendum, she told MPs, was that it would destroy trust in politics and lead to ""more uncertainty and more division in this country"".Labour has tabled an amendment to the vote on 11 December calling on MPs to reject Mrs May's ""bad"" Brexit deal.It also calls on MPs to prevent ""the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal"" and to ""keep all options on the table to protect the UK from a no deal scenario, with a general election as the best outcome for the country"".If Labour fails to get MPs' backing for its Brexit proposals or a general election the party has said it will seek support for another referendum.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is to make a statement to MPs on Monday, on his legal advice to the government on its EU withdrawal agreement, ahead of five days of debate on the Brexit deal.Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, told MPs: ""The binding motion that was passed was for nothing less than the full and final legal advice provided by the attorney general, so it is wholly unacceptable, and frankly shows contempt for this House."" Earlier Mr Corbyn told ITV's mid-morning chat show Mrs May would lose 11 December's vote but ""nobody is going to allow no-deal"".The Labour leader said his focus was on forcing a general election - and he conceded that it might take ""some time"" for an incoming Labour government to negotiate a fresh Brexit deal with Brussels - possibly up to two years.He refused to say how he would vote if there was another EU referendum, saying: ""It depends what the questions are.""He had agreed to ITV's proposal for a TV debate ahead of the Commons vote, he told host Philip Schofield, before Downing Street said Mrs May had agreed to take part in a debate on the BBC. He also revealed that he had some sympathy for Mrs May because ""leadership is a lonely place and that can be difficult"".Does @jeremycorbyn feel sympathy with the Prime Minister?'Yes, at a human level ... but actually I have far more sympathy with people in our country that are going through terrible stress' #ThisMorning pic.twitter.com/Ha4BldAr8yEnd of Twitter post  by @thismorningIs #Brexit backstop like a ""post-war prefab"" asks Conservative MP Andrew Murrison - ""sold as temporary, built to last, and likely to outlive us all?""Theresa May: ""No... neither side thinks that the backstop is a good place to be in""More: https://t.co/dOtsa0cnYi pic.twitter.com/GEcS9eT8o3End of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsThe EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said Mrs May's Brexit plan ""is the only possible deal"".He told the European Parliament: ""We are not at the end of the process, which is going to go on being difficult.""

Conservative MP Julian Lewis, who chairs the defence committee, repeatedly asked the PM under what circumstances a hard Irish border would be erected.Theresa May said ministers would do ""everything in our power"" to avoid a hard border, and emphasised that she could not speak for the Irish government.Conservative MP Andrew Murrison asked if Mrs May's arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party that keeps her in power was still in place, given that the DUP last week abstained on votes in protest at the EU withdrawal deal.Mrs May said the confidence and supply agreement with the party ""remains in place"".She added that she had had talks about the DUP's ""concerns"", but expected them to continue to support the government in the long run.The SNP's Pete Wishart said Scotland would be worse off under the PM's proposed Brexit deal and ""now is not the time"" to ""make us poorer"".Mrs May said her deal has the support of ""employers and organisations in Scotland""."

They want to amend the ""meaningful vote"" motion to rule out ""no deal"". The BBC understands Conservative, Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green politicians are involved. MPs are due to vote on the prime minister's Brexit agreement with the EU on 11 December.Theresa May has repeatedly said voting the deal down would risk a ""no-deal"" Brexit. But amendments being discussed in Westminster would seek to rule that out. Several sources told the BBC they think such an amendment is the only one that could command a majority. It would not be legally binding, but a source said if MPs back the amendment it would be a clear ""expression of parliamentary opinion"".Another source says it would ""knock out"" leaving the EU without a deal as a realistic option.A third source said there was a ""growing consensus"" against a ""no-deal"" Brexit. Up to six amendments will be voted on when MPs pass judgement on the prime minister's Brexit deal.One has already been tabled by chairman of the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn, which would rule out no deal and allow MPs to give the government instruction on how to act. That has been backed by Conservatives Dominic Grieve and Sarah Wollaston, as well as Labour's Meg Hillier, Yvette Cooper and Rachel Reeves. Separately Labour's front bench has tabled an amendment saying that the party cannot support the agreement, as it fails to provide for a customs union and ""strong single market"" deal. It also says it opposes a no deal withdrawal, and ""resolves to pursue every option"" that prevents such a scenario.There is also likely to be a front bench amendment from the SNP. Some in Parliament think they are unlikely to pass but they hope a cross-party effort will be seen as less partisan and will have more chance of achieving a majority.The amendments will be selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow, on 11 December - the last of five days of debate on the Brexit agreement."

Figures show net migration - the difference between how many people came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left - was 273,000 last year.EU net migration was 74,000 in the year to the end of June 2018, while non-EU net migration was 248,000.The ONS said more Asian citizens had been moving to the UK for work.The Office for National Statistics says 219,000 EU citizens arrived in the UK, as 145,000 left, making net EU migration the lowest it had been since 2012.The data also showed non-EU net migration was the highest since 2004.Jay Lindop, director of the ONS's centre for international migration, said overall net migration had peaked in 2016 and remained fairly stable since then.Overall net migration takes into account the migration of British citizens, of which 49,000 more left the country than returned in the year to the end of June 2018.In the year to the end of June 2017, EU net migration was 107,000 and non-EU net migration was 173,000. Overall net migration was 273,000 in the same period.The government's policy is to reduce overall migration to below 100,000 a year.Separately, the Home Office has released statistics on the number of British citizenship applications, which show the number of EU nationals applying has increased by almost a third over the past year.There were 43,545 requests in the 12 months to the end of September - a rise of 32% on last year."
2018-11-29,DUP accuses No 10 of 'hiding' over Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181130063013/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-46387527,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe DUP has accused the government of having ""something to hide"" by not publishing the full legal advice it has received on the Brexit deal.During an urgent question in the Commons, the solicitor general said the government would publish a ""full reasoned statement"" soon.The attorney general will also answer MPs' questions in Parliament on Monday.But the DUP's deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the Commons had already rejected the government's offer.He said ministers were simply repeating the proposal that was made during a debate on the motion earlier this month.The DUP's MPs supported that motion - despite the confidence-and-supply arrangement it shares with the government.Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Dodds said: ""Why doesn't the solicitor general and the government start listening? That has been the problem all along.""""What has the government got to hide?""Solicitor General Robert Buckland denied the claim, adding: ""This is not an instance where the government seeks to delay or hide, this is about providing information at the right time.""A number of other MPs have expressed concerns that they will not be able to go through the legal advice in time before the vote on the government's Brexit deal.The DUP has said Theresa May's Brexit plan is ""worse than no deal"", and has vowed to vote against it when the meaningful vote takes place on 11 December.It has put a question mark over the future of the confidence-and-supply deal with the Conservative Party.The Conservative Party entered into the pact with the DUP after the general election in 2017, in order to give the prime minister a working majority in the Commons.The DUP agreed to support the government on all Brexit votes, finance bills and the Budget and a number of other areas in exchange for an extra £1bn in spending for Northern Ireland.But the fallout over Brexit has put the parties' relationship under significant strain - with the DUP abstaining and voting against the government last week during a budget vote, in a bid to warn the government to change course on Brexit.Northern Ireland was the main sticking point in the Brexit negotiations, as the UK and EU were at odds over how to ensure no hard border - physical checks or infrastructure - between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit.Both sides have said they hope to ensure a solution is found as part of a wider trade deal, which keeps trade as frictionless as it is now.But in the absence of that, the EU wanted an insurance policy in the legally binding withdrawal agreement: the backstop.The agreement on the backstop would see only Northern Ireland stay aligned to some EU rules, if it took effect.That means some goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain would face extra checks to see if they met EU standards.But the UK government and EU insist it is only an insurance policy in the event that there is no breakthrough by the end of the transition period.The DUP has always said its one red line was the backstop.It is concerned that the backstop could threaten the integrity of the union by placing a trade border down the Irish Sea.The party's leader Arlene Foster has insisted there is still time to work for a ""better deal"" and has criticised Theresa May for ""wasting time"" trying to build support for the plan, when it is unlikely to get enough support from MPs in a matter of weeks.The prime minister visited Northern Ireland on Tuesday as part of her two-week push to sell her agreement. She has urged the DUP to ""think about the national interest"" when considering her Brexit deal.On Thursday, Mrs May appeared before a Westminster committee to answer questions about the government's plan.Is #Brexit backstop like a ""post-war prefab"" asks Conservative MP Andrew Murrison - ""sold as temporary, built to last, and likely to outlive us all?""Theresa May: ""No... neither side thinks that the backstop is a good place to be in""More: https://t.co/dOtsa0cnYi pic.twitter.com/GEcS9eT8o3End of Twitter post  by @BBCPoliticsShe was asked if she will still have the support of the DUP if her deal is voted through Parliament, to which Mrs May did not directly answer the question, but said: ""They have said themselves that the confidence and supply arrangement remains in place.""She also warned that political declarations are ""not guarantees"" when it comes to avoiding a hard border if her Brexit deal is rejected, and faced tough questioning from other MPs about the Northern Ireland backstop.

In a speech to law enforcement leaders, he said close co-operation  was the ""heart of effective security"". Mr Wallace said the PM's deal, which MPs vote on next month, would set the foundations for the most comprehensive security relationship in EU history.But Labour's Diane Abbott said the plan ""failed on guarantees for security"". The shadow home secretary's party is to table an amendment to reject the deal  but also ""prevent the chaos of the UK crashing out of the EU"".The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but, under Theresa May's deal, there would then be a transition period, during which the UK and EU would continue to work together as they do now.The deal for how the UK will leave the EU is accompanied by a non-binding declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK after transition has ended, which includes the promise to co-operate on security.MPs are due to vote on the deal on 11 December. If they reject it - and no other solution is found - the UK could leave without a deal. The current arrangements on security co-operation would then end on 29 March with nothing to replace them.In the run-up to the vote, the public can expect a steady drumbeat of official warnings about the dangers of a no-deal Brexit, says BBC political reporter Brian Wheeler, as Mrs May and her team try to sell her plan.A leaked copy of Downing Street's own timetable for media announcements has ""security"" listed as a Thursday priority with ""international trade"" scheduled the following day.Please upgrade your browserMr Wallace was speaking at the International Security Expo in London, where he said that such a no-deal departure would be a step backwards for security co-operation. He added that the UK, through the experience of the last few decades, had learnt the value of working with its European partners.He said: ""We and Europe know, from bitter experience, that often when there is a mistake or when something has been missed that we find, time and time again, that it has been due to a failure of co-operation.""A no-deal situation would have a real impact on our ability to work with our European partners to protect the public.""By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent The UK wants to maintain all the existing security arrangements - and it knows that the EU wants to maintain this high level of co-operation out of mutual self-interest. But there are problems. Critics of the government's hopes for post-Brexit security are concerned that the proposed final relationship with the EU - that would kick in in 2021 - is long on aspirations but short on solutions.It's not remotely clear if the UK will be able to access EU-organised databases, such as those that exchange criminal records, wanted alerts and DNA and fingerprint records, after the transition. Once transition ends, so does access to the data - unless a security treaty can be agreed. But even if that treaty is signed, it may come up short. Some nations, like Germany, have constitutional bars on how they can co-operate on security with non EU states.  In his address, Mr Wallace said that Mrs May's agreement would set the foundations for the broadest security relationship the EU has had with another country. The partnership would include the ability to exchange information on criminals and tackle terrorism, to quickly share data on people travelling to and from the UK to spot potential threats, to exchange DNA and fingerprints, and to fast-track extraditions.Ms Abbott described the government plans as ""dangerously flimsy"". She said: ""There is no new security treaty on offer, which is vital for cross-border policing arrangements, especially extradition.""She added that there were ""only aspirations for a vague security partnership, no plans for proper security arrangements, including with Europol"" and that it was ""simply unacceptable"". As the vote on the PM's deal draws closer, details of what will happen in Parliament during the build up were released. The Commons will debate the agreement for eight hours a day on 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 December under business proposals set out by the government.But MPs will be allowed to table six amendments to the Brexit motion, to be chosen by the Speaker of the House of Commons and heard before the vote on 11 December. Labour has put forward an amendment ""rejecting Theresa May's botched Brexit deal"" and to stop a no-deal, calling for all options to be left on the table if it gets voted down. The party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said the deal ""is a miserable failure of negotiation by a government that has wasted the last two years fighting with itself, rather than securing a better deal with the EU"".Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis called the amendment ""shameful and irresponsible behaviour"", adding: ""All they are interested in is trying to force a general election."""

""All the industries, all the infrastructure of the country, are they all ready at this point in time? And, as best as we can tell, the answer is no,"" Mr Carney said.It is in the interests of the country that there should be a transition to whatever new relationship the UK has with the EU, he said.He added: ""We know issues around the borders, we go to the ports and we know the issues that are there today. So we need some time to get ready for it.""On Wednesday, MPs warned that there was a ""real prospect"" of ""major disruption"" at UK ports in the case of a no-deal Brexit, with government plans ""worryingly under-developed"".However, the Department for Transport said the Public Accounts Committee's conclusions ""were not accurate"".Conservative MP and Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mark Carney of talking down the pound on Wednesday, saying the Bank of England's warnings tonight ""lack all credibility"".Mr Rees-Mogg said ""project fear"" had become ""project hysteria"".""The overwhelming majority - 87% - of British companies do not trade with the European Union,"" he said.""It will not have an effect on them. Leaving the European Union is a real economic opportunity and it's an opportunity that neither the Bank of England nor the Treasury in its forecasts wishes to recognise,"" Mr Rees-Mogg added.Mr Carney's comments come after government forecasts warned that the UK would be economically poorer under any form of Brexit, compared with staying in the EU.Under Theresa May's Chequers Brexit plan, the UK economy could be up to 3.9% smaller after 15 years compared with staying in the EU, government analysis suggested.With a no-deal Brexit, the hit to the economy would be 9.3%.""Our deal is the best deal available for jobs and our economy, that allows us to honour the referendum and realise the opportunities of Brexit,"" Mrs May said at Prime Minister's Questions.The Bank of England, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that the UK economy could shrink by 8% in the immediate aftermath of Brexit if there was no transition period, house prices could fall by almost a third, and that the pound could fall by a quarter.The UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has said the risks of the draft Brexit agreement were ""preferable to the risks of a no-deal scenario"".""Leaving the EU creates a number of risks for us regardless of the form of exit,"" the FCA said in a report.""The implementation period helps address these at the cost of a lower ability to influence regulation during that period. An exit without agreement would carry much higher risk and carry significant uncertainty for us and for firms.""Against that background, and viewed through the lens of our statutory objectives, the draft Withdrawal Agreement and the outline political declaration are preferable steps.""The FCA was asked by the Treasury Select Committee to consider the impact of Brexit in three areas: a no-deal scenario; the draft withdrawal agreement; and the outline political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and UK.In a letter to the committee's chairman, Nicky Morgan, FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey said a no-deal scenario ""would create significant challenges and risks in terms of firms' readiness, potential market disruption and insufficient public-policy solutions put in place on the side of the EU""."

It's difficult to judge each stage, but that's the sequence I think that we'll inevitably go through over this period.""Asked by Laura Kuenssberg if a vote of no confidence did not bring down the government and lead to a general election, a second referendum was ""inevitable"", Mr McDonnell replied: ""That's right. ""Our policy is if we can't get a general election, then the other option which we've kept on the table is a people's vote.""Asked about shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's claim that the Leave side could win another referendum, he said: ""It might do. It's very difficult to call at the moment.""He said most of the Labour MPs campaigning for another referendum were the ""strongest Remainers"".""So, the caution for them and for all of us, whichever argument you put, is the people will decide. As we saw in the last referendum, it's very difficult to predict which way the people will decide on this. ""I've seen a lot of polls that have said there has been a shift from Leave to Remain. I've also seen other polls saying actually we're just about the same as we were then.""He said he had voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum and he believed it was still the ""best option"" but he also respected ""the wishes of the people"".If there were to be another referendum, he said, there would be a ""debate"" in the Labour Party about its position but it could not support Theresa May's ""current"" deal, if that were on the ballot paper.Prime Minister Theresa May, who is Conservative Party leader, said that Mr McDonnell's comments about another referendum showed that ""the true Labour position"" was that they want to ""frustrate Brexit"".Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister said another referendum would be a ""betrayal of the vote of the British people"" adding that the Government had negotiated a deal that ""delivers Brexit"" while ""protecting jobs, protecting livelihoods, protecting security and protecting our United Kingdom"".A fresh referendum could be held only if the government legislates for one and a majority in the Commons supports it.Theresa May has faced repeated calls to hold another referendum from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Green and a small number of Conservative MPs, who are members of the People's Vote campaign, but has always rejected them.Under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, introduced in 2011 by David Cameron's coalition government, a general election can be called if two-thirds of MPs vote for one.Alternatively, if a majority of MPs back a no-confidence vote in the prime minister, a 14-day period is allowed for a new government to be formed with the approval of MPs. If no such vote is passed, a new election must be held."

However, at this point, the prime minister's deal seems to have only further entrenched Tory battle lines against her. The number of Conservative MPs against the deal currently floats at around 93, according to the latest BBC tally. This only includes those who have explicitly stated they don't support it. Total opposition, including Tory MPs who have yet to publicly declare their position, is said to be well over 100. There are 315 Tory MPs in Parliament - not counting two who are currently suspended - and they have splintered off into a bewildering array of factions over Brexit.Here's a guide to the different groups.They're advocating, and have long advocated, leaving the EU without a deal in place, or on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, and have categorically ruled out supporting the prime minister's deal. Made up of the most fervent and veteran Brexit supporters within the European Research Group, the Eurosceptic think tank headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, these MPs view achieving their version of Brexit as more important than keeping Theresa May in No 10.Some, arguably, think it is even more important than keeping the Conservatives in government - although chances are you probably won't hear them admitting this publicly (the Democratic Unionist Party, who keep Mrs May in power, have recently hinted at this, if it means the deal's proposals for Northern Ireland can be ditched). They are only a handful in number, but given Mrs May's increasingly slim parliamentary majority - with the DUP also opposed to her deal - this troublesome tribe could prove numerous enough to sink her deal.This group thinks there is no longer enough time to realistically achieve a renegotiation of the deal on offer before the legislated exit day of 29 March 2019, as well as believing the prime minister has used up all her bargaining power and political capital in Brussels and has reached the point of no return, or, as numerous EU leaders stated last weekend: ""This is it."" These Conservatives argue that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK would leave the EU on WTO trading terms - is better than the deal Mrs May has put on the table and the only option left in the face of what they view as an inevitable defeat in parliament. Some cabinet ministers are rumoured to be quietly making the argument for a ""negotiated no deal"", whereby the UK's EU membership would be extended to allow the government to better prepare for leaving without a deal.According to Article 50 rules, leaving without a deal is technically the default option for the UK should a deal not be reached, bar a change in government. But despite this small group of advocates, a no-deal Brexit is not likely to get a majority of MPs in Parliament behind it. Many MPs have vowed to find a way to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"", should the prime minister's deal be defeated in parliament.  Vocally-supported by the likes of Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who both resigned in July over Mrs May's Chequers blueprint, this group of mostly European Research Group members have been arguing for a Canada-style free trade agreement (also known as ""Canada +++"" or ""Super Canada"" in some circles) for some time. Some MPs who previously resided in this tribe have broken off to align themselves with the aforementioned No Dealers faction. Some at this point may be in favour of extending Article 50 in order to make room for renegotiation, despite extension being a previous red line for many in this group.  The group recently set out their vision for the UK again in a document entitled ""Your Right to Know: the case against Chequers and the draft Withdrawal Agreement in plain English"". They claim a Canada-type deal - whereby the UK would be out of the single market and customs union, with no tariffs or quotas on any imports and exports between the UK and EU - is a ""superior alternative"" to the prime minister's deal. Mrs May claims their solution fails to adequately solve the Irish border question in that the plan would create a hard border. Many, if not all, in this group also have strong objections to the Irish backstop, and insist on it being binned in favour of no backstop at all. Tory backbencher Nick Boles has branded their proposal a ""Fantastic Beast of Johnsonian Folklore"". Mr Boles is among those Conservatives arguing for a Norway-style Brexit instead.The so-called ""Norway Plus"" option would see the UK retaining membership of the customs union and full access to the single market - meaning freedom of movement and the payments to the EU for market access the prime minister wants to end would likely continue. But Norway's advocates say we'd be outside the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and outside the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  Current EFTA members include Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.This proposal has evolved since it was first put forward, when it said the UK should gain (or regain; we left in 1972 when we joined the EEC, under Edward Heath) temporary membership of EFTA for a few years until we negotiate a strong free trade deal. However, the consensus in European diplomatic circles is that current members as well as the EU would be against temporary UK membership of the bloc. Now, Norway is being pitched as an indefinite solution to a deal that looks likely to die on the doorstep of Parliament. Conservatives such as George Freeman are claiming this proposal enjoys cross-party support and is ""the only sensible way to deliver the EU referendum result"". Indeed, it's rumoured some cabinet ministers are willing to get on board with this option if the draft agreement falls in the Commons.The Conservatives who openly support the prime minister's deal are mainly made up of loyal government ministers. The trouble is, there currently still aren't enough of them to get the prime minister's deal through Parliament - and there's still no ruling out even more ministerial resignations than we've already seen in between now and voting day.Then there are the pragmatic backbenchers (see below for another breed of pragmatists who openly criticise the deal). This group would normally make up a large, silent majority chunk in the middle of the party, shielding themselves from the din of ardent Leavers and Remainers. They're normally loyal to party policy and vote accordingly on Brexit matters. However, Theresa May's deal has melted away support even from this tribe, who were in fact dangerously shaky in numbers even before the deal was unveiled thanks to the Conservatives' lack of a working majority.Though clear in their opposition to the prime minister's deal, not all Conservatives are giving up on it altogether. The bulk of this tribe are made up of MPs who have serious concerns about the backstop proposals for Northern Ireland. Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, has emphasised the extent to which the backstop remains a sticking point with many backbenchers: ""It is interesting the number of Conservative MPs that like me will swallow everything else they are not happy with, and may be persuaded.""But the issue of part of the country being treated different to the rest is something many of us find completely unacceptable.""This group also includes the DUP, with leader Arlene Foster insisting that Theresa May can find ""a third way, a better way"". However, other recent comments by Ms Foster, suggesting a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is preferable to the prime minister's deal, would relocate the Northern Irish party into a far more extreme tribe than this one.Others have pointed to what they see as the positives in May's deal, such as ending freedom of movement and shielding the UK economy from the uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. Some also stress that there is room for more manoeuvre on the details of the future relationship. But these upsides have so far failed to surmount other concerns, such as those surrounding aspects of the transition period, the role of the European Court of Justice and the £39bn ""divorce payment"". These are the Conservatives who despite their distaste for the deal, are supporting it through gritted teeth. It could be that many of these are choosing not to publicly state their position either way as of yet, but will begrudgingly cast their vote in favour when it comes to the day due to a lack of other options. Theresa May will certainly be hoping this group increases in number in the coming weeks, as it seems clear that winning over direct converts from either side in large numbers is unlikely. Lead pragmatist Nicky Morgan, previously of the Norway tribe, has called on MPs to discard their ""entrenched positions"" and back the prime minister. Ken Clarke dubbed the deal ""a bit of a dog's breakfast"", but has vowed to support it regardless - despite being a veteran Remainer.This tribe would probably have viewed any deal as worse than staying in the EU. Many privately support another referendum, but have yet to join the handful of Tory MPs who openly back the People's Vote campaign, alongside the likes of Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. If the prime minister's deal is rejected, a large group of MPs currently keeping quiet could come out to publicly support another referendum, aligning themselves with many Labour MPs. Other parts of the tribe are hoping an EU Supreme Court ruling will see the UK being able to unilaterally revoke Article 50, potentially paving the way to cancel Brexit altogether. After Jo Johnson's recent resignation as a government minister and support for this option, the People's Vote campaign has received a Tory boost. This option is being sold as the only way to solve the current impasse in Parliament. These Tories also campaign across party lines and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Labour MPs such as Chuka Ummuna. The People's Vote campaign's march in Westminster recently attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters. The campaign also has the support of former Prime Minister John Major, who told the BBC as early as July that the case for another referendum was ""morally justified"". Leading campaigner Anna Soubry told the BBC: ""The best deal we have with the EU is the current deal…people are realising our country has made a terrible mistake."" "

2018-11-29,Five key questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20181130063013/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46350966,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS.From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions.The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more.The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port.The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs.Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry.Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs.He even suggested the public may have to stockpile drugs themselves.The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse.Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"".The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe.The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas.But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least £30,000 a year.There are other related factors too.The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK.That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service.The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training.About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved.And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care.Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU.They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that.The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments.The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them.Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance.Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU.The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research.The government is also increasing its spending on research and development.Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK.The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services.The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn.Its report found migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it.The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said.The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10.It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra £350m a week could be spent on the NHS.The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by £20bn by 2023.On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK.That amounts to more than the promised £350m a week.Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"".Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the £39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise.The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed.Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards?Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed.  "
2018-11-29,Labour and Brexit,https://web.archive.org//web/20181130063013/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46365397,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowLabour is determined to defeat Theresa May when the so called 'meaningful vote' on the Brexit deal is held next month. It looks like they will get some help to do so from at least some of the prime minister's own MPs.And with at least a suspicion that Theresa May could try to get her deal - or something awfully close to it - through at the second attempt, Labour waverers don't seem to have much incentive to break ranks on 11 December.This would risk the ire of party members and very possibly still not deliver enough votes for the deal to pass.Indeed some of those Labour politicians from Leave areas who had mulled over backing a government-brokered deal, such as Wigan's Lisa Nandy and Stoke's Gareth Snell, have said they won't support this version.Labour's conference policy leaves a new referendum on the table, as an option.Would Jeremy Corbyn give its his full-throated support on 12 December?As things stand - always an important caveat in these tumultuous times - no. The party's emphasis in the run up to the vote won't be on a new referendum, it will be on a ""Brexit That Works For You"" - a customs union with the EU, tariff-free access to the single market and an EU-level of employment rights as a minimum, amongst other things.If the deal is rejected, then Labour will initially do one - or both - of the following:If the prime minister isn't swept from office by her own side, she will again be urged to seek a consensus in Parliament by - above all - erasing her red line on a permanent customs union.And - certainly if the deal is heavily defeated, possibly even if it's narrowly defeated (that hasn't yet been definitively decided) - a confidence motion can be expected.That's the way to trigger the general election that Labour says it wants though, in truth, I have found a lack of enthusiasm in some Labour quarters for this and a wariness amongst some strategists who fear it might help rather than hinder the Conservatives. But Labour policy is to call for an election before considering other options and a confidence motion, even if defeated, ticks that box.There is a cross-party grouping that would favour membership of the European Free Trade Association - countries outside the customs union but allowed to trade freely with the single market in return for accepting its rules - over either a revised deal or another referendum.As I understand it, while a ""People's Vote"" - or public vote to use Labour's terminology - is on Mr Corbyn's table, he is still reluctant to bite.Insiders say they haven't had any inkling that he has become more enthusiastic about the prospect. Leave campaigner Kate Hoey thinks he will keep the option on the table for so long it will ""go off"". And those involved in the campaign for a new referendum haven't had any signals that Mr Corbyn is about to endorse them.Please upgrade your browserTheir hope is that more ""pragmatic"" members of the shadow cabinet - and they include John McDonnell in this - will be able to persuade him, especially given the support of younger left-wing party members for a referendum, if they can't get an election. And I know of a close Corbyn ally who is worried about whether his leader's long-standing internal opponents will be able to ""weaponise"" the Europe issue against him if he doesn't back another vote further down the line.That said, it would be wrong to portray Mr Corbyn as a lone Labour figure trying to push back a referendum tide.There are different shades of opinion in the parliamentary party and there are some (formerly) staunch Remainers who are worried about the risks a new referendum would carry.It has been said to me that it's significant that Diane Abbott is now publicly wary of being seen to want to re-run a referendum. The party's own polling has been showing a slight erosion in support for Remain. The People's Vote campaign, though, would point to polling it has commissioned suggesting the overwhelming majority of members back not only a new vote but staying in the EU. And it would argue it's even more risky for Labour to appear to be sitting on the fence.  Near unity in opposing Theresa May's deal on the Labour benches may start to dissolve after victory on 11 December, rather than after defeat. But Theresa May hasn't lost yet. So here's another important caveat: If a week is a long time in politics these days, a fortnight is an absolute aeon. "
2018-11-29,The Brexit guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20181130063013/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration.Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on Tuesday, 11 December. If she clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.There are two documents.A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes:The other document is a 26 page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019.The declaration includes:This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs will vote on Tuesday, 11 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that."

2018-11-29,Party conferences 2018: At-a-glance,https://web.archive.org//web/20181130063013/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45704792,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowThe autumn party conference season is over for another year.Here are the highlights from the past six weeks, as Britain's political parties gathered together to debate issues, decide policy and to socialise. Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which will take place on 11 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead.

There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."

2018-11-30,May not ruling out second MPs' Brexit vote,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46394431,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has refused to rule out another Commons vote on her Brexit deal if MPs reject it the first time.The PM said she thought she could win the vote on 11 December despite dozens of Tory MPs being against the deal.In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, she urged MPs to ""deliver on the vote of the referendum"".EU Council President Donald Tusk warned if MPs rejected the deal, the UK would face a choice between leaving without a deal or not leaving at all. Under Commons rules, the prime minister is not meant to ask MPs the same question twice - she would have to change the contents of her deal.Alternatively, if enough MPs indicate they have changed their minds after voting the deal down, it could be held again, but it would be up to the Speaker to decide whether to allow that.Pressed by Laura Kuenssberg on whether she would attempt to hold another vote, Mrs May - who is in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for a G20 summit of world leaders - said: ""I'm focused on the vote that is taking place on 11 December and I want everybody who's going to participate, all members of Parliament, to focus on what this vote does.""Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he did not now expect any Labour MPs to vote for Mrs May's deal, telling Talk Radio he thinks the party will ""hold together"". The Labour leadership has said it is ready to support a cross-party amendment to the vote that would explicitly rule out a no-deal. The amendment would not be binding but it would be hard for the PM to ignore it, if it is passed by Parliament.European Council President Donald Tusk, meanwhile, has stressed that the deal the EU struck with Theresa May was the ""only possible one"".He said: ""If this deal is rejected in the Commons, we are left with, as was stressed a few weeks ago from Prime Minister May, an alternative - no deal or no Brexit at all.""But a senior UK official said: ""Right from the very outset, Donald Tusk has not hidden the fact that he finds (Brexit) a moment of sadness for himself and for the EU.""But the prime minister has always been very clear to President Tusk that we are leaving on 29 March next year.""The BBC's Europe Editor Katya AdlerWhat is the EU up to while a fevered UK Parliament burns with questions and throbs with Brexit conspiracy theories?Well, the EU is watching and waiting. Arms folded.""It's groundhog day in this negotiation process,"" an EU diplomat told me. ""We (the EU) are again on the outside, watching the UK debate with itself, unsure of what direction to head in. They voted to leave. We've even got an exit deal on the table now but still the UK is undecided.""It is widely expected that MPs will reject the EU withdrawal agreement and blueprint for a future trade deal agreed with the EU.In anticipation of this happening, some MPs are trying to mobilise support for the so-called ""Norway Plus"" option, which they claim could win support across the House of Commons. Under their plan, the current withdrawal agreement would be honoured but the UK would seek to rejoin the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which it belonged to before entering the European Economic Community in 1973 - on an indefinite basis. If Efta's existing members - Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland - agreed, it would allow the UK to retain membership of the customs union and full access to the single market.Advocates of the plan say the UK would still be outside the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy - but it would also mean continued free movement of people.Mrs May said this kind of deal would not fulfil the referendum pledge to take back control of the UK's borders, laws and money.Meanwhile three former Labour foreign secretaries have warned of the damage to British influence around the world if the UK leaves the EU. David Miliband, Jack Straw and Margaret Beckett told the Financial Times they all backed the People's Vote campaign for another referendum. Although Labour is still committed to keeping all options open, Mr McDonnell said if it came to another referendum, it would be ""difficult to see"" an option to remain not being included on the ballot paper. In a speech in Bristol, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox argued that while the deal will not please everyone, critics ""are yet to face up to"" the ""tough choices"" she had to make.He told the BBC the PM was ""changing the public mood"" and while different approaches would give the UK a freer hand to strike other trade deals, they would come with a ""price"" in terms of reduced access to EU markets.The Financial Times says Mrs May is enlisting the support of senior Brexiteers such as Michael Gove and Geoffrey Cox to try to sell her controversial Irish ""backstop"" plan to sceptical Tory MPs.Mr Fox said he was not ""enthusiastic"" about the backstop, which could see the UK enter a customs partnership with the EU until its future relationship is sorted out and without the unilateral right to pull out. But he insisted the chance of the backstop, described as an ""insurance policy"" by Mrs May, actually coming into force was slight as it was just as ""unpalatable"" to other EU members, including the Republic of Ireland. And Treasury Minister Liz Truss, who is backing Mrs May to get the agreement through Parliament, suggested parts of it could be renegotiated after the UK left the EU."
2018-11-30,Minister quits over 'naive' Brexit deal,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-46407249,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA UK minister has resigned saying a row over involvement in the EU's Galileo satellite-navigation system exposes Theresa May's Brexit deal as ""naive"".The UK had wanted to stay part of Galileo after Brexit, but the EU said it would be banned from the extra-secure elements of the programme.Mrs May confirmed on Friday that the UK was pulling out of the project. Science minister Sam Gyimah said the row was ""a clarion call"" and that any deal with Brussels would be ""EU first"".The UK's interests ""will be repeatedly and permanently hammered by the EU27 for many years to come"", he added in a Facebook post setting out his reasons for resigning. Mr Gyimah, who is the 10th minister to resign from the government since Mrs May set out her original proposals for leaving the EU at Chequers in July, also said he would be voting against the deal she had eventually negotiated with Brussels.However, prominent Brexiteer and cabinet minister Michael Gove has defended Mrs May's plan, writing in the Daily Mail that leaving the EU is under ""great threat"" if the deal is rejected by MPs. Galileo is the EU's upcoming version of the US's GPS, which is used by millions of people around the world, and will be used by EU governments, citizens, military and industry.Brussels had said that, as a result of Brexit, the UK would not be allowed immediate access to part of the system intended for use by government agencies, the armed forces and emergency responders once it came online in 2020.But the UK, which has invested €1.4bn in the project, said access was vital to its military and security interests.Mrs May has now said the British army will not use Galileo and the UK will instead explore options to build its own satellite-navigation system - having already set aside £92m to look at how it can be done.""I cannot let our armed services depend on a system we cannot be sure of,"" Mrs May said. ""That would not be in our national interest.""By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editorAs Theresa May was sitting down to at a glittering evening with her fellow world leaders at the G20, news broke that Sam Gyimah had just become the latest minister to quit over Brexit. He had a specific reason to leave. But it is his overall verdict on Mrs May's Brexit compromise that will really hurt. There is some comfort overnight for Mrs May from Michael Gove, who as one of the leading voices in the Leave campaign is, belatedly perhaps, urging his Brexiteer colleagues to get onboard. But this latest resignation is another sign of how hard it will be for the prime minister to pass the vote that could define her future. Read more from Laura hereMr Gyimah, who voted for Remain in the referendum, said it was the right decision for Mrs May to leave the Galileo project, saying the negotiations had been ""stacked against us from the very beginning"".But the MP for East Surrey said it was ""only a foretaste of what's to come"" if the PM's deal was voted through. ""Having surrendered our voice, our vote and our veto, we will have to rely on the 'best endeavours' of the EU to strike a final agreement that works in our national interest,"" he said. ""As minister with the responsibility for space technology I have seen first-hand the EU stack the deck against us time and time again, even while the ink was drying on the transition deal. ""Galileo is a clarion call that it will be 'EU first', and to think otherwise - whether you are a Leaver or Remainer - is at best incredibly naive.""Former Tory cabinet minister and campaigner for another referendum, Justine Greening, said Mr Gyimah was a ""highly respected and capable minister"" and praised him for not ruling out a second vote. And the Lib Dem's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said Mr Gyimah's exit showed the government was ""falling apart"", and that he had ""seen at close quarters the devastating effect this botched Brexit will have on these important sectors"".In his Daily Mail article, Environment Secretary Mr Gove admitted the withdrawal agreement was not ""perfect"".But he stuck by the prime minister, saying it ""delivers in crucial ways which honour the vote to leave"".""Does it deliver 100% of what I wanted? No,"" he added. ""But then we didn't win 100% of the vote on 23 June 2016. ""In politics, as in life, you can't always get everything that you want.""Many people's sat-navs and mobile location services currently run on a US military-based system called GPS - global positioning system - which uses satellites to pinpoint our locations. China and Russia also have satellite-navigation positioning systems.In 1999, the European Union embarked on a plan to put together its own network of satellites, called Galileo, so it was not reliant on the US, Russian and Chinese systems.The first satellites were put into orbit in 2013 and it is planned to be fully operational in 2020 with 30 satellites orbiting earth. UK companies have built components for Galileo and one of the project's two Galileo Security Monitoring Centres was based in the UK, in Swanwick. The site is now being relocated to Spain.The government said there should be no noticeable impact for the public from withdrawing from the project, as devices that already use Galileo, such as smartphones, will carry on doing so.It says UK industry has earned about €1.15bn from the project but, when the BBC asked if any more money would be given back, a spokesman said the project was ""part of the withdrawal agreement"" and the UK had reached ""a fair financial settlement with the EU""."

The two competing sites appear to have a similar look and feel when they appear in Google search results.Google said this did not break the terms of conditions of its site - which routinely allocates the top search spot based on an ad auction.Theresa May is going all out to sell her deal to the public before MPs - a majority of whom are thought to be against it - vote on 11 December.The Cabinet Office does publish how much it spends on marketing government policies, for example it spent £44,219 on Facebook's services in September.But we are unlikely to know how much it has spent on promoting Theresa May's deal on Google until after MPs have voted on it.A government spokesperson said: ""Communicating government policy effectively to the public is a core function of the Civil Service. ""We have reached a deal that is good for the UK, good for its citizens, and good for business and we will be communicating that to the country.

Tell your MP we want control of our waters.End of Facebook post  by Britain's FutureThe site is run by Tim Dawson, a journalist who has written for right-leaning publications like the Telegraph and Spectator. Tim Dawson, who described himself to the BBC as a ""committed Brexiteer"" said he had spent about £2,000 on his campaign.""I'm raising small donations from friends and fellow Brexiteers"", said Mr Dawson, who added that he was not prepared to reveal the identity of those who had given money.The homepage looks rather similar to the government's one but says ""the government has surrendered to the EU"".The page has a video explainer giving the opposite perspective on May's deal, giving reasons why it thinks the agreement is bad for the UK.When BBC journalists in other countries searched for the phrase they got different results, showing the two adverts above are targeted at Google users based in the UK.Here is what comes up when you search for the phrase in Brussels.One sponsored result is for an organisation called KGH Customs, which says it ""can provide you with the people, insights and services to streamline and add value to your customs procedures"".Another is for the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a think tank based in Canada.While the UK results are aimed at the general public, the Brussels adverts seem to be aimed at policy insiders.Searching the same phrase in France and Germany, on the other hand, brings up an advert for Barclays Investment Bank.Google says these are not targeted adverts where companies choose to push messages to particular audiences such as an age group or people living in a certain area of the country.Targeted advertising, particularly on Facebook, has been a major - and controversial - feature of recent election campaigns in the UK and abroad.Who spent what on Facebook during 2017 election campaign?Google says the results appear differently for different people because of the ""keyword bidding system"".Advertisers can choose to push messages based on searches for particular keywords such as ""what is the Brexit deal"".According to Google, when a customer searches for a term matching the keyword, ""your ad can enter an auction to determine if it will show... Since the auction process is repeated for every search on Google, each auction can have potentially different results depending on the competition at that moment.""This means two people sitting next to each other may see a different advert while searching the same thing despite the ads not being ""targeted"" as such - Google does not allow personalised advertising for political groups and other ""prohibited categories"".One peculiar outcome of this is that some Google users may see the two similar-looking adverts on top of each other - one supporting May's deal and one opposing it."

Mrs May has repeatedly warned MPs that the only alternative to her Brexit deal is quitting the EU without a deal on 29 March.The vast majority of Labour MPs are expected to vote against the deal on 11 December. However, a source has told the BBC there is a ""growing consensus"" among all MPs against a ""no-deal"" Brexit.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told ITV's This Morning on Thursday that ""nobody is going to allow no deal"".The amendment, tabled by Labour backbencher and chairman of the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn, is understood to have support from Conservative, Labour, SNP, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green politicians.Mr Benn argues it allows parliament to ""take back control"".""For two years, she [Mrs May] said no deal is better than a bad deal,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. ""But frankly no deal all along has been the worst possible outcome and its really important that we close that off. Because we can't afford to fall over the edge of a cliff at the end of March.""Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the amendment would allow MPs to ""properly debate and vote on the next steps, rather than just leaving it all"" to the prime minister.The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says it supports what ""some in Number 10 suspect - that is vote falls, Parliament essentially takes over from the executive"".This would be exactly what some in Number 10 suspect - that is vote falls, Parliament essentially takes over from the executive and power just drains away https://t.co/wzfsBSf60ZEnd of Twitter post  by @bbclaurakFormer Labour foreign secretary Jack Straw described the amendment as ""a staging post"" on the way to a further referendum.Mr Straw, who was one of the Labour more Eurosceptic voices, says he believes there would be ""a huge appetite"" for a public vote.By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonEnter the four doctors.A cross party quartet, pondering strategy, talking tactics.They want another referendum - what campaigners call a People's Vote. So who are they? Labour's Dr Paul Williams, Conservative GPs turned MPs Philip Lee and Sarah Wollaston, and the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford.Messages are zipping between them, trying to work out whether it is worth putting down an amendment to the big Brexit vote in Parliament, so MPs can express their support for another referendum.I'm told they are in a ""genuine dilemma"" between wanting to articulate the views of those hundreds of thousands who marched through London calling for a ""People's Vote"" in October, but not wanting to ""scupper the whole process"" by failing to get the numbers and allowing opponents to say MPs don't back another referendum.Senior figures in the People's Vote campaign emphasise that they must strike when their strength is at its greatest: after an expected government defeat on 11 December, when they hope Labour will, after failing to secure a general election, edge towards endorsing another referendum. Read more from ChrisUp to six amendments will be voted on when MPs pass judgement on the prime minister's Brexit deal on 11 December.Labour's front bench has tabled an amendment saying that the party cannot support the agreement, as it fails to provide for a customs union and ""strong single market"" deal. It also says it opposes a no deal withdrawal, and ""resolves to pursue every option"" that prevents such a scenario.There is also likely to be a front bench amendment from the SNP. Some in Parliament think they are unlikely to pass but they hope a cross-party effort will be seen as less partisan and will have more chance of achieving a majority.The amendments will be selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow, on 11 December - the last of five days of debate on the Brexit agreement."
2018-11-30,Row over Matt Hancock app interview,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46398174,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowMatt Hancock has been accused of breaking the ministerial code after appearing to endorse a smartphone app.Labour MP Justin Madders is demanding an investigation after the health secretary backed the use of ""GP at Hand"" in an Evening Standard interview.Mr Hancock - who has his own smartphone app - has spoken positively about the ""GP at Hand"" app in the past.But he was not aware his most recent comments would appear in a supplement sponsored by the app's owner.An Evening Standard spokesman said: ""It is not normal practice for us to discuss branding or presentation of articles with interviewees so Mr Hancock would not have been made aware of these.""The article, the spokesman added, was not an an advertorial, meaning the newspaper had full editorial control.A Department of Health spokesman also defended the interview.Mr Hancock's praise for the app, which is made by private healthcare company Babylon, was simply him championing the ""benefits of a range of technologies which can improve patient outcomes, free up clinicians' time and make every pound go further"", a spokesman said.But Mr Madders has argued the interview breaches rules on ministers becoming ""associated with non-public organisations whose objectives may in any degree conflict with government policy"".In a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Madders says the app, which can cost £9.99 a month to use, ""subverts the objective and principles"" of the NHS being free at the point of service - a government policy.He also says any endorsement of the product appears to breach rules preventing ministers ""offering support"" to companies which are in any way reliant on government funding.And he asks for an investigation into whether Mr Hancock received ""any form of gift, hospitality or payment for being interviewed"".This is not the first time Mr Hancock has spoken about the app, as he acknowledged in the article.""I've become known for using this GP at Hand app,"" he told the Standard, going on to defend his support for the app and others like it. ""Serving some people more efficiently allows more resources for the people who don't want to use the technology,"" he said. ""We should embrace technology that helps patient outcomes.""He also listed the Babylon app, which includes GP at Hand, as among his favourite in a different part of the article.In February, Mr Hancock, the former digital minister, became the first MP to launch his own smartphone app, when he was serving as culture secretary.The ""Matt Hancock"" app is aimed at keeping his West Suffolk constituents updated on his activities through videos and picture galleries.First-time users are greeted with a cheery video of Mr Hancock saying: ""Hi I'm Matt Hancock and welcome to my app."""

Matt Golby, the council's leader, said the authority was now making progress towards greater financial stability."
2018-11-30,Rifts laid bare as G20 leaders meet,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-46395758,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWorld leaders have held the opening session of their annual G20 summit, with any number of disputes and disagreements on the table.Host president, Argentina's Mauricio Macri, said the solution was ""dialogue, dialogue and dialogue"" and called for a clear message of shared responsibility.But US President Donald Trump has already cancelled meeting Russia's Vladimir Putin over Ukraine.And huge differences remain on climate change, trade and the Khashoggi affair.The G20, made up of 19 of the world's most industrialised nations plus the EU, accounts for 85% of the world's economic output and two-thirds of the world's population.Its meetings, which began in 2008, are an opportunity for members to develop global policies tackling major issues - but many of the key decisions will be made in one-on-one encounters.There is massive security for the summit in Buenos Aires, with a bank holiday declared for Friday and the city's main business district shut down.Protesters angry at the money spent on the summit while Argentina struggles through tough austerity demonstrated outside the meeting.Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondentMeeting world leaders at the G20 summit was a test for Mohammed bin Salman to see who would snub him.He is the only Arab leader in the G20 and already stood out in his traditional dress amid a sea of suits. And at times he looked uncertain, even nervous. Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand.So the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS.Read onThe world leaders were all called on to the stage and assumed their position for the traditional family photograph.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stood on the outside of the photo, far away from Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan.This is the crown prince's first major diplomatic test since the murder in Turkey of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a key critic of the government. Saudi Arabia has blamed ""rogue agents"" but suspicion has fallen on the prince for ordering the killing.After the photo was taken, the crown prince did manage a hearty exchange with Mr Putin.French President Emmanuel Macron held a five-minute exchange with the crown prince during which, a French official said, Mr Macron had conveyed ""very firm"" messages over the Khashoggi affair.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.Mr Trump had a ""friendly meeting"" with the crown prince, Saudi media said, although the president later said there had been ""no discussion"".UK Prime Minister Theresa May also met the crown prince. A Downing Street spokesman said the PM had ""stressed the importance of ensuring that those responsible for the appalling murder of Jamal Khashoggi are held to account"" and that ""such a deplorable incident"" should not happen again.In addition Mrs May held a 15-minute meeting to discuss trade with Mr Macri. Their two nations have long disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.Mr Macri's opening address to the summit admitted there would be issues of disagreement that needed to be managed.He called for consensus on sustainable development, the future of work, food supply, climate change and international trade, adding: ""I am an optimist"".There are certain to be plenty of bilateral, trilateral or even larger get-togethers, although the one that will not be taking place is the highest-profile.Mr Trump said he would not meet Mr Putin because three Ukrainian vessels and 24 sailors seized by Russia in the Black Sea near Crimea had not been returned.""We don't like what happened. Nobody does,"" he said on Friday.Mr Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Moscow regretted the decision. But he said: ""If this is so, the president will have a couple of extra hours in the programme for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit.""German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blamed the crisis ""entirely"" on Russia and said she would raise the issue with Mr Putin.The second-highest profile meeting will also involve Mr Trump. He will have dinner on Saturday with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.The key issue there will be the nations' trade tariffs dispute.The US has hit a total of $250bn (£196bn) of Chinese goods with tariffs since July, and China has retaliated by imposing duties on $110bn of US products.China said consensus was increasing on a deal but that differences remained.After earlier indicating pessimism on an agreement, Mr Trump said: ""They want to and we'd like to. There are some good signs. We'll see what happens.""Mr Putin has also weighed in, with a thinly veiled attack on Mr Trump's America First policy. The Russian president condemned ""dishonest competition"" along with ""vicious"" sanctions and protectionist measures.The Brics group, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, issued a statement saying protectionism ran counter to the ""spirit and rules of the World Trade Organization"".Ahead of the summit's official start Mr Trump signed a trade deal with the Mexican and Canadian leaders.Mr Trump described the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) - which replaces the Nafta free trade deal - as ""probably the greatest trade deal ever"".""All of our countries will benefit greatly,"" he said.European diplomats told Associated Press there has been tough haggling over a final statement.Argentine officials indicated differences on trade could be overcome. However, that will still leave the obstacle of climate change.Mr Trump has not hidden his objection to collective action on the issue.UN chief Antonio Guterres said in Buenos Aires that ""this is a make-it-or-break-it moment"" on the issue.President Macron was quoted by AFP news agency as saying he would refuse to sign a trade deal with South America's Mercosur bloc if Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro withdrew from the Paris climate accord."

But Labour sources say the party has not yet agreed to take part, with Jeremy Corbyn telling This Morning he preferred ITV's offer.The BBC said it was ""delighted"" Mrs May had accepted the offer.It added it would discuss debate formats with both parties and would announce further details soon.Mr Corbyn claimed he preferred ITV's bid out of ""respect"" for viewers who wanted to watch the I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! final on ITV the same evening - 9 December. ""I want to watch it myself,"" he said.When approached by the BBC, ITV confirmed the final of the show would air at 21:00 GMT.It is understood the BBC debate programme would start at 20:00 in Birmingham, after Strictly Come Dancing and replacing David Attenborough's Dynasties on BBC One.BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mrs May had accepted this offer ""because there was a view on the government's side that the BBC would address the crux of the issue, namely the deal"".By BBC political correspondent Chris MasonRecent history tells us TV debates involving politicians are long in the gestation, and painful in labour.Welcome to 2018's anticipated arrival.The BBC announces Theresa May has agreed to a debate  - but there is a snag. Jeremy Corbyn hasn't said he will turn up. He would rather go on ITV.And so starts the posturing among the telly luvvies along the lines of ""my audience is bigger than yours"".There are other awkward questions for the broadcasters too: where is the passionate Brexiteer voice? Where is the advocate of another referendum?Because even if Mr Corbyn accepts, the two biggest names on the programme wouldn't be a million miles apart on the fundamentals.It would be a discussion between two people who voted Remain and are committed to delivering Brexit, talking to an audience that doesn't have a say on what happens next.Oh and one last thought: this TV show, involving both of them, still might not happen.Mrs May previously rejected calls for smaller political parties to take part in the debate, saying she and Mr Corbyn represented almost 90% of MPs in the Commons between them.However, it is understood the BBC's proposed debate format would include a range of parties and opinions. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involved.Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that the debate should include dialogue ""about all possible routes forward"" - including another referendum.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable - who has also campaigned for another referendum - said he was ""raring and willing to go"" in the TV debate, adding it would be a ""travesty"" if only Mrs May and Mr Corbyn were involved.Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said his party had been ""sidelined throughout the Brexit process"" and their omission from any debate would perpetuate that problem.Further referendum campaign People's Vote, meanwhile, said it had written to both the BBC and broadcasting regulator Ofcom regarding the proposed format of the debate.The group said that, while other views may be represented as part of a panel, it ""would not be acceptable to us if they were relegated to a sideshow away from the main debate between Mrs May and Mr Corbyn"".  Ahead of the 2017 general election, Mrs May refused to take part in televised debates, with then home secretary Amber Rudd standing in for her on the BBC's programme.The prime minister is beginning a two-week campaign to sell her Brexit deal to the public and MPs, before the vote in the House of Commons on 11 December."

But there's no reason for them to have to move to Ireland.""Figures from the Irish consulate show there were:With the figures for the first 10 months of this year available, there have been 847 applications from Scotland.While some of those applying have cited freedom of movement within the EU as one of their motivations, Senator Richmond said the symbolic act of claiming a link with Ireland is just as important.He urged people to ""take the passport, be part of the global diaspora"", adding: ""Ireland has a population of just five million, with a global diaspora of 72 million. It's something we're really proud of.""Analysis by Glenn Campbell, BBC Scotland chief political correspondentIf you have an Irish grandparent, you can apply for citizenship by having your name added to the register of foreign births.It is applications of this sort from residents in Scotland that are almost 19 times higher in the first ten months of this year compared to 2013.These figures don't include those who might have a parent born on the island of Ireland and therefore a more direct route to establishing their Irish citizenship. You need citizenship in order to apply for an Irish passport.For many, Ireland is their insurance policy - a way of guaranteeing EU freedom of movement rights in the future, regardless of how Brexit turns out.

Mr Brokenshire said it was possible councillors ""would serve for only one year with their council then being abolished"" if the elections took place.""Elections in such circumstances risk confusing voters and would involve significant costs that would be hard to justify,"" he said.The leader of Wellingborough Borough Council, Martin Griffiths, said work already been done on ideas for the restructure and this would be ""stepped up"".Jonathan Nunn, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said: ""Given the tight timescales we have continued with our work on unitary councils, and so it's good to now have certainty that things are progressing in Westminster.""  Mr Brokenshire also issued the first report by commissioners appointed this year to run the county council.It confirmed the council's budget deficit of up to £70m would be cleared using capital receipts from the sale of assets to balance the books.But because of a projected overspend of £30m in 2018/19 all non-essential spending was being frozen.Only identified ""core services"" will be funded and money controlled by finance officers overseen by appointed outside monitors.""We are confident that the sum of these measures will deliver considerable savings,"" the commissioners' report said.By Tom Barton, political reporter The news that the government is to allow Northamptonshire County Council to use £70m of savings, normally reserved for capital projects such as buildings and infrastructure, is unprecedented.   The move will allow the council to pay back some of last year's £35m overspend and give it a real chance of balancing its books this coming year. Other councils facing extreme financial pressure will be watching this development with interest, and many will hope they will be allowed to do the same thing. In reality, that it is highly unlikely, since accounting rules normally forbid the switching of money between capital and revenue funds.  Communities Secretary James Brokenshire would have to give his personal sanction to any other requests to follow in Northamptonshire's footsteps. "

Enter the four doctors who also happen to be members of Parliament.Labour's Dr Paul Williams, Conservative GPs turned MPs Dr Phillip Lee and Dr Sarah Wollaston, and the SNP's Dr Philippa Whitford are carefully pondering their next move.Messages are zipping between them, trying to work out whether it is worth putting down an amendment to the big Brexit vote in parliament on 11 December, so MPs can express their support for another referendum.They are protagonists in one of the many sub-plots being whispered about here at Westminster, in a play called ""what happens when....?"".The ""when"" is technically an ""if"", but feels increasingly likely that the prime minister's vision of Brexit, agreed with the European Union, will be rejected by Parliament next month.The big question will then be: What happens next? The honest answer is no one knows. But that also means the stage will appear to be clear - or as clear as it has been for a long time - for those with alternative visions of the UK's future relationship with the EU to make their case, and try to persuade Parliament to back it.So, back to our four doctors. I'm told they are in a ""genuine dilemma"".Part of them is itching to articulate in Parliament, with a vote, the views of those hundreds of thousands who marched through London calling for a ""People's Vote"" in October.But they know they only have one chance and don't want to, as it was put to me, ""scupper the whole process"" by having a vote in the House of Commons, failing to get the numbers needed to get it through - and allowing opponents to say MPs don't back another referendum.That, they fear, could kill the idea stone dead.As text messages ping from Stockton-on-Tees to Totnes, Bracknell to Central Ayrshire, the constituencies of the doctors, they are thrashing out what to do.Their deadline isn't imminent. I'm told an amendment doesn't have to be tabled until 10 December, the day before the vote.Some think it would be very strange if Parliament does not discuss a referendum in the next few weeks.But senior voices in the People's Vote campaign are urging restraint.They should be patient, is the essence of the message.The focus must be, they argue, on the moment when the campaign's strength is at its greatest - and some believe that moment would be immediately after any defeat for the government on its deal.And this is where Labour's backing of a cross-party attempt to ensure the UK cannot leave the EU without a deal is important. Perhaps, some ponder, it could be a necessary, but not sufficient stepping stone towards another referendum.The thinking goes like this: if parliament spoke loudly against no deal, but also rejected the government's proposed deal, what happens next?The government could still press ahead with a no-deal Brexit.But advocates of another referendum could pop up and say ""Parliament is gridlocked, there's no majority for anything, so let the people have a say"".At that point, they hope, Labour will have called for a general election but failed to get one, and so will endorse another referendum.And so there might be a Parliamentary majority for a further referendum.That does not guarantee there would be one: a government would have to bring forward legislation to make it happen and the UK's departure date from the EU would have to be postponed.These are both huge steps.And who knows what the question would be in any referendum, when it would be held, and who would win?But this is the outline of the discussion going on among those who would love to see it happen; the thinking in the middle of one of the many sub-plots of fevered conversation going on here.A campaign long dismissed by its critics as marginal, feels like it has some momentum.And that is because Westminster is agog with a guessing game. Let's not dignify it with highfalutin language, that is precisely what it is.But when the future is so uncertain, plenty are willing to sketch out how they would like to see it look. "

2018-11-30,Tory Brexit tribes,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46386172,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWith a Commons vote on her Brexit agreement set for 11 December, Theresa May has less than two weeks to turn her fortunes around. However, at this point, the prime minister's deal seems to have only further entrenched Tory battle lines against her. The number of Conservative MPs against the deal currently floats at around 93, according to the latest BBC tally. This only includes those who have explicitly stated they don't support it. Total opposition, including Tory MPs who have yet to publicly declare their position, is said to be well over 100. There are 315 Tory MPs in Parliament - not counting two who are currently suspended - and they have splintered off into a bewildering array of factions over Brexit.Here's a guide to the different groups.They're advocating, and have long advocated, leaving the EU without a deal in place, or on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, and have categorically ruled out supporting the prime minister's deal. Made up of the most fervent and veteran Brexit supporters within the European Research Group, the Eurosceptic think tank headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, these MPs view achieving their version of Brexit as more important than keeping Theresa May in No 10.Some, arguably, think it is even more important than keeping the Conservatives in government - although chances are you probably won't hear them admitting this publicly (the Democratic Unionist Party, who keep Mrs May in power, have recently hinted at this, if it means the deal's proposals for Northern Ireland can be ditched). They are only a handful in number, but given Mrs May's increasingly slim parliamentary majority - with the DUP also opposed to her deal - this troublesome tribe could prove numerous enough to sink her deal.This group thinks there is no longer enough time to realistically achieve a renegotiation of the deal on offer before the legislated exit day of 29 March 2019, as well as believing the prime minister has used up all her bargaining power and political capital in Brussels and has reached the point of no return, or, as numerous EU leaders stated last weekend: ""This is it."" These Conservatives argue that a no-deal Brexit - where the UK would leave the EU on WTO trading terms - is better than the deal Mrs May has put on the table and the only option left in the face of what they view as an inevitable defeat in parliament. Some cabinet ministers are rumoured to be quietly making the argument for a ""negotiated no deal"", whereby the UK's EU membership would be extended to allow the government to better prepare for leaving without a deal.According to Article 50 rules, leaving without a deal is technically the default option for the UK should a deal not be reached, bar a change in government. But despite this small group of advocates, a no-deal Brexit is not likely to get a majority of MPs in Parliament behind it. Many MPs have vowed to find a way to prevent the UK from ""crashing out"", should the prime minister's deal be defeated in parliament.  Vocally-supported by the likes of Boris Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who both resigned in July over Mrs May's Chequers blueprint, this group of mostly European Research Group members have been arguing for a Canada-style free trade agreement (also known as ""Canada +++"" or ""Super Canada"" in some circles) for some time. Some MPs who previously resided in this tribe have broken off to align themselves with the aforementioned No Dealers faction. Some at this point may be in favour of extending Article 50 in order to make room for renegotiation, despite extension being a previous red line for many in this group.  The group recently set out their vision for the UK again in a document entitled ""Your Right to Know: the case against Chequers and the draft Withdrawal Agreement in plain English"". They claim a Canada-type deal - whereby the UK would be out of the single market and customs union, with no tariffs or quotas on any imports and exports between the UK and EU - is a ""superior alternative"" to the prime minister's deal. Mrs May claims their solution fails to adequately solve the Irish border question in that the plan would create a hard border. Many, if not all, in this group also have strong objections to the Irish backstop, and insist on it being binned in favour of no backstop at all. Tory backbencher Nick Boles has branded their proposal a ""Fantastic Beast of Johnsonian Folklore"". Mr Boles is among those Conservatives arguing for a Norway-style Brexit instead.The so-called ""Norway Plus"" option would see the UK retaining membership of the customs union and full access to the single market - meaning freedom of movement and the payments to the EU for market access the prime minister wants to end would likely continue. But Norway's advocates say we'd be outside the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and outside the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).  Current EFTA members include Switzerland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.This proposal has evolved since it was first put forward, when it said the UK should gain (or regain; we left in 1972 when we joined the EEC, under Edward Heath) temporary membership of EFTA for a few years until we negotiate a strong free trade deal. However, the consensus in European diplomatic circles is that current members as well as the EU would be against temporary UK membership of the bloc. Now, Norway is being pitched as an indefinite solution to a deal that looks likely to die on the doorstep of Parliament. Conservatives such as George Freeman are claiming this proposal enjoys cross-party support and is ""the only sensible way to deliver the EU referendum result"". Indeed, it's rumoured some cabinet ministers are willing to get on board with this option if the draft agreement falls in the Commons.The Conservatives who openly support the prime minister's deal are mainly made up of loyal government ministers. The trouble is, there currently still aren't enough of them to get the prime minister's deal through Parliament - and there's still no ruling out even more ministerial resignations than we've already seen in between now and voting day.Then there are the pragmatic backbenchers (see below for another breed of pragmatists who openly criticise the deal). This group would normally make up a large, silent majority chunk in the middle of the party, shielding themselves from the din of ardent Leavers and Remainers. They're normally loyal to party policy and vote accordingly on Brexit matters. However, Theresa May's deal has melted away support even from this tribe, who were in fact dangerously shaky in numbers even before the deal was unveiled thanks to the Conservatives' lack of a working majority.Though clear in their opposition to the prime minister's deal, not all Conservatives are giving up on it altogether. The bulk of this tribe are made up of MPs who have serious concerns about the backstop proposals for Northern Ireland. Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, has emphasised the extent to which the backstop remains a sticking point with many backbenchers: ""It is interesting the number of Conservative MPs that like me will swallow everything else they are not happy with, and may be persuaded.""But the issue of part of the country being treated different to the rest is something many of us find completely unacceptable.""This group also includes the DUP, with leader Arlene Foster insisting that Theresa May can find ""a third way, a better way"". However, other recent comments by Ms Foster, suggesting a Jeremy Corbyn-led government is preferable to the prime minister's deal, would relocate the Northern Irish party into a far more extreme tribe than this one.Others have pointed to what they see as the positives in May's deal, such as ending freedom of movement and shielding the UK economy from the uncertainty of a no-deal Brexit. Some also stress that there is room for more manoeuvre on the details of the future relationship. But these upsides have so far failed to surmount other concerns, such as those surrounding aspects of the transition period, the role of the European Court of Justice and the £39bn ""divorce payment"". These are the Conservatives who despite their distaste for the deal, are supporting it through gritted teeth. It could be that many of these are choosing not to publicly state their position either way as of yet, but will begrudgingly cast their vote in favour when it comes to the day due to a lack of other options. Theresa May will certainly be hoping this group increases in number in the coming weeks, as it seems clear that winning over direct converts from either side in large numbers is unlikely. Lead pragmatist Nicky Morgan, previously of the Norway tribe, has called on MPs to discard their ""entrenched positions"" and back the prime minister. Ken Clarke dubbed the deal ""a bit of a dog's breakfast"", but has vowed to support it regardless - despite being a veteran Remainer.This tribe would probably have viewed any deal as worse than staying in the EU. Many privately support another referendum, but have yet to join the handful of Tory MPs who openly back the People's Vote campaign, alongside the likes of Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve. If the prime minister's deal is rejected, a large group of MPs currently keeping quiet could come out to publicly support another referendum, aligning themselves with many Labour MPs. Other parts of the tribe are hoping an EU Supreme Court ruling will see the UK being able to unilaterally revoke Article 50, potentially paving the way to cancel Brexit altogether. After Jo Johnson's recent resignation as a government minister and support for this option, the People's Vote campaign has received a Tory boost. This option is being sold as the only way to solve the current impasse in Parliament. These Tories also campaign across party lines and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Labour MPs such as Chuka Ummuna. The People's Vote campaign's march in Westminster recently attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters. The campaign also has the support of former Prime Minister John Major, who told the BBC as early as July that the case for another referendum was ""morally justified"". Leading campaigner Anna Soubry told the BBC: ""The best deal we have with the EU is the current deal…people are realising our country has made a terrible mistake."" "
2018-11-30,Five key questions,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/health-46350966,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowWhether it is a no-deal Brexit or the agreement brokered by the prime minister, leaving the European Union promises to have a profound impact on patients and the wider NHS.From the staff who work on the wards and in the GP surgeries to the supply of vital medicines, there are implications. Here is a look at six key questions.The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU - although it exports even more.The port of Dover is the key supply route in and the transition arrangements mean it will remain unaffected. The key challenge will be if there is a no-deal Brexit, because there is concern of potential huge delays at the port.The government has asked firms to stockpile a six-week supply of drugs to mitigate any problems if there is no deal. However, that is logistically difficult for medicines that need refrigerating, like insulin and vaccines, or those with a short shelf life, such as some cancer drugs.Supplies of radioactive materials for scans could also be hit. Contingency plans have been put in place to fly in vital treatments,  the government has said. But even the stockpiling of normal medicines is proving problematic, according to industry.Small firms in particular have reported problems stockpiling drugs because they do not have the cash flows to fund reserves of supplies. Last month, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told the Health Select Committee that he was ""very concerned"" about the prospect of a no deal, saying it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs.He even suggested the public may have to stockpile drugs themselves.The government has always insisted this is not needed - and could in fact make the situation worse.Only this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was telling MPs that while a no-deal scenario would be ""difficult"", he was ""confident that if everyone does everything they need to do, then we will have an unhindered supply of medicines"".The health and social care sectors are huge employers with one-and-a-half million and two million staff respectively. About 5% of the registered workforce in each area are from Europe.The Brexit agreement means all those currently working will have the opportunity to obtain ""settled status"" to allow them to stay. It is not clear what a no-deal Brexit would mean. The government has also indicated it will create a skilled migrants system similar to the one that operates for workers from the rest of the world. That system - known as tier two visas - allows doctors and senior nurses to be recruited from overseas.But unions have pointed out that some lower-paid nurses and non-clinical staff such as health care assistants, porters and care workers will not be covered by such a system, because the cut-off is that the worker must be earning at least £30,000 a year.There are other related factors too.The message Brexit sends to people from Europe and the weaker value of the pound, which means any money sent back to their homeland is worth less, could put off people from working in the UK.That is a point made last month by the Cavendish Coalition, a group of 36 health and care charities. It predicted Brexit could worsen the staffing shortages currently being seen in the health service.The government is more confident, arguing staff from Europe will stay and that it has a plan to ""grow its own"", with increasing numbers of doctors and nurses in training.About 27 million people in the UK have European Health Insurance Cards. They entitle the holder to state-provided medical treatment across the EU and also in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland.The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions as well as emergency care. This will continue during the transition period, but, like much else, what happens afterwards has yet to be resolved.And if there is a no deal, the cover EHIC provides will cease to exist in theory. Attempts could be made to put reciprocal agreements in place - and given the amount of tourism into the UK from Europe it would clearly be in everyone's interest to ensure individuals are entitled to health care.Then there are the one million UK citizens who live abroad in the EU.They are currently eligible for the same health care as citizens of the EU country in which they live and they can use EHIC when they travel. The EU and UK have agreed that these people would retain their rights, but once again a no-deal Brexit could scupper that.The UK is considered a world leader in medical research, having produced around 25 of the top 100 prescription treatments.The country currently benefits from access to research funding from the EU via programmes such as Horizon 2020 and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. These will continue during the transition phase, but beyond that it seems likely the UK will be treated as a third-party collaborator, meaning it will be less likely to lead programmes and will have little role in the design of them.Collaboration on rare diseases could also be put at risk. As the number of patients with rare conditions in each country is low, it is only possible to recruit enough patients for clinical trials by carrying out those trials across countries, according to the Brexit Health Alliance.Restrictions to the free movement of researchers and academics could also have an impact. Around three-quarters of UK researchers have worked abroad and currently nearly a fifth of science, technology, engineering and mathematics academics at UK institutions are from the EU.The government believes a ""mutually beneficial outcome"" is perfectly possible to deal with all these problems, given the UK is such a key player in medical and scientific research.The government is also increasing its spending on research and development.Clearly, the NHS is struggling to cope with the number of patients it is seeing. The three key waiting time targets for cancer, A&E and hospital operations are being missed in every part of the UK.The public does believe migrants are a factor in this - or at least the wider demand on services. In 2017 an Ipsos opinion poll found 58% of people in the UK agreed with the view that immigration placed pressure on public services.The government's Migration Advisory Committee looked at this in the autumn.Its report found migrants were net contributors to the health service - in that they gave more than they took. That is because of the significant numbers working in the health service and the fact they were less likely to use it.The committee said this was because they tended to be young and healthy. The only exception was in maternity care, the committee said.The proportion of births to mothers from the EU has trebled in the past 15 years to one in 10.It was one of the most controversial claims of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave said the money saved in payments to the EU would mean an extra £350m a week could be spent on the NHS.The prime minister has claimed this has come true. Over the summer she announced the NHS budget would increase by £20bn by 2023.On top of that, about £4bn will be given to the rest of the UK.That amounts to more than the promised £350m a week.Theresa May has said it will be partly paid for by a Brexit ""dividend"".Although, as the UK is committed to paying into the EU budget until the end of the transition period and will also have to pay the £39bn divorce bill, it arguably leaves little to cover the cost of the rise.The Treasury has said a combination of economic growth and perhaps even tax rises may be needed.Another way to look at it is to ask whether the NHS would have got such a rise if Brexit was not on the cards?Many think so. After all, it was long overdue. Since 2010 the NHS has been receiving between 1% to 2% extra each year - half the average rises it previously enjoyed.  "
2018-11-30,The Brexit guide,https://web.archive.org//web/20181201013220/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46192884,"Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowTheresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, although two ministers resigned in protest at it. They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration.Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on Tuesday, 11 December. If she clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament.There are two documents.A draft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal from the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes:The other document is a 26 page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019.The declaration includes:This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk.So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs will vote on Tuesday, 11 December.Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons have said they will vote against it. Dozens of Conservative MPs - some reports say as many as 80 - are also opposed to it. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it.Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"".Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that."

Theresa May promised the end of austerity was in sight as she urged her party to put their Brexit divisions behind them and take the fight to Labour.In her closing leader's speech, the prime minister said the Conservatives must not be the party for the few nor the many, but for everyone who worked hard.She announced plans to free up councils to borrow against their assets to fund house building, action to save lives through earlier cancer diagnoses and investment in scanning plus another year's freeze in fuel duty.In a generally well-received performance, which began with her sashaying her way on to the stage to the strains of Abba's Dancing Queen, the PM signalled more money for public services after next year's Spending Review.On Brexit, which dominated the conference, she did not mention her much-criticised Chequers plan by name but warned critics that by holding out for the perfect deal they risked ending up not leaving at all. This was, in large part, a riposte to former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who a day earlier told a large fringe crowd that Mrs May's strategy was undemocratic and would ""cheat"" those who voted for Brexit in 2016.Mr Johnson, who quit the cabinet in July, prompted renewed talk of a leadership bid by attacking Mrs May's reform of stop and search powers when she was home secretary and calling for a tax-cutting agenda.While talk of a May-Johnson face-off garnered most of the week's headlines and many ministers found themselves greeted by sparse crowds on the conference floor, there were a string of announcements made. These included an emergency £240m social car package to enable more elderly people to be cared for at home, a pilot scheme to cut down on food waste and a ban on combustible cladding in all new residential buildings, as well as schools and hospitals, over 60ft in height.Jeremy Corbyn ended the week in Liverpool by telling supporters Labour was ready to return to government, with a ""radical plan to rebuild and transform our country"".The Labour leader vowed to end the ""greed-is-good"" culture he said had dominated politics for decades, saying his party's promise of greater state intervention in the markets was the ""new common sense of our time"". He also offered to back Theresa May if she presented a ""sensible"" Brexit deal to MPs for approval.He used his keynote speech to announce some new policies - such as on childcare and green jobs - but it was mainly a chance to rally the troops for another general election, which Labour wants above all. The most significant event of the week, in policy terms, was members' decision to back a new Brexit policy stating that all options should remain on the table, including the possibility of another referendum.The party's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, caused a stir when he told activists that nobody should rule out the option of remaining in the EU being on the ballot paper in a future referendum - a view that is not shared by some in the party. On the economic front, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour while all large firms would be forced to give workers shares worth up to £500 a year each - a plan for ""inclusive ownership funds"" immediately attacked by business. There were no major rows - and there were plenty of ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" chants - although the party was criticised for dropping plans to create a second deputy leader position, to be filled by a woman, following opposition from left-wing campaign groups.Nicola Sturgeon called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her leader's speech to the SNP conference.The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent one day.She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in the 2014 independence referendum.She also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless.As they met in Glasgow, the party confirmed its 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled in the UK Parliament.Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", Ms Sturgeon said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"".In his second keynote speech to conference as their leader, Sir Vince Cable said the UK's exit from the European Union was ""not inevitable"" and must be stopped.He claimed there was a growing realisation that Brexit would be ""costly and painful"", particularly in a no-deal scenario, and urged Jeremy Corbyn to get behind the cross-party campaign for another referendum.Much of the coverage following the speech surrounded the phrase ""erotic spasm"".The headline-grabbing attack on Brexiteers was included in the trail of the speech released the night before but Sir Vince somewhat mangled it during its delivery and the words came out as ""exotic spresm"".Elsewhere, anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller - touted as a possible successor to Sir Vince - told the party she was their friend but not a leader-in-waiting as she was not even a party member.UKIP should become a ""radical, populist party"" standing up for free speech against the ""politically-correct thought police"", its leader Gerard Batten told party activists.As the party met in Birmingham, it published an ""interim manifesto"" urging a ""clean exit"" from the EU, the abolition of stamp duty and inheritance tax, new grammar schools, scrapping the overseas aid budget and BBC licence fee and an end to guidelines on ""subjective"" hate crimes.Mr Batten, the party's sixth leader since the Brexit referendum, said these policies were aimed at low and middle-income families and small businesses which ""form the backbone of Britain"".The Green Party unveiled a series of policies which they said could help them overtake the Lib Dems as the third largest party in England and Wales while offering a ""real alternative"" to Labour. Among them were a ""Free Time Index"" to measure the UK's ""well-being"", as an alternative to traditional economic indicators and paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover.Co-leader Sian Berry said this was ""radical common sense for the common good"". On Brexit, she said momentum behind calls for a new referendum ""feels absolutely unstoppable"".Her co-leader Jonathan Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" to deal with the threat from climate change saying his party would no longer ""debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"".Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Adam Price told activists in his first major speech since being elected leader. Comparing Brexit to the Titanic disaster, he warned that Wales could find itself ""at the mercy of Westminster"" if the UK left the EU's single market and customs union.Domestically, he promised a ""new vision"" for health and social care, with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators.If it won power, he said Plaid would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and introduce a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose."

It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past. Further reading: The rise of the word BrexitA referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%. The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Get the results in full.England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%. Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%. Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU. Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave. See the results in more detail.The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list). It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other. It has since grown to become a ""single market"" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country. It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges. Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.For the UK to leave the EU it had to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty which gives the two sides two years to agree the terms of the split. Theresa May triggered this process on 29 March, 2017, meaning the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm UK time on Friday, 29 March 2019. It can be extended if all 28 EU members agree, but at the moment all sides are focusing on that date as being the key one, and Theresa May has now put it into British law.The UK government and the main UK opposition party both say Brexit will happen. There are some groups campaigning for Brexit to be halted, but the focus among the UK's elected politicians has been on what relationship the UK has with the EU after Brexit, rather than whether Brexit will happen at all. Nothing is ever certain, but as things stand Britain is leaving the European Union, although government ministers have started warning that Brexit might not happen if their plan for it is not backed by MPs when they vote on it. There is more detail on the possible hurdles further down this guide...After months of negotiation, the UK and EU have agreed a Brexit deal. It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement. This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated £39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK. It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border. A 26-page statement on future relations. This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.  The UK cabinet agreed the withdrawal agreement text on 14 November, but there were two resignations, including Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and there was an, as yet unsuccessful, attempt by Brexiteer MPs to force a confidence vote in Theresa May.The next step is for MPs to vote on the deal, which will take place on 11 December after five days of debate. If they pass it, the European Parliament will get a vote before Brexit day next March.It refers to a period of time after 29 March, 2019, to 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin. It also allows more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out. Free movement will continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted. The UK will be able to strike its own trade deals - although they won't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021. This transition period is currently only due to happen if the UK and the EU agree a Brexit deal.Not in detail. But the 26-page political declaration referred to above, gives some detail of their aspirations on things like trade, travel and security will work. The UK's 310 mile land border with the EU - between Northern Ireland and EU member the Republic of Ireland -  might not have been everyone's big issue during the 2016 referendum campaign, yet it has come to dominate Brexit talks.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people. But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea.Theresa May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise).But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once.

Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU.It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including:Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has also floated the idea of Labour forming a minority government without a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May. The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum. She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out. Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want. Her key message has been that ""Brexit means Brexit"" and she triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017. She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk. She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy. She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020). She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders. She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy. However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.  You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum -  and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro. Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.  The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 although there was slower growth, of 0.6% in the first half of 2018. Inflation rose after June 2016 but has since eased to stand at 2.2%. Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%. Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 3.2% in the year to August 2018, according to official ONS figures. This is the lowest annual increase in prices for five years, but it is still higher than inflation so property continues to show ""real terms"" increases in prices.They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017. Here's a picture from that first session:The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits. Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called ""divorce bill"", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border. A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks. They then agreed terms for the ""transition"" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so. It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009. Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs - which spell out that any EU member state may decide to quit the EU, that it must notify the European Council and negotiate its withdrawal with the EU, that there are two years to reach an agreement - unless everyone agrees to extend it - and that the exiting state cannot take part in EU internal discussions about its departure. The Conservative government introduced the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill to Parliament to end the primacy of EU law in the UK on Brexit Day. This ""Great Repeal Bill"", as it was originally called, incorporates all EU legislation into UK law in one lump, after which the government will decide over a period of time which parts to keep, change or remove. The bill was subject to fierce debate as it passed through Parliament, with a number of attempts to change its wording. It finally became law in June 2018. Read a full guide to the bill.Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen. But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election. If, however, it stops the PM's plan and there is no general election it says the option of a new referendum would be on the table.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now. This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules. He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market. Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.  Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says Labour should seek to delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, if it wins power in a general election before 29 March.These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, ""hard"" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements. At the other end of the scale, a ""soft"" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place. Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market. In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country. It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it. The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices. But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a ""level playing field"". Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs. Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule. Theresa May has ruled out the UK staying in the single market, a position backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Read more: A free trade area v EU single marketThe customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU. It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area. In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it amid divisions in cabinet over the two options - a customs partnership and a technology based ""maximum facilitation"" arrangement. Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks. Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, is foreign secretary. These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU. However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan. Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary. Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting involved in the Brussels talks. Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.The Article 50 process lasts two years so the intention is for the UK to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. EU law still stands in the UK until it ceases being a member. But as things stand there will not be a final break on that day as the two sides have agreed to a 21-month transition period to allow a smooth implementation of whatever Brexit deal is negotiated and minimise disruption to businesses and holidaymakers etc. Unpicking 43 years of treaties and agreements covering thousands of different subjects was never going to be a straightforward task. It is further complicated by the fact that it has never been done before and negotiators are, to some extent, making it up as they go along. The post-Brexit trade deal is likely to be the most complex part of the negotiation because it needs the unanimous approval of more than 30 national and regional parliaments across Europe, some of whom may want to hold referendums.Please upgrade your browser to view this content.The UK could cut all ties, but Theresa May and others would like to avoid such a ""cliff-edge"" where current regulations on things like cross-border trade and travel between the UK and the EU ends overnight. They think it would harm the economy and cause chaos at the UK's borders.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would operate with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules, which could mean customs checks and tariffs on goods as well as longer border checks for travellers.There are also questions about what would happen to Britain's position as a global financial centre and the land border between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. There is also concern that Brits living abroad in the EU could lose residency rights and access to free emergency health care. Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal'An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts. UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules. Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement. Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal. Healthcare rights will continue as now although it is not clear yet what status an EHIC card would have for other travellers after Brexit. For the full details please see the UK-EU agreement. As with all other aspects of Brexit, this agreement would only come into force if and when the UK and the EU agree on an overall Brexit deal.UK government ministers say there will be an online system - similar to one used to renew driving licences - that will take minutes to complete with a fee similar to getting a passport, which is about £72. Read more details here: UK unveils EU citizen registration planWe don't yet know what it would mean for recent arrivals, but it's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.  With rising talk of a no deal Brexit, Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit. The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a ""transition"" phase of about two years. There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections. The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, although it is widely expected that there will be a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals.People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive. The UK inflation figure for the year to September 2018 was 2.2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration. She has said this will be a focus of Brexit negotiations as she remains committed to getting net migration - the difference between the numbers entering and leaving the country - down to a ""sustainable"" level, which she defines as being below 100,000 a year. The government is due to publish its post-Brexit immigration plans shortly, which it says will give priority to skilled migrants, regardless of whether they come from EU countries or non-EU countries, ending the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.The rate of increase in the size of Britain's population has slowed since the Brexit vote. Annual net migration is estimated to have fallen by nearly a third from the time of the referendum to 271,000 in the year to March 2018. ""Brexit could well be a factor in people's decision to move to or from the UK, but people's decision to migrate is complicated and can be influenced by lots of different reasons,"" the Office for National Statistics said. Read more: What has been Brexit effect on migration?Campaigners, led by a group called the People's Vote, are calling for the public to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. Theresa May does not want another referendum, arguing that it would be an undemocratic breach of trust with the British people who clearly voted to Leave. The Labour leadership was initially against another referendum, saying it would prefer to see a general election if Theresa May's plans were voted down by MPs. But leader Jeremy Corbyn has agreed to abide by a vote of party members at the Labour conference, which backed keeping the idea of another referendum on the table.Which brings us to the next question...Yes. Theresa May has promised there will be a Commons and Lords vote to approve the deal the UK and the rest of the EU have agreed. The Commons vote is expected to happen on 12 December.In theory, yes, but the EU side would need to agree too. The referendum result is not legally binding but the UK has triggered the automatic process of leaving the EU. MPs could vote against the exit deal between the UK and EU. This would mean the UK would be on track to leave without a deal, rather than halting the process. Some anti-Brexit MPs believe that if that happens, they could then persuade enough of their colleagues to back a second referendum.The UK government wants to keep visa-free travel to the UK for EU visitors after Brexit and it is hoping this will be reciprocated, meaning UK citizens will continue to be able to visit EU countries for short periods without seeking official permission to travel.If visitors from EU countries wanted to work, study or settle in the UK they would have to apply for permission under the proposals. No agreement has been reached yet, however. If it is decided that EU citizens will need visas to come to the UK in the future, then UK citizens will need visas to travel to the EU.Yes. It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same. The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.No nation state has ever left the EU. But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation. The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was ""democratically unacceptable"" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain. She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the ""least damaging"" option for the UK economy as a whole.There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The bill will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments. The often-quoted estimate of the so-called ""divorce bill"" is £39bn. But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more. The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its ""strict international legal obligations"". The UK could leave without any Brexit ""divorce bill"" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court. If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low. The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018. Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Journalists and writers on social media have greeted the reintroduction of duty-free sales as an ""upside"" or ""silver lining"" of Brexit. As with most Brexit consequences, whether this will happen depends on how negotiations with the EU play out - whether the ""customs union"" agreement between Britain and the EU is ended or continued.If you are already living in another EU country on the day the UK leaves the bloc, 29 March 2019, your EHIC card - which entitles travellers to state-provided medical help for any condition or injury that requires urgent treatment, in any other country within the EU, as well as several non-EU countries - will continue to work.After that date, for EU citizens wishing to travel to the UK or UK citizens wishing to travel to the EU, it is unclear about what will happen because no deal has yet been reached.Read more hereProbably not, says BBC Europe correspondent Chris Morris, because there's no EU-wide law on vehicle registration or car number places, and the EU flag symbol is a voluntary identifier and not compulsory.  The DVLA says there has been no discussion about what would happen to plates with the flag if the UK voted to leave.The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine. So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority. It is based in Luxembourg. It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the ECHR not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects. The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade. It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the ""direct"" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit. But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after BrexitAfter that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided. There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU. Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining. But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands. New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU. They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet. A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving. They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return. They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work. One of the main principles of EU membership is ""free movement"", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country. The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of ""ever closer union"" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a ""United States of Europe"". Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in. He said the deal would give Britain ""special"" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in. The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign. The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in. The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.  Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services. They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world. Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU. Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound. Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU. Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler. There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - ""much to France's chagrin"", she says.Probably not, is the answer. It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards. Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this pageThe good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list. Click here for the latest version.In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out. Only France and Germany contribute more. In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to £4.6bn in 2014/15. According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was £8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10. The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and  measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was £5.7bn. Read more number crunching from Reality Check.David, from East Sussex, is worried about what will happen to his retirement plans. At the moment, the large British expat community in Spain gets free access to Spanish GPs and their hospital treatment is paid for by the NHS. After they become permanent residents Spain pays for their hospital treatment. In some other EU countries such as France expats of working age are expected to pay the same healthcare costs as locals but once they reach retirement age their medical bills are paid by the NHS.The deal agreed in principle between the UK and the EU means the position will remain unchanged for British people living in the EU before the Brexit cut off date (29 March 2019) - but it has yet to be decided what happens if you want to retire to somewhere in the EU after that date. Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill. That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.  The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied. The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.  The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws. Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry. We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: ""All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe. Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC.""The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, form part of the negotiations.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws. It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.Of course, until the UK actually leaves the EU, the scheme continues as normal.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a long history of world-leading animal welfare and biosecurity standards, which we are committed to safeguarding and improving, securing the best deal for Britain as we leave the EU.""Brexit: All you need to knowSo far, the answer is no. The average price for property has continued to increase, although the rate of annual price rise has slowed from 9.4% in the year to June 2016 to 3% in the year to June 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics.Ged, from Liverpool, suspects ""red tape"" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection. According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related. The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs £4.7bn a year, tops the list. The working time directive (£4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (£2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019. Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them. Brexit may also generate ""red tape"" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Ste, in Bolton, asked about this. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership  - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of £10bn a year. But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it wouldl shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights. This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS. This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was £350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead. The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses. The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as ""scaremongering"" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of ""home grown"" doctors qualifying through new medical schools. But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting. Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a ""Brexit dividend"" was helping fund a larger-than-planned £20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.This is a question from Barry. The European Court of Human Rights is not an EU institution and that's why discussions about leaving it have not formed a key part of the Brexit debate.The European Court of Justice - the ECJ - is one of the primary institutions of the European Union and administers EU law. So, while it might have a role in supervising a future trade deal, part of the goal of Brexit was to remove the UK from the ECJ's jurisdiction.The European Court of Human Rights which, as Barry points out, can be even more controversial, is a body set up not by the EU but by member states of the Council of Europe, a separate institution which contains countries that aren't EU members.It's this court which has produced rulings which have been controversial in the UK, including blocking the extradition of Abu Qatada and establishing the right of serving prisoners to vote in elections - and leaving the EU won't change anything here.As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs. That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free. On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own. That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU. The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU. The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU. Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%. Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars. The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.If the UK were to get a fantastic Brexit deal then maybe others would be tempted to go.But the truth is, lots of European politicians want the EU to be tough with Britain precisely to stop other countries from following it through the door.As to Britain forming its own free trade area, it seems an awfully long shot and on balance it is unlikely, not least because there are not that many free countries around available to recruit into another free trade area.Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.  fter Brexit, there will be two possibilities.The first and easiest would be that the negotiators come up with a reciprocal deal that keeps the current arrangements, or something a bit like them, in place.If they don't, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, ""I paid in there"", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, and Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.It's complicated. On the face of it, it looks like once we have triggered Article 50 we are locked in, and that is certainly how the European Parliament reads it.And there is a view that if we were in this two-year process after triggering Article 50 and we wanted to get out of it, then ultimately that would be a decision for the European Court of Justice.But the EU top brass never miss an opportunity to tell us what a big mistake they think we are making.So although suddenly announcing we don't want to leave after all would involve a huge loss of face, other European leaders might help it happen, whatever the legal protocol but all 28 EU members would have to agree."
